## **Homotopy types**

Traditionally, mathematics and physics have been [[foundations|founded]] on _[[sets]]_, "bags of points". But fundamental [[physics]] is all governed by the [[gauge principle]] which says that fundamentally the points in these bags are connected, possibly, by various [[gauge transformation]] [[equivalences]]. In fact fundamental physics involves [[higher gauge theory]], which asserts that in general there are [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]] between these gauge transformations, and so ever on. This means that what naively may have looked like spaces made of points are really in general like [[orbifolds]], "[[orbispaces]]". Since these are generalizations of [[groups]] of [[symmetries]] to a situation where symmetries act on and between various objects, one speaks of _[[groupoids]]_, and if the ever higher [[gauge-of-gauge equivalences]] are taken into account one speaks of _[[infinity-groupoids]]_. The field of mathematics that studies these structures is called _[[homotopy theory]]_. Here "[[gauge equivalences]]" are also called _[[homotopies]]_ and [[n-groupoids]] (structures with $n$-fold [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]) are called _[[homotopy n-types]]_.

Here we discuss the basics of [[homotopy theory]] irrespective of any [[geometry]]. In the next chapter _[[geometry of physics -- smooth homotopy types]]_ we then combine the concept of _[[geometry of physics -- smooth spaces|smooth sets]]_ of the previous chapter with the idea of generalizing sets to _[[smooth homotopy types]]_. These subsume the objects of actual interest in physics, such as notably the [[moduli stacks]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] in any [[gauge theory]] and [[higher gauge theory]].


### Motivation

The basic principle of [[homotopy theory]] happens to be well familiar in [[physics]], just in slight disguise: it is the ([[higher gauge theory|higher]]) _[[gauge principle]]_. This we explain in 

* _[Motivation from physics: The gauge principle](#TheGaugePrinciple)_.

As it goes, this profound and yet simple fact is less widely appreciated than a rather sophisticated phenomenon which is but a special case of this: the appearance of [[derived categories]] of [[branes]] in [[topological string theory]]

* _[Motivation from physics: Derived categories of branes](#DerivedCategoriesOfBranes)_

The historical route in [[mathematics]] that lead to modern [[homotopy theory]] so happens to run via the study of [[ordinary cohomology]] and [[ordinary homology]] ([[singular homology]]) of [[topological spaces]], structures that happen to recognize of a topological space only the [[homotopy type]] that it _represents_ via the [[singular simplicial complex]] construction. This traditional route we recall in 

* _[Motivation from topologogy: Singular homology](#SimplicialHomology)_.

While standard and traditional, this story hides a bit how utmost fundamental the principles of [[homotopy theory]] are and tends to misleadingly suggest that homotopy theory is a sub-topic of [[topology]]. Contrary to that, inspection of the [[foundations of mathematics]] reveals the foundational nature of homotopy theory. This we indicate in 

* _[Motivation from first principles: Homtopy type-theory](#MotivationFromFirstPrinciples)_.



#### Motivation from physics

#####The gauge principle
 {#MotivationFromGaugePrinciple}

One of the fundamental principles of modern physics is the _[[gauge principle]]_. It says that every [[field (physics)|field]] configuration in physics -- hence absolutely everything in physics -- is, in general, a _[[gauge field]]_ configuration. This in turn means that given two field configurations $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, then it makes no sense to ask whether they are _[[equality|equal]]_ or not. Instead what makes sense to ask for is a [[gauge transformation]] $g$ that, if it exists, exhibits $\Phi_1$ as being gauge [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $\Phi_2$ via $g$:

$$
  \Phi_1 \underoverset{\simeq}{g}{\longrightarrow} \Phi_2
  \,.
$$

This satisfies obvious rules, so obvious that physics textbooks usually don't bother to mention this. First of all, if there is yet another field configuration $\Phi_3$ and a gauge transformation $g'$ from $\Phi_2$ to $\Phi_3$, then there is also the [[composition|composite]] gauge transformation

$$
  g' \circ g
  \Phi_1 \underoverset{\simeq}{g}{\longrightarrow} \Phi_2
  \underoverset{\simeq}{g'}{\longrightarrow}
  \Phi_3
$$

and this [[composition]] is [[associative]].

Moreover, these being [[equivalences]] means that they have [[inverses]], 

$$
  \Phi_2 \underoverset{\simeq}{g^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \Phi_1
$$

such that the compositions

$$
  \Phi_1 \underoverset{\simeq}{g}{\longrightarrow} \Phi_2
  \underoverset{\simeq}{g^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \Phi_1
$$

and

$$
  \Phi_1 \underoverset{\simeq}{g}{\longrightarrow} \Phi_2
  \underoverset{\simeq}{g^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \Phi_1
$$

equal the [[identity]] transformation. 

Obvious as this may be, in [[mathematics]] such [[structure]] gets a name: this is a _[[groupoid]]_ or _[[homotopy 1-type]]_ whose _[[objects]]_ are [[field (physics)|field configurations]] and whose _[[morphisms]]_ are [[gauge transformations]].

But notice that in the last statement above about inverses, we were actually violating the [[gauge principle]]: we asked for a gauge transformation of the form $g^{-1}\circ g$ (transforming one way and then just transforming back) to be [[equality|equal]] to the identity transformation $id$.

But the gauge principle applies also to gauge transformations themselves. This is the content of [[higher gauge theory]]. For instance a 2-form gauge field such as the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] has [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]. In the physics literature these are best known in their [[infinitesimal]] approximation, which are called [[ghost-of-ghost fields]] (for some historical reasons). In fact physicists know the [[infinitesimal]] "[[Lie algebroid]]" version of [[Lie groupoids]] and their higher versions as [[BRST complexes]].

This means that in general it makes no sense to ask whether two gauge transformations are equal or not. What makes sense is to ask for a [[gauge-of-gauge transformation]] that turns one into the other

$$
  \array{
     \Phi_1 & \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & \Phi_2
     \\
     & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     \Phi_1 & \underset{g'}{\longrightarrow} & \Phi_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Now it is clear that gauge-of-gauge transformations may be composed with each other, and that, being [[equivalences]], they have inverses under this composition. Moreover, this composition of gauge-of-gauge transformations is to be compatible with the already existing composition of the first order gauge transformations themselves.
This structure, when made explicit, is in mathematics called a _[[2-groupoid]]_ or _[[homotopy 2-type]]_.

But now it is clear that this pattern continues: next we may have a yet [[higher gauge theory]], for instance that of a 3-form [[C-field]], and then there are third order gauge transformations which we must use to identify, when possible, second order gauge transformations. They may in turn be composed and have inverses under this composition, and the resulting structure, when made explicit, is called a _[[3-groupoid]]_ or _[[homotopy 3-type]]_.

This logic of the [[gauge principle]] keeps applying, and hence we obtain an infinite sequence of concepts, which at stage $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are called _[[n-groupoids]]_ or _[[homotopy n-types]]_. The limiting case where we never assume that some high order gauge-of-gauge transformation has no yet higher order transformations between them, the structure in this limiting case accordingly goes by the name of _[[infinity-groupoid]]_ or just _[[homotopy type]]_.

The mathematics theory of these systems of higher-order gauge-of-gauge transformations is called _[[homotopy theory]]_ or _[[higher category theory]]_ in the flavor of _[[(infinity,1)-category theory]]_.

##### Derived categories of branes
 {#DerivedCategoriesOfBranes}

...[[topological string]]... [[TCFT]] ... [[homological mirror symmetry]] ...



#### Motivation from topology: Singular homology
 {#SimplicialHomology}


This section recalls how the "abelianization" of a [[topological space]] by _[[nLab:singular chains]]_ gives rise to the notion of _[[nLab:chain complexes]]_ and their _[[nLab:homology]]_.

This proceeds in three steps: given a [[topological space]], first one passes to the collection of [[simplices]] in it (the curves, triangles, tetrahedra, ...) which together form a _[[simplicial set]]_. Then one "linearizes" this by forming the [[free abelian groups]] on the simplices to obtain a [[simplicial abelian group]]. Finally one turns the resulting [[simplicial abelian group]] into a [[chain complex]]. 

Below in _[Dold-Kan correspondence](#DoldKanCorrespondence)_ we see that this last step is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalent reformulation]], and that from any chain complex (in non-negative degree) one may re-obtain the [[simplicial abelian group]] that it corresponds to. Further below in _[Kan complexes](#KanComplexes)_ we see that (forgetting the group structure on these), these are _[[Kan complexes]]_ and as such objects in [[simplicial homotopy theory]]. This we then turn to further below in _[Simplicial homotopy theory](#SimplicialHomotopyTheory)_.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[topological n-simplex](simplex#TopologicalSimplex)** is, 
up to [[nLab:homeomorphism]], the [[nLab:topological space]] whose underlying set is the subset

$$
  \Delta^n \coloneqq 
  \{
    \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    |
    \sum_{i = 0 }^n x_i = 1 \; and \;
    \forall i . x_i \geq 0 
  \}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

of the [[nLab:Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and whose topology is the  [[nLab:subspace topology]] induces from the canonical topology in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

###### Remark

The [[coordinate]] expression in def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} -- also known as _[barycentric coordinates](simplex#BarycentricCoordinates)_ -- is evidently just one of many possible ways to present topological $n$-simplices. Another common choice are what are called _[Cartesian coordinates](simplex#CartesianCoordinates)_. Of course nothing of relevance will depend on which choice of coordinate presentation is used, but some are more convenient in some situations than others.

###### Example

For $n = 0$ this is the [[nLab:point]], $\Delta^0 = *$.

For $n = 1$ this is the standard [[nLab:interval object]] $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$.

For $n = 2$ this is the filled triangle.

For $n = 3$ this is the filled tetrahedron.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$, the 
**$k$th $(n-1)$-face (inclusion)**  of the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, is the subspace inclusion

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
$$

induced under the coordinate presentation of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex},
by the inclusion 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

which "omits" the $k$th canonical coordinate:

of the "right" end of the standard interval. The other inclusion

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \lt n$ the **$k$th degenerate $(n)$-simplex (projection)** is the surjective map

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n} \to \Delta^{n-1}
$$

induced under the [barycentric coordinates](simplex#BarycentricCoordinates) of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} under the surjection

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which sends

$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[Top]] a [[topological space]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]], a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[nLab:continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
$$

from the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, to $X$.

Write 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n , X)
$$ 

for the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$.

=--


So to a [[nLab:topological space]] $X$ is associated a sequence of sets 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n, X)
$$

of [[nLab:singular simplices]]. Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}
$$

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n
$$

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$
  s_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\sigma_k,X) : (Sing X)_{n} \to (Sing X)_{n+1}
$$

that regard an $n$-simplex as beign a degenerate ("thin") $(n+1)$-simplex.
All these sets of simplicies and face and degeneracy maps between them form the following structure. 

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialSet}
###### Definition

A **[[nLab:simplicial set]]** $S \in sSet$ is 

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[nLab:set]] $S_n \in Set$ -- the **set of $n$-[[nLab:simplices]]**;

* for each [[nLab:injective map]] $\delta_i : \overline{n-1} \to \overline{n}$ of [[nLab:totally ordered sets]] $\bar n \coloneqq \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n \}$

  a [[nLab:function]] $d_i : S_{n} \to S_{n-1}$ -- the $i$th **face map** on $n$-simplices;

* for each [[nLab:surjective map]] $\sigma_i : \overline{n+1} \to \bar n$ of [[nLab:totally ordered sets]]

  a [[nLab:function]] $\sigma_i : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}$ -- the $i$th **degeneracy map** on $n$-simplices;

such that these functions satisfy the _[[nLab:simplicial identities]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialIdentities}
###### Proposition

These face and degeneracy maps satisfy the following **simplicial identities**   (whenever the maps are composable as indicated):

1. $ d_i \circ d_j  = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ if $i \lt j$,

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

1. $d_i \circ s_j =  \left\{ \array{ s_{j-1} \circ d_i &  if \;  i \lt j \\ id & if  \;  i = j \; or \; i = j+1 \\ s_j \circ d_{i-1} &  if i \gt j+1 } \right. $

=--

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[nLab:singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. We now briefly indicate a systematic way to see this using basic [[nLab:category theory]], but the reader already satisfied with this statement should skip ahead to the _[Singular chain complex](#MotivationSingularChainComplex)_.

###### Definition

The **[[nLab:simplex category]]** $\Delta$ is the [[nLab:full subcategory]] of [[nLab:Cat]] on the free categories of the form

$$

    [0] & \coloneqq \{0\}
    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}
    \\

$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[nLab:spine]]" of the $n$-[[nLab:simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\
     & \nearrow && \searrow
     \\

  }

###### Proposition

A [[nLab:functor]] 

$$
  S : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

from the [[nLab:opposite category]] of the [[nLab:simplex category]] to the category [[nLab:Set]] of sets is canonically identified with a [[nLab:simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the simplicial identities 
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

=--

This makes the following evident:

###### Example

The [[nLab:topological simplices]] from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} arrange into a _[[nLab:cosimplicial object]] in [[nLab:Top]]_, namely a [[nLab:functor]]

$$
  \Delta^\bullet : \Delta \to Top
  \,.
$$

=--

With this now the structure of a simplicial set on $(Sing X)_\bullet$ is manifest: it is just the _[[nLab:nerve]]_ of $X$ with respect to $\Delta^\bullet$, namely:

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] its **[[nLab:singular simplicial complex|simplicial set of singular simplicies]]**  (often called the **[[nLab:singular simplicial complex]]**)

$$
  (Sing X)_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[nLab:hom functor]] of [[nLab:Top]]:

$$
  (Sing X) : [n] \mapsto Hom_{Top}( \Delta^n , X )

###### Remark (aside)

It turns out that that [[nLab:homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$ (this is the content of the _[[nLab:homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_).

###### Definition

A **formal linear combination** of elements of a [[nLab:set]] 
$S \in $ [[nLab:Set]] is a [[nLab:function]] 

$$
  a : S \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

such that only finitely many of the values $a_s \in \mathbb{Z}$ are non-zero.

Identifying an element $s \in S$ with the function
$S \to \mathbb{Z}$, which sends $s$ to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and all other elements to 0, this is written as

$$
  a = \sum_{s \in S} a_s \cdot s
  \,.
$$

In this expression one calls $a_s \in \mathbb{Z}$ the [[nLab:coefficient]] of $s$ in the formal linear combination.

For $S \in $ [[nLab:Set]], the **group of formal linear combinations** $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ is the [[nLab:group]] whose underlying [[nLab:set]] is that of formal linear combinations, 
def. \ref{FormalLinearCombination}, and whose group operation is 
the pointwise addition in $\mathbb{Z}$:

$$
  (\sum_{s \in S} a_s \cdot s)

defined on [[nLab:basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ to be the alternating sum of the simplicial face maps:

By linearity, it is sufficient to check this on a basis element $\sigma \in S_n$. There we compute as follows:

    & = 
    \partial \left(
      \sum_{j = 0}^n (-1)^j d_j \sigma
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \sum_{j=0}^n \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
    \\
     & =
     \sum_{0 \leq i \lt j \leq n} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
     + 
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma

     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & = 
     - 
     \sum_{0 \leq i \leq j \lt n} (-1)^{i+j} d_{j} d_i \sigma
     + 
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\

Here 

1. the first equality is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential);

1. the second is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential) together with the linearity of $d$;

1. the third is obtained by decomposing the sum into two summands;

1. the fourth finally uses the simplicial identity prop. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} (1) in the first summand;

1. the fifth relabels the summation index $j$ by $j +1$;

In particular $\sigma$ is a 1-[[nLab:cycle]] precisely if $\sigma(0) = \sigma(1)$, hence precisely if $\sigma$ is a [[nLab:loop space|loop]].

Let $\sigma^2 : \Delta^2 \to X$ be a singular 2-chain. The boundary is

$$
  \partial
  \left(

       && \sigma(1)

       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^{1,2}}}
       \\

Specifically for $S = Sing X$ we call this the **[[nLab:singular chain complex]]** of $X$.

This motivates the general definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #ChainComplexes}
###### Definition

A _[[nLab:chain complex]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]]_ $C_\bullet$ is a collection
$\{C_n \in Ab\}_{n}$ of abelian groups together with group homomorphisms $\{\partial_n : C_{n+1} \to C_n\}$ such that $\partial \circ \partial = 0$.

=--

We turn to this definition in more detail in the [below](#CategoriesOfChainComplexes). The thrust of this construction lies in the fact that the chain complex $C_\bullet(Sing X)$ remembers the [[nLab:abelianization|abelianized]] [[nLab:fundamental group]] of $X$, as well as aspects of the higher [[nLab:homotopy groups]]: in its _[[nLab:chain homology]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet(S)$ a chain complex as in def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}, and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we say

* an $n$-[[nLab:chain]] of the form $\partial \sigma \in C(S)_n$ is an **$n$-[[nLab:boundary]]**;

* a [[nLab:chain]] $\sigma \in C_n(S)$ is an **$n$-[[nLab:cycle]]** if $\partial \sigma = 0$

  (every 0-chain is a 0-cycle).

By linearity of $\partial$ the boundaries and cycles form abelian sub-groups of the group of chains, and we write

$$
  B_n \coloneqq im(\partial_n) \subset C_n(S)
$$

for the group of $n$-boundaries, and

$$
  Z_n \coloneqq ker(\partial_n) \subset C_(S)
$$

for the group of $n$-cycles.

+-- {: .num_remark }

This means that a [[nLab:singular chain]] is a [[nLab:cycle]] if the formal linear combination of the oriented [[nLab:boundaries]] of all its constituent [[nLab:singular simplices]] sums to 0.

###### Remark

More generally, for $R$ any unital [[nLab:ring]] one can form the degreewise [[nLab:free module]] $R[Sing X]$ over $R$. The corresponding homology is the _singular homology with coefficients in $R$, denoted $H_n(X,R)$. This generality we come to below in the next section.

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularHomology}
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet(S)$ a chain complex as in def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet} and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **degree-$n$ [[nLab:chain homology]] group**
$H_n(C(S)) \in Ab$ is the [[nLab:quotient group]] 

$$
  H_n(C(S)) \coloneqq \frac{ker(\partial_{n-1})}{im(\partial_n)}
  =
  \frac{Z_n}{B_n}
$$

of the $n$-[[nLab:cycles]] by the $n$-[[nLab:boundaries]] -- where for $n = 0$ we declare that $\partial_{-1} \coloneqq 0$ and hence $Z_0 \coloneqq C_0$.

Specifically, the [[nLab:chain homology]] of $C_\bullet(Sing X)$ is called the **[[nLab:singular homology]]** of the [[nLab:topological space]] $X$.


=--

One usually writes $H_n(X, \mathbb{Z})$ or just $H_n(X)$ for the singular homology of $X$ in degree $n$.

+-- {: .num_remark }

So $H_0(C_\bullet(S)) = C_0(S)/im(\partial_0)$.

###### Example

For $X$ a [[nLab:topological space]] we have that the degree-0 singular homology

$$
  H_0(X) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]
$$

is the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the set of [[nLab:connected components]] of $X$.

$$
  H_n(X) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The precise choice of this [[nLab:isomorphism]] is a choice of [[nLab:orientation]] on $X$. With a choice of orientation, the element $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ under this identification is called the **[[nLab:fundamental class]]** 

$$
  [X] \in H_n(X)
$$

of the manifold $X$.

+-- {: .num_defn #PushforwardOfChains}
###### Definition

Given a [[nLab:continuous map]] $f : X \to Y$ between [[nLab:topological spaces]], 
and given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every singular $n$-simplex $\sigma : \Delta^n \to X$ in $X$ is sent to a singular $n$-simplex 

$$
  f_* \sigma : \Delta^n \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
$$

in $Y$. This is called the **push-forward** of $\sigma$ along $f$. Accordingly there is a push-forward map on groups of singular chains

$$
  (f_*)_n : C_n(X) \to C_n(Y)
  \,. 
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #PushForwardChainMap}
###### Proposition

These push-forward maps make all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
     C_{n+1}(X) &\stackrel{(f_*)_{n+1}}{\to}& C_{n+1}(Y)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^X_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^Y_n}}
     \\
     C_n(X) &\stackrel{(f_*)_n}{\to}& C_n(Y)
  }
$$

commute.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is in fact evident that push-forward yields a functor of [[nLab:singular simplicial complexes]]

$$
 f_* : Sing X \to Sing Y
 \,.
$$

From this the statement follows since $\mathbb{Z}[-] : sSet \to sAb$ is a functor.

=--

Therefore we have an "abelianized analog" of the notion of [[nLab:topological space]]:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet$ two [[nLab:chain complexes]], def. \ref{ChainComplexes}, a [[nLab:homomorphism]] between them -- called a **[[nLab:chain map]]** $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$  -- is for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a homomorphism $f_n : C_n \to D_n$ of abelian groups, such that $f_n \circ \partial^C_n = \partial^D_n \circ f_{n+1}$:

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^C_{n+1}}}
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^D_{n+1}}}

    C_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\to}& D_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^C_n}}
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^D_n}}

    \\
    \vdots && \vdots

$$

Composition of such chain maps is given by degreewise composition of their components. Clearly, chain complexes with chain maps between them hence form a [[nLab:category]] -- the _[[nLab:category of chain complexes]]_ in [[nLab:abelian groups]], --  which we write 

$$
  Ch_\bullet(Ab))
  \in 
  Cat
  \,.
$$

Accordingly we have:

+-- {: .num_prop #SingularHomologyAsAFunctor}
###### Proposition

Sending a topological space to its singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$, def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}, and a continuous map to its push-forward chain map, 
prop. \ref{PushForwardChainMap}, constitutes a [[nLab:functor]]

$$
  C_\bullet(-) : Top \to Ch_\bullet(Ab)
$$

from the category [[nLab:Top]] of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the [[nlaB:category of chain complexes]].

In particular for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ singular homology extends to a [[nLab:functor]]

$$
  H_n(-) : Top \to Ab
  \,.
$$

=--


We close this section by stating the basic properties of [[nLab:singular homology]], which make precise the sense in which it is an abelian approximation to the [[nLab:homotopy type]] of $X$. The proof of these statements requires some of the tools of homological algebra that we develop in the later chapters, as well as some tools in [[nLab:algebraic topology]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $f : X \to Y$ is a [[nLab:continuous map]] between [[nLab:topological spaces]] which is a [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]], then the induced morphism on singular homology groups

$$
  H_n(f) : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]].

=--

(A proof (via [[nLab:CW approximations]]) is spelled out for instance in ([Hatcher, prop. 4.21](#Hatcher))).

We therefore also have an "abelian analog" of weak homotopy equivalences: 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet$ two [[nLab:chain complexes]], 
a [[nLab:chain map]] $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$ is called a **[[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]** if it induces [[nLab:isomorphisms]] on all [[nLab:homology groups]]:

$$
  f_n : H_n(C) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(D)
  \,.
$$


=--

In summary: **chain homology sends [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalences]] to [[nLab:quasi-isomorphisms]]**. Quasi-isomorphisms of chain complexes are the abelianized analog of weak homotopy equivalences of topological spaces.

In particular we have the analog of prop. \ref{ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}:

+-- {: .num_prop #ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:relation]] "There exists a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]] from $C_\bullet$ to $D_\bullet$." is a [[nLab:reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[nLab:transitive relation]], but it is not a [[nLab:symmetric relation]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Reflexivity and transitivity are evident. An explicit counter-example 
showing the non-symmetry is the [[nLab:chain map]]

$$
  \array{
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
     \\
     \cdots && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \cdots
     \\
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
  }
$$

from the chain complex concentrated on the morphism of multiplication by 2 on integers, to the chain complex concentrated on the [[nLab:cyclic group of order 2]].


This clearly induces an isomorphism on all homology groups. But there is not even a non-zero chain map in the other direction, since there is no non-zero group homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$.

=--

Accordingly, as for [[nLab:homotopy types]] of topological spaces, in [[nLab:homological algebra]] one regards two [[nLab:chain complexes]] 
$C_\bullet$, $D_\bullet$ as essentially equivalent -- "of the same weak homology type" -- if there is a [[zigzag]] of quasi-isomorphisms

$$
  C_\bullet \leftarrow \to \leftarrow \cdots \to D_\bullet
$$

between them. This is made precise by the central notion of the _[[nLab:derived category]]_ of chain complexes. We turn to this below in section _[Derived categories and derived functors](#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors)_.


But quasi-isomorphisms are a little _coarser_ than weak homotopy equivalences. The singular chain functor $C_\bullet(-)$ forgets some of the information in the [[nLab:homotopy types]] of topological spaces. The following series of statements characterizes to some extent what exactly is lost when passing to singular homology, and which information is in fact retained.

First we need a comparison map:

+-- {: .num_defn #HurewiczHomomorphism}
###### Definition 
**(Hurewicz homomorphism)**

For $(X,x)$ a [[nLab:pointed object|pointed]] [[nLab:topological space]], the **Hurewicz homomorphism** is the [[nLab:function]]

$$
  \Phi : \pi_k(X,x) \to H_k(X)
$$

from the $k$th [[nLab:homotopy group]] of $(X,x)$ to the $k$th [[nLab:singular homology]] group defined by sending

$$
  \Phi : (f : S^k \to X)_{\sim} \mapsto f_*[S_k]
$$

a representative singular $k$-sphere $f$ in $X$ to the push-forward along $f$ of the [[nLab:fundamental class]] $[S_k] \in H_k(S^k)$, example \ref{FundamentalClass}.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[nLab:topological space]] the Hurewicz homomorphism in degree 0 exhibits an [[nLab:isomorphism]] between the [[nLab:free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]$ on the set of path [[nLab:connected components]] of $X$ and the degree-0 singular homlogy:

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]
   \simeq
  H_0(X)
  \,.
$$

=--


Since a [[nLab:homotopy group]] in positive degree depends on the [[nLab:homotopy type]] of the [[nLab:connected component]] of the base point, while the singular homology does not depend on a basepoint, it is interesting to compare these groups only for the case that $X$ is connected.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[nLab:path-connected topological space]] the [[nLab:Hurewicz homomorphism]]
in degree 1

$$
  \Phi : \pi_1(X,x) \to H_1(X)
$$

is [[nLab:surjection|surjective]]. Its [[nLab:kernel]] is the [[nLab:commutator subgroup]]
of $\pi_1(X,x)$. Therefore it induces an [[nLab:isomorphism]] from the [[nLab:abelianization]] $\pi_1(X,x)^{ab} \coloneqq \pi_1(X,x)/[\pi_1,\pi_1]$:


$$
  \pi_1(X,x)^{ab}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_1(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

For higher connected $X$ we have the 

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $X$ is [[nLab:n-connected object in an (infinity,1)-topos|(n-1)-connected]] for $n \geq 2$ then

$$
  \Phi : \pi_n(X,x) \to H_n(X)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]].

=--

This is known as the _[[nLab:Hurewicz theorem]]_.

This gives plenty of motivation for studying 

1. [[nLab:chain complexes]]

1. [[nLab:chain homology]]

1. [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]

of chain complexes. This is essentially what [[nLab:homological algebra]] is about. In the next section we start to develop these notions more systematically.

(...[[type theory]]... [[identity type]]... [[homotopy type theory]]...)

### **Model layer**

A _[[homotopy 0-type]]_ is equivalently just a [[set]] (an [[h-set]]). A _[[homotopy 1-type]]_ is equivalently a _[[groupoid]]_. These we introduce and discuss below in 

* _[Groupoids -- Homotopy 1-types](#Groupoids)_.

A standard model for general [[homotopy types]] are _[[simplicial sets]]_ and in particular the _[[Kan complexes]]_ among them. These we introduce and discuss below in 

* _[Kan complexes --  General homotopy types](#KanComplexes)_. 

This model for [[homotopy theory]] is accordingly known as _[[simplicial homotopy theory]]_. This is a powerful model and happens to be the most highly developed one, it does however require a minimum of mathematical sophistication to be handled efficiently. This we look into below in 

* _[Simplicial homotopy theory](#SimplicialHomotopyTheory)_.

But a simpler and more familiar structure turns out to be a model for the important subsector of "abelian" homotopy types, namely _[[chain complexes]]_. We recall fundamentals of these in 

* _[Chain complexes --  Abelian homotopy types](#ChainComplexes)_. 

As a model for abelian homotopy theory, this is nothing but _[[homological algebra]]_. We present the key constructions of homological algebra from the "derived" perspective that makes them fit well into homotopy theory below in

* _[Abelian homtopy theory](#AbelianHomotopyTheory)_.

The construction that embeds chain complexes into simplicial homotopy theory is the _[[Dold-Kan correspondence]]_ and the _[[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]_. This we discuss below in 

* _[Dold-Kan correspondence](#DoldKanCorrespondence)_

  $$

* $\circ$ defines a partial [[composition]] operation which is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]] for $i(\mathcal{G}_0)$ the [[identities]]; in particular

  $s (g \circ f) = s(f)$ and $t (g \circ f) = t(g)$;

The functions $p_1, p_2, \circ \colon \mathcal{G}_2 \to \mathcal{G}_1$ are those which send, respectively, these triangular diagrams to the left morphism, or the right morphism, or the bottom morphism.

For $G$ a [[group]], its [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet$ has

* $(\mathbf{B}G)_1 = G$.

For $G$ and $K$ two groups, group homomorphisms $f \colon G \to K$
are in [[natural bijection]] with groupoid homomorphisms
$$

In

Here, for the time being, all groups are [[discrete groups]]. Since the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ also has a standard structure of a [[Lie group]], and since later for the discussion of Chern-Simons type theories this will be relevant, we will write from now on

For $X $ a [[set]], $G$ a [[discrete group]] and $\rho \colon X \times G \to X$ an [[action]] of $G$ on $X$ (a [[permutation representation]]), the **[[action groupoid]]** or **[[homotopy quotient]]** of $X$ by $G$ is the groupoid

with composition induced by the product in $G$. Hence this is the groupoid whose objects are the elements of $X$, and where [[morphisms]] are of the form

$$
  x_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} x_2 = \rho(x_1)(g)

$$

Another canonical action is the action of $G$ on itself by right multiplication. The corresponding action groupoid we write

$$

Using remark \ref{FiberProductsOfGroupoidsComponentwise} 
the limiting cone is seen to precisely pick those morphisms in $(\mathbf{B}G_\bullet)^I_\bullet$ such that these two elements are constant on the neutral element $h_1 = h_2 = e = id_{\ast}$, hence it produces just the elements of $G$ regarded as a groupoid with only identity morphisms, as in example \ref{SetAsGroupoid}.

###### Proof

Notice that $\Pi_1(S^0) \simeq \ast \coprod \ast$. Therefore
the [[path space object]] $[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet$ has

* objects are pairs of morphisms in $X_\bullet$;

* morphisms are commuting squares of such.

Now the fiber product in def. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductOfGroupoids}
picks in there those pairs of morphisms for which both start at the same object, and both end at the same object. Therefore $X_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} [\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} X$ is the groupoid whose

* objects are diagrams in $X_\bullet$ of the form

* morphism are cylinder-diagrams over these.

One finds along the lines of example

In terms of [[nLab:elements]] this means that

Notice that this is _not_ a group homomorphism out of the product group.
The product group $A \times B$ is the group whose elements are pairs $(a,b)$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, and whose group operation is

A _[[nLab:group homomorphism]]_

$$

hence satisfies

$$
  \phi( a_1+a_2, b_1 + b_2 ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(a_2, b_2)

and hence in particular

$$
  \phi( a_1+a_2, b_1  ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(a_2, 0)

$$
  \phi( a_1, b_1 + b_2 ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(0, b_2)

Equipped with the tensor product $\otimes$ of def. \ref{ExplicitTensorProduct} [[nlab:Ab]] becomes a [[nLab:monoidal category]]. 

The [[nLab:unit object]] in $(Ab, \otimes)$ is the additive group of [[nLab:integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$. 

=--

This means: 

1. forming the tensor product is a [[nLab:functor]] in each argument

   $$
     A \otimes (-) : Ab \to Ab
     \,,
   $$

1. there is an [[nLab:associativity law|associativity]] [[nLab:natural isomorphism]] $(A \otimes B) \otimes C \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A \otimes (B \otimes C) $ which is "[[nLab:coherence law|coherent]]" in the sense that all possible ways of using it to rebracket a given expression are equal.

1. There is a [[nLab:unit law|unit]] [[nLab:natural isomorphism]] $A \otimes \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A$ which is compatible with the asscociativity isomorphism in the evident sense.


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $\mathbb{Z}$ is the unit object, consider for any abelian group $A$ the map

$$
  A \otimes \mathbb{Z} \to A
$$

which sends for $n \in \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$

$$
  (a, n) \mapsto n \cdot a \coloneqq \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{n\;summands}
  \,.
$$

Due to the quotient relation defining the tensor product, the element on the left is also equal to 

$$
  (a, n) = (a, \underbrace{1 + 1 \cdots + 1}_{n\; summands})
  =
  \underbrace{ (a,1) + (a,1) + \cdots + (a,1) }_{n\; summands}
  \,.
$$

This shows that $A \otimes \mathbb{Z} \to A$ is in fact an [[nLab:isomorphism]].

The other properties are similarly direct to check.

We see simple but useful examples of tensor products of abelian groups put to work below in the context of example \ref{SquareAsTensorProduct} and then in many of the applications to follow. An elementary but not entirely trivial example that may help to illustrate the nature of the tensor product is the following.

###### Example

For $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ and positive, we have

$$
  \mathbb{Z}_a \otimes \mathbb{Z}_b \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{LCM(a,b)}
  \,,
$$

where $LCM(-,-)$ denotes the [[nLab:least common multiple]].

###### Definition

Let $I \in $ [[nLab:Set]] be a [[nLab:set]] and $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ an $I$-indexed family of abelian groups. The **[[nLab:direct sum]]** $\oplus_{i \in I} \in Ab$ is the [[nLab:coproduct]] of these objects in [[nLab:Ab]].

This means: the direct sum is an abelian group equipped with a collection of 
homomorphisms

$$
  \array{
    A_j &&\cdots && A_k
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_j} }\searrow &\cdots& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_{k}}}
    \\
    && \oplus_{i \in I} A_i
  }
  \,,
$$

which is characterized (up to unique [[nLab:isomorphism]]) by the following [[nLab:universal property]]: for every other abelian group $K$ equipped with maps 

$$
  \array{
    A_j &&\cdots && A_k
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_j} }\searrow &\cdots& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{f_{k}}}
    \\
    && K
  }
$$

there is a unique homomorphism $\phi : \oplus_{i \in I} A_i \to K$ such that 
$ f_i = \phi \circ \iota_i$ for all $i \in I$.

Explicitly in terms of elements we have:

###### Proposition

The [[nLab:direct sum]] $\oplus_{i \in I} A_i$ is the abelian group whose ements are formal sums

$$

of _finitely_ many elements of the $\{A_i\}$, with addition given by componentwise addition in the corresponding $A_i$.

###### Example

If each $A_i = \mathbb{Z}$, then the direct sum is again the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on $I$

For $I \in Set$ and $A \in Ab$, the [[nLab:direct sum]] of ${\vert I\vert}$ copies of $A$ with itself is equivalently the [[nLab:tensor product of abelian groups]] of the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on $I$ with $A$:

The fact that the product is a [[nLab:bilinear map]] is the

$$
  r \cdot (r_1 + r_2) = r \cdot r_1 + r \cdot r_2

$$

is an [[nLab:equivalence of categories]] between that of topological spaces, and the [[nLab:opposite category]] of $C^\ast$-algebras. Together with remark \ref{SerreSwan} further below this provides a useful dual geometric way of thinking about the theory of modules.

The reader unfamiliar with the general concept of [[nLab:monomorphism]] and [[nLab:epimorphism]] may take the following to _define_ these in [[nLab:Ab]] to be simply the [[nLab:injections]] and [[nLab:surjections]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$U : R Mod \to Set$ preserves and reflects [[nLab:monomorphisms]] and [[nLab:epimorphisms]]:

A homomorphism $f : N_1 \to N_2$ in $R Mod$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]] / [[nLab:epimorphism]] precisely if $U(f)$ is an [[nLab:injection]] / [[nLab:surjection]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Suppose that $f$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]], hence that $f : N_1 \to N_2$ is such that for all morphisms $g_1, g_2 : K \to N_1$ such that $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$ already $g_1 = g_2$. Let then $g_1$ and $g_2$ be the inclusion of [[nLab:submodules]] generated by a single element $k_1 \in K$ and $k_2 \in K$, respectively. It follows that if $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$ then already $k_1 = k_2$ and so $f$ is an [[nLab:injection]].  Conversely, if $f$ is an injection then its image is a [[nLab:submodule]] and it follows directly that $f$ is a monomorphism.

Suppose now that $f$ is an [[nLab:epimorphism]] and hence that $f : N_1 \to N_2$ is such that for all morphisms $g_1, g_2 : N_2 \to K$ such that $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$ already $g_1 = g_2$. 
Let then $g_1 : N_2 \to \frac{N_2}{im(f)}$ be the natural projection. and let $g_2 : N_2 \to 0$ be the [[nLab:zero morphism]]. Since by construction $f \circ g_1 = 0$ and $f \circ g_2 = 0$ we have that $g_1 = 0$, which means that $\frac{N}{im(f)} = 0$ and hence that $N = im(f)$ and so that $f$ is surjective. The other direction is evident on elements.

In fact $R Mod$ is even a [[nLab:closed category]], but this we do not need for showing that it is abelian.

=--

Prop. \ref{RModHasZeroObject} and prop. \ref{RModIsAbEnriched} together say that:

+-- {: .num_cor #RModIsAdditive}
###### Corollary

$R Mod$ is an [[nLab:pre-additive category]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RModHasProductsAndCoproducts}
###### Proposition

$R Mod$ has all [[nLab:products]] and [[nLab:coproducts]], being [[nLab:direct products]] and  [[nLab:direct sums]]. 

The products are given by [[nLab:cartesian product]] of the underlying sets with componentwise addition and $R$-action.

The direct sum is the subobject of the product consisting of tuples of elements such that only finitely many are non-zero.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The defining [[nLab:universal properties]] are directly checked. Notice that the direct product $\prod_{i \in I} N_i$ consists of arbitrary tuples because it needs to have a projection map 

$$
  p_j : \prod_{i \in I} N_i \to N_j
$$

to each of the modules in the product, reproducing all of a possibly infinite number of non-trivial maps $\{K \to N_j\}$. On the other hand, the direct sum just needs to contain all the modules in the sum

$$
  \iota_j : N_j \to \oplus_{i \in I} N_i
$$

and since, being a module, it needs to be closed only under addition of _finitely_ many elements, so it consists only of [[nLab:linear combinations]] of the elements in the $N_j$, hence of finite formal sums of these.

=--



Together cor. \ref{RModIsAdditive} and prop. \ref{RModHasProductsAndCoproducts} say that:

###### Corollary

$R Mod$ is an [[nLab:additive category]].

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InRModMonosAreKernelOfTheirCokernel}
###### Proposition

In $R Mod$

* every [[nLab:monomorphism]] is the [[nLab:kernel]] of its [[nLab:cokernel]];

* every [[nLab:epimorphism]] is the [[nLab:cokernel]] of its [[nLab:kernel]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using prop. \ref{RModHasKernelsAndCokernels} this is directly checked on the underlying sets: given a monomorphism $K \hookrightarrow N$, its cokernel is $N \to \frac{N}{K}$, The kernel of that morphism is evidently $K \hookrightarrow N$.

=--

Now cor. \ref{RModIsAdditive} and prop. \ref{InRModMonosAreKernelOfTheirCokernel} imply theorem \ref{RModIsAbelian}, by definition.

Now we finally have all the ingredients to talk about chain complexes of $R$-modules. The following definitions are the direct analogs of the definitions of chain complexes of abelian groups in _[Simplicial and singular homology](#SimplicialHomology)_ above.

This establishes the basic objects that we are concerned with in the following. But as before, we are not so much interested in chain complexes up to chain map isomorphism, rather, we are interested in them up to a notion of [[nLab:homotopy]] equivalence. This we begin to study in the next section _[Homology exact sequences and homotopy fiber sequences](#HomotopyHomologyFiberSequence)_. But in order to formulate that neatly, it is useful to have the _[[nLab:tensor product of chain complexes]]_. We close this section with introducing that notion.

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorProductOfChainComplexes}
###### Definition

For $X, Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ write  $X \otimes Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the chain complex whose component in degree $n$ is given by the [[nLab:direct sum]]

$$
  (X \otimes Y)_n := \oplus_{i + j = n} X_i \otimes_R Y_j
$$

over all tensor products of components whose degrees sum to $n$,
and whose [[nLab:differential]] is given on elements $(x,y)$ of homogeneous degree by

$$
  \partial^{X \otimes Y} (x, y) = (\partial^X x, y) + (-1)^{deg(x)} (x, \partial^Y y)
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_example #SquareAsTensorProduct}
###### Example
**(square as tensor product of interval with itself)**

For $R$ some [[nLab:ring]], let $I_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(R Mod)$ be the chain complex given by

$$
  I_\bullet =
  \left[
     \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to R \stackrel{\partial^{I}_0}{\to} R \oplus R
  \right]
  \,,
$$

where $\partial^I_0 = (-id, id)$. 

This is the [[nLab:normalized chain complex]] of the [[nLab:chain on a simplicial set|simplicial chain complex]] of the standard simplicial interval, the 1-[[nLab:simplex]] $\Delta_1$, which means: we may think of 

$$
 I_0 = R \oplus R \simeq R[ \{(0), (1)\} ]
$$

as the $R$-[[nLab:linear span]] of two [[nLab:basis]] elements labelled "$(0)$" and "$(1)$", to be thought of as the two 0-[[nLab:chain on a simplicial set|chains]] on the endpoints of the interval. Similarly we may think of

$$
  I_1 = R \simeq R[\{(0 \to 1)\}]
$$

as the free $R$-module on the single basis element which is the unique non-degenerate 1-[[nLab:simplex]] $(0 \to 1)$ in $\Delta^1$.

Accordingly, the [[nLab:differential]] $\partial^I_0$ is the oriented [[nLab:boundary]] map of the interval, taking this basis element to

$$
  \partial^I_0 : (0 \to 1) \mapsto (1) - (0) 
$$

and hence a general element $r\cdot(0 \to 1)$ for some $r \in R$ to 

$$
  \partial^I_0 : r\cdot(0 \to 1) \mapsto r\cdot (1) - r\cdot(0) 
  \,.
$$

We now write out in full details the tensor product of chain complexes of $I_\bullet$ with itself, according to def. \ref{TensorProductOfChainComplexes}:

$$
  S_\bullet \coloneqq I_\bullet \otimes I_\bullet
  \,.
$$

By definition and using the above choice of [[nLab:basis]] element, this is in low degree given as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S_0 
    &=  
    I_0 \oplus I_0 
    \\
    & =
    (R \oplus R) \otimes (R \oplus R)
    \\
    & \simeq R \oplus R \oplus R \oplus R
    \\
    & = 
    \left\{
       r_{00} \cdot ((0),(0)')
       +
       r_{01} \cdot ((0),(1)')
       +
       r_{10} \cdot ((1),(0)')
       +
       r_{11} \cdot ((1),(1)')
       |
       r_{\cdot, \cdot} \in R
    \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the last line we express a general element as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements which are obtained as tensor products $(a,b) \in R\otimes R$ of the previous basis elements. Notice that by the definition of [[nLab:tensor product of modules]] we have relations like

$$
  r ( (0), (1)') = (r(0), (1)') = ((0), r(1)')
$$

etc. 

Similarly then, in degree-1 the tensor product chain complex is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     (I \otimes I)_1 
     & =
     (I_0 \otimes I_1) \oplus (I_1 \otimes I_0)
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \otimes (R \oplus R) \oplus (R \oplus R) \otimes R
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \oplus R \oplus R \oplus R
     \\
     & \simeq
     \left\{
       r_{0} \cdot ((0),(0\to 1)')
       + 
       r_{1} \cdot ((1), (0 \to 1)')
       + 
       \bar r_0 \cdot ((0\to 1), (0)')
       +
       \bar r_1 \cdot ((0 \to 1), (1)')
       |
       r_{\cdot}, \bar r_{\cdot} \in R
     \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

And finally in degree 2 it is 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     (I \otimes I)_2
     & \simeq
     I_1 \otimes I_1
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \otimes R
     \\
     & \simeq R
     \\
     & \simeq
     \left\{
       r\cdot ((0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
       |
       r \in R
     \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

All other contributions that are potentially present in $(I \otimes I)_\bullet$ vanish (are the [[nLab:trivial group|0-module]]) because all higher terms in $I_\bullet$ are.

The tensor product basis elements appearing in the above expressions have a clear [[nLab:geometry|geometric]] interpretation: we can label a square with them as follows

$$
  \array{
     ((0),(1)')
     &&\underset{((0\to 1),(0))}{\to}&&
     ((1),(1)')
     \\
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{((0),(0\to 1)')}}\uparrow 
     &&\righttoleftarrow^{((0 \to 1), (0\to 1)')}&& 
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{((1),(0 \to 1)')}}
     \\
     \\
     ((0),(0)')
     &&\underset{((0\to 1),(0)')}{\to}&&
     ((1),(0)')
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram indicates a [[nLab:cellular complex|cellular]] square and identifies its canonical [[nLab:singular chains]] with the elements of $(I \otimes I)_\bullet$. The arrows indicate the orientation. For instance the fact that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{I \otimes I} ((0 \to 1), (0)')
    & =
    (\partial^I (0 \to 1), (0)')
    + (-1)^1
    ((0\to 1), \partial^I (0))
    \\
    & = 
    ( (1) - (0), \;(0)' )
    - 0
    \\
    & = 
    ((1), (0)') - ((0), (0)')
  \end{aligned} 
$$

says that the oriented [[nLab:boundary]] of the bottom morphism is the bottom right element (its target) minus the bottom left element (its source), as indicated. Here we used that the differential of a degree-0 element in $I_\bullet$ is 0, and hence so is any tensor product with it.

Similarly the oriented boundary of the square itself is computed to

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{I \otimes I} ((0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
    &=
    (\partial^I (0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
    - 
    ((0 \to 1), \partial^I(0 \to 1))
    \\
    & = 
    ((1)- (0), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0 \to 1), (1)' - (0)')
    \\
    & = 
    ((1), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0 \to 1), (1)')
    +
    ((0 \to 1), (0)')
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

which can be read as saying that the boundary is the evident boundary thought of as oriented by drawing it _counterclockwise_ into the plane, so that the right arrow (which points up) contributes with a +1 prefactor, while the left arrow (which also points up) contributes with a -1 prefactor.

##### Homology exact sequences 
 {#HomotopyHomologyFiberSequence}

With the basic definition of the [[nLab:category of chain complexes]] in hand,
we now consider the first application, which is as simple as it is of ubiquituous use in [[nLab:mathematics]]: _[[nLab:long exact sequences in homology]]_. This is the "[[nLab:abelianization]]", in the sense of the discussion in [2)](#SimplicialHomology) above, of what in [[nLab:homotopy theory]] are _[[nLab:long exact sequences of homotopy groups]]_. But both concepts, in turn, are just the shadow on [[nLab:homology groups]]/[[nLab:homotopy groups]], respectively of [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequences]] of the underlying chain complexes/topological spaces themselves. Since these are even more useful, in particular in chapter [III)](#AbelianHomotopyTheory) below, we discuss below in [5)](#MappingCones) how to construct these using _[[nLab:chain homotopy]]_ and _[[nLab:mapping cones]]_.

First we need the fundamental notion of _exact sequences_. As before, we fix some [[nLab:commutative ring]] $R$ throughout and consider the [[nLab:category of modules]] over $R$, which we will abbreviate

$$
  \mathcal{A} \coloneqq R Mod
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #ExactSequence}
###### Definition

An **[[nLab:exact sequence]]** in $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[nLab:chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ in $\mathcal{A}$ with vanishing [[nLab:chain homology]] in each degree:

$$
  \forall n \in \mathbb{N} . H_n(C) = 0

###### Remark

A general exact sequence is sometimes called a **long exact sequence**, to distinguish from the special case of a short exact sequence.

Beware that there is a difference between $A \to B \to C$ being exact (at $B$) and $A \to B \to C$ being a "short exact sequence" in that $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is exact at $A$, $B$ and $C$. This is illustrated by the following proposition.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationOfShortExactSequences}
###### Proposition

Explicitly, a sequence of morphisms 

$$ 
  0 \to A \stackrel{i}\to B \stackrel{p}\to C  \to 0
$$

in $\mathcal{A}$ is short exact, def. \ref{ShortExactSequence}, precisely if

1. $i$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]],

1. $p$ is an [[nLab:epimorphism]], 

1. and the [[nLab:image]] of $i$ equals the [[nLab:kernel]] of $p$  (equivalently, the [[nLab:coimage]] of $p$ equals the [[nLab:cokernel]] of $i$).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The third condition is the definition of exactness at $B$. So we need to show that the first two conditions are equivalent to exactness at $A$ and at $C$.

This is easy to see by looking at elements when $\mathcal{A} \simeq R$[[nLab:Mod]], for some ring $R$ (and the general case can be reduced to this one using one of the [embedding theorems](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/abelian%20category#EmbeddingTheorems)):

The sequence being exact at 

$$
  0 \to A \to B
$$

means, since the [[nLab:image]] of $0 \to A$ is just the element $0 \in A$, that the [[nLab:kernel]] of $A \to B$ consists of just this element. But since $A \to B$ is a [[nLab:group homomorphism]], this means equivalently that $A \to B$ is an [[nLab:injection]]. 

Dually, the sequence being exact at

$$
  B \to C \to 0
$$

means, since the [[nLab:kernel]] of $C \to 0$ is all of $C$, that also the [[nLab:image]] of $B \to C$ is all of $C$, hence equivalently that $B \to C$ is a [[nLab:surjection]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #MultiplicationAndCyclicGroup}
###### Example

Let $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{Z}$[[nLab:Mod]] $\simeq$ [[nLab:Ab]]. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \geq 1$ let $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot n}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ be the [[nLab:linear map]]/[[nLab:homomorphism]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]] which acts by the ordinary multiplication of [[nLab:integers]] by $n$. This is clearly an [[nLab:injection]]. The [[nLab:cokernel]] of this morphism is the projection to the [[nLab:quotient group]], which is the [[nLab:cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Hence we have a short exact sequence

$$
  0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot n}{\to} \mathbb{Z}
  \to \mathbb{Z}_n
  \,.
$$

=--


A typical use of a long exact sequence, notably of the _[[nLab:homology long exact sequence]]_ to be discussed, is that it allows to determine some of its entries in terms of others.

The characterization of short exact sequences in prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfShortExactSequences} is one example for this. Another is this:

Often it is useful to make the following strengthening of short exactness explicit.

+-- {: .num_defn #SplitnessInAbelianCategory}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:short exact sequence]] $0\to A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{p}{\to} C\to 0$ in $\mathcal{A}$  is called **split** if either of the following equivalent conditions hold

1. There exists a [[nLab:section]] of $p$, hence a homomorphism $s \colon B\to C$ such that $p \circ s = id_C$.

1. There exists a [[nLab:retract]] of $i$, hence a homomorphism $r \colon B\to A$ such that $r \circ i = id_A$.

1. There exists an [[nLab:isomorphism]] of sequences with the sequence 

   $$
     0\to A\to A\oplus C\to C\to 0
   $$

   given by the [[nLab:direct sum]] and its canonical injection/projection morphisms.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SplittingLemma}
###### Proposition
**(splitting lemma)**

The three conditions in def. \ref{SplitnessInAbelianCategory} are indeed [[nLab:equivalence|equivalent]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the third condition implies the first two: take the section/retract to be given by the canonical injection/projection maps that come with a [[nLab:direct sum]].

Conversely, suppose we have a retract $r \colon B \to A$ of $i \colon A \to B$. Write $P \colon B \stackrel{r}{\to} A \stackrel{i}{\to} B$ for the composite.  Notice that by $r\circ i = id$ this is an [[nLab:idempotent]]: $P \circ P = P$, hence a [[nLab:projector]]. 

Then every element $b \in B$ can be decomposed as $b = (b - P(b)) + P(b)$ hence with $b - P(b) \in ker(r)$ and $P(b) \in im(i)$. Moreover this decomposition is unique since if $b = i(a)$ while at the same time $r(b) = 0$ then $0 = r(i(a)) = a$. This shows that $B \simeq im(i) \oplus ker(r)$ is a [[nLab:direct sum]] and that $i \colon A \to B$ is the canonical inclusion of $im(i)$. By exactness it then follows that $ker(r) \simeq ker(p)$ and hence that $B \simeq A \oplus C$ with the canonical inclusion and projection.

The implication that the second condition also implies the third is formally dual to this argument. 

=--


Moreover, of particular interest are exact sequences _of chain complexes_. We consider this concept in full beauty below in section [5)](#DoubleComplexesAndSalamander). In order to motivate the discussion there we here content ourselves with the following quick definition, which already admits discussion of some of its rich consequences.

+-- {: .num_defn #ShortExactSequenceOfChainComplexes}
###### Definition

A sequence of [[nLab:chain maps]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]]

$$
  0 \to A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to 0
$$

is a **short exact sequence of chain complexes** in $\mathcal{A}$ if for each $n$ the component

$$
  0 \to A_n \to B_n \to C_n \to 0
$$

is a short exact sequence in $\mathcal{A}$, according to def. \ref{ShortExactSequence}.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ConnectingForHomologyInComponents}
###### Definition

Consider a short exact sequence of chain complexes as in 
def. \ref{ShortExactSequenceOfChainComplexes}.
For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, define a [[nLab:group homomorphism]]

$$
  \delta_n : H_n(C) \to H_{n-1}(A)
  \,,
$$

called the $n$th **[[nLab:connecting homomorphism]]** of the short exact sequence, by sending

$$
  \delta_n : [c] \mapsto [\partial^B \hat c]_A
  \,,
$$

where 

1. $c \in Z_n(C)$ is a [[nLab:cycle]] representing the given [[nLab:homology group]] $[c]$; 

1. $\hat c \in C_n(B)$ is any lift of that cycle to an element in $B_n$, which exists because $p$ is a [[nLab:surjection]] (but which no longer needs to be a cycle itself);

1. $[\partial^B \hat c]_A$ is the $A$-homology class of $\partial^B \hat c$  which is indeed in $A_{n-1} \hookrightarrow B_{n-1}$ by exactness (since $p(\partial^B \hat c) = \partial^C p(\hat c) = \partial^C c = 0$) and indeed in $Z_{n-1}(A) \hookrightarrow A_{n-1}$ since $\partial^A \partial^B \hat c = \partial^B \partial^B \hat c = 0$.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Def. \ref{ConnectingForHomologyInComponents} is indeed well defined in that 
the given map is independent of the choice of lift $\hat c$ involved and in that the group structure is respected.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that the construction is well-defined, let $\tilde c \in B_{n}$ be another lift. Then $p(\hat c - \tilde c) = 0$ and hence 
$\hat c - \tilde c \in A_n \hookrightarrow B_n$.
This exhibits a homology-equivalence $[\partial^B\hat c]_A \simeq [\partial^B \tilde c]_A$ since
$
  \partial^A(\hat c - \tilde c) 
  = 
  \partial^B \hat c - \partial^B \tilde c$.


To see that $\delta_n$ is a group homomorphism, let $[c] = [c_1] + [c_2]$ be a sum. Then $\hat c \coloneqq \hat c_1 + \hat c_2$ is a lift and by linearity of $\partial$ we have $[\partial^B \hat c]_A = [\partial^B \hat c_1] + [\partial^B \hat c_2]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyLongExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Under [[nLab:chain homology]] $H_\bullet(-)$ the morphisms in the short exact sequence together with the [[nLab:connecting homomorphisms]] yield the **[[nLab:homology long exact sequence]]**

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  H_n(A) \to H_n(B) \to H_n(C) 
   \stackrel{\delta_n}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(B) \to H_{n-1}(C)   
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider first the exactness of $H_n(A) \stackrel{H_n(i)}{\to} H_n(B) 
\stackrel{H_n(p)}{\to} H_n(C)$.

It is clear that if $a \in Z_n(A) \hookrightarrow Z_n(B)$ then the image of $[a] \in H_n(B)$ is $[p(a)] = 0 \in H_n(C)$.
Conversely, an element $[b] \in H_n(B)$ is in the kernel of $H_n(p)$ if there is $c \in C_{n+1}$ with $\partial^C c = p(b)$. Since $p$ is surjective let $\hat c \in B_{n+1}$ be any lift, then $[b] =  [b - \partial^B \hat c]$ but $p(b - \partial^B c) = 0$ hence by exactness $b - \partial^B \hat c \in Z_n(A) \hookrightarrow Z_n(B)$ and so $[b]$ is in the image of $H_n(A) \to H_n(B)$. 


It remains to see that

1. the [[nLab:image]] of $H_n(B) \to H_n(C)$ is the [[nLab:kernel]] of $\delta_n$;

1. the [[nLab:kernel]] of $H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(B)$ is the [[nLab:image]] of $\delta_n$.

This follows by inspection of the formula in def. \ref{ConnectingForHomologyInComponents}. We spell out the first one:

If $[c]$ is in the image of $H_n(B) \to H_n(C)$ we have a lift $\hat c$ with $\partial^B \hat c = 0$ and so $\delta_n[c] = [\partial^B \hat c]_A  = 0$. Conversely, if for a given lift $\hat c$ we have that $[\partial^B \hat c]_A = 0$ this means there is $a \in A_n$ such that $\partial^A a \coloneqq \partial^B a = \partial^B \hat c$. But then $\tilde c \coloneqq \hat c - a$ is another possible lift of $c$ for which $\partial^B \tilde c = 0$ and so $[c]$ is in the image of $H_n(B) \to H_n(C)$.

###### Example

The [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]] of the [[nLab:long exact sequence in homology]] induced from short exact sequences of the form in example \ref{MultiplicationAndCyclicGroup} is called a _[[nLab:Bockstein homomorphism]]_.

=--

We now discuss a deeper, more conceptual way of understanding the origin of long exact sequences in homology and the nature of connecting homomorphisms. This will give first occasion to see some actual [[nLab:homotopy theory]] of chain complexes at work, and hence serves also as a motivating example for the discussions to follow in [chapter III)](#AbelianHomotopyTheory). 

For this we need the notion of _[[nLab:chain homotopy]]_, which is the abelianized analog of the notion of _[[nLab:homotopy]]_ of continuous maps above in def. \ref{LeftHomotopyContinousMaps}. We now first introduce this concept by straightforwardly mimicking the construction in def. \ref{LeftHomotopyContinousMaps} with topological spaces replaced by chain complexes. Then we use chain homotopies to construct [[nLab:mapping cones]] of [[nLab:chain maps]]. Finally we explain how these refine the above long exact sequences in homology groups to _[[nLab:homotopy cofiber sequences]]_ of the chain complexes themselves.


A _chain homotopy_ is a [[nLab:homotopy]] in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$. We first give the explicit definition, the more abstract characterization is below in prop. \ref{AsALeftHomotopy}.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _chain homotopy_ $\psi : f \Rightarrow g$ between two [[nLab:chain maps]] $f,g : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$ in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is a sequence of morphisms

$$
  \{ (\psi_n : C_n \to D_{n+1}) \in \mathcal{A} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

in $\mathcal{A}$ such that 

$$
  f_n - g_n = \partial^D \circ  \psi_n + \psi_{n-1} \partial^C
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

It may be useful to illustrate this with the following graphics, which however is _not_ a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]:

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1} - g_{n+1}}{\to}& D_{n+1}

Instead, a way to encode chain homotopies by genuine diagrammatics is below in prop. \ref{AsALeftHomotopy}, for which we introduce the _interval object_ for chain complexes:

+-- {: .num_defn #NormalizedChainInterval}
###### Definition

Let 

$$
  I_\bullet \coloneqq N_\bullet(C(\Delta[1]))
$$

be the [[nLab:normalized chain complex]] in $\mathcal{A}$ of the [[nLab:chain on a simplicial set|simplicial chains]] on the simplicial 1-[[nLab:simplex]]:

$$
  I_\bullet = 
  [
    \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to R \stackrel{(-id,id)}{\to}
   R \oplus R
  ]
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This is the standard _[[nLab:interval in chain complexes]]_. Indeed it is manifestly the "abelianization" of the standard interval object $\Delta^1$ in [[nLab:sSet]]/[[nLab:Top]]: the 1-[[nLab:simplex]].

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #AsALeftHomotopy}
###### Proposition

A chain homotopy $\psi : f \Rightarrow g$ is equivalently a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    C_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    I_\bullet \otimes C_\bullet 
    &\stackrel{(f,g,\psi)}{\to}&
    D_\bullet
    \\
    \uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    C_\bullet
  }
$$

in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, hence a genuine [[nLab:left homotopy]] with respect to the [[nLab:interval object in chain complexes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For notational simplicity we discuss this in $\mathcal{A} = $ [[nLab:Ab]].

Observe that $N_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}(\Delta[1]))$ is the chain complex

$$
  (  \cdots  \to 0   \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{(-id,id)}{\to}  \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots)
$$

where the term $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ is in degree 0: this is the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the set $\{(0),(1)\}$ of 0-simplices in $\Delta[1]$. The other copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ is the free abelian group on the single non-degenerate edge $(0 \to 1)$ in $\Delta[1]$. (All other [[nLab:simplices]] of $\Delta[1]$ are degenerate and hence do not contribute to the [[nLab:normalized chain complex]] which we are discussing here.) The single nontrivial [[nLab:differential]] sends $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ to 
$(-1,1) \in \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, reflecting the fact that one of the vertices is the 0-[[nLab:boundary]] the other the 1-boundary of the single nontrivial edge.

It follows that the [[nLab:tensor product of chain complexes]] 
$I_\bullet \otimes C_\bullet $ is

$$
  \array{
  && (I \otimes C)_2 &\to& (I \otimes C)_1 &\to& (I \otimes C)_0 &\to& \cdots
  \\
  \cdots
  &\to& 
  C_1 \oplus C_{2} \oplus C_2
  &\to& 
  C_0 \oplus C_{1} \oplus C_{1} 
  &\to&  
  C_{-1} \oplus C_0 \oplus C_0 
  &\to& \cdots
  }
 \,.
$$

Therefore a chain map $(f,g,\psi) :  I_\bullet \otimes C_\bullet  \to D_\bullet$ that restricted to the two copies of $C_\bullet$ is $f$ and $g$, respectively,  is characterized by a collection of commuting diagrams

$$
  \array{
    C_{n+1}\oplus C_{n+1} \oplus C_{n} 
      &\stackrel{(f_{n+1},g_{n+1}, \psi_n)}{\to}& D_n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\partial^{I \otimes C}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^D}}
    \\
     C_{n} \oplus C_{n} \oplus C_{n-1} &\stackrel{(f_n,g_n,\psi_{n-1})}{\to}
    & 
    D_{n-1}
  }
  \,.
$$

On the elements $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,0)$ in the top left this reduces to the chain map condition for $f$ and $g$, respectively. On the element $(0,0,1)$ this is the equation for the chain homotopy

$$
  f_n - g_n - \psi_{n-1} d_C = d_D \psi_{n}

Beware, as we will discuss in detail below in [8)](#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors), that another category that would deserve to  carry this name instead is called the _[[nLab:derived category]]_ of $\mathcal{A}$.
In the derived category one also quotients out chain homotopy, but one allows that first the [[nLab:domain]] of the two chain maps $f$ and $g$ is refined along a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]].

$$
  H_n(f) \colon H_n(C) \to H_n(D)

Quasi-isomorphisms are also called, more descriptively, **homology isomorphisms** or **$H_\bullet$-isomorphisms**.  See at _[[nLab:homology localization]]_ for more on this.

=--



With the homotopy theoretic notions of [[nLab:chain homotopy]] and [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]] in hand, we can now give a deeper explanation of long exact sequences in homology. We first give now a heuristic discussion that means to serve as a guide through the constructions to follow. The reader wishing to skip this may directly jump ahead to definition \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma}.


While the notion of a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]] is very useful for computations, it does not have invariant meaning if one considers chain complexes as objects in (abelian) [[nLab:homotopy theory]], where one takes into account [[nLab:chain homotopies]] between [[nLab:chain maps]] and takes [[nLab:equivalence]] of chain complexes not to be given by [[nLab:isomorphism]], but by [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]].

For if a [[nLab:chain map]] $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is the degreewise [[nLab:kernel]] of a chain map $B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$, then if $\hat A_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A_\bullet$ is a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]] (for instance a [[nLab:projective resolution]] of $A_\bullet$) then of course the composite chain map $\hat A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is in general far from being the degreewise kernel of $C_\bullet$. Hence the notion of degreewise kernels of chain maps and hence that of short exact sequences is not meaningful in the homotopy theory of chain complexes in $\mathcal{A}$ (for instance: not in the [[nLab:derived category]] of $\mathcal{A}$).

That short exact sequences of chain complexes nevertheless play an important role in [[nLab:homological algebra]] is due to what might be called a "technical coincidence":

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$ is a 
[[nLab:short exact sequence]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]], then the [[nLab:commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
     A_\bullet &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow

$$

is not only a [[nLab:pullback]] square in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, exhibiting $A_\bullet$ as the [[nLab:fiber]] of $B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$ over $0 \in C_\bullet$, it is in fact also a _[[nLab:homotopy pullback]]_.

=--

This means it is [[nLab:universal property|universal]] not just among commuting such squares, but also among such squares which commute possibly only up to a [[nLab:chain homotopy]] $\phi$:

$$
  \array{
     Q_\bullet &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow_{\phi}& \downarrow
     \\
     B_\bullet &\to& C_\bullet
  }
$$

and with morphisms between such squares being maps $A_\bullet \to A'_\bullet$ correspondingly with further chain homotopies filling all diagrams in sight.


Equivalently, we have the formally dual result

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$ is a 
[[nLab:short exact sequence]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]], then the [[nLab:commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
     A_\bullet &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     B_\bullet &\to& C_\bullet
  }
$$

is not only a [[nLab:pushout]] square in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, exhibiting $C_\bullet$ as the [[nLab:cofiber]] of $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ over $0 \in C_\bullet$, it is in fact also a _[[nLab:homotopy pushout]]_.

=--

But a central difference between [[nLab:fibers]]/[[nLab:cofibers]] on the one hand and [[nLab:homotopy fibers]]/[[nLab:homotopy cofibers]] on the other is that while the (co)fiber of a (co)fiber is necessarily trivial, the homotopy (co)fiber of a homotopy (co)fiber is in general far from trivial: it is instead the [[nLab:looping]] $\Omega(-)$  or [[nLab:suspension]] $\Sigma(-)$ of the codomain/domain of the original morphism: by the [[nLab:pasting law]] for homotopy pullbacks the [[nLab:pasting]] composite of successive [[nLab:homotopy cofibers]] of a given morphism $f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ looks like this:

$$
  \array{
     A_\bullet &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B_\bullet &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{\phi}}& \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& cone(f) &\to& A[1]_{\bullet} &\stackrel{}{\to}& 0
     \\
     && \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f[1]}}  &\swArrow& \downarrow
     \\
     && 0 &\to& B[1] &\to& cone(f)[1]_\bullet &\to& \cdots
     \\
     && && \downarrow && \downarrow &\ddots&
     \\
     && && \vdots && && 
  }
$$ 

here

* $cone(f)$ is a specific representative of the [[nLab:homotopy cofiber]] of $f$ called the _[[nLab:mapping cone]]_ of $f$, whose construction comes with an explicit [[nLab:chain homotopy]] $\phi$ as indicated, hence $cone(f)$ is homology-equivalence to $C_\bullet$ above, but is in general a "bigger" model of the homotopy cofiber;

* $A[1]$ etc. is the [[nLab:suspension of a chain complex]] of $A$, hence the same chain complex but pushed up in degree by one.


In conclusion we get from every morphim of chain complexes a 
long **[[nLab:homotopy cofiber sequence]]**

$$
    \cdots 
  \to 
     A_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to}B_\bullet
  \stackrel{}{\to} 
  cone(f)
   \stackrel{}{\to}
  A[1]_\bullet
   \stackrel{f[1]}{\to}
  B[1]_\bullet
   \stackrel{}{\to}   
  cone(f)[1]_\bullet
   \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

And applying the [[nLab:chain homology]] functor to this yields the long exact sequence in chain homology which is traditionally said to be associated to the short exact sequence $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$.

In conclusion this means that it is not really the passage to homology groups which "makes a short exact sequence become long". It's rather that passing to homology groups is a shadow of passing to chain complexes regarded up to quasi-isomorphism, and _this_ is what makes every short exact sequence be realized as but a special presentation of a stage in a long [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequence]].

We give a precise account of this story in the next section.


##### Homotopy fiber sequences and mapping cones
 {#MappingCones}

We have seen in [4)](#HomotopyHomologyFiberSequence) the [[nLab:long exact sequence in homology]] implied by a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]], constructed by an elementary if somewhat un-illuminating formula for the [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]]. We ended [4)](#HomotopyHomologyFiberSequence) by sketching how this formula arises as the shadow under the homology functor of a _[[nLab:homotopy fiber sequence]]_ of chain complexes, constructed using _[[nLab:mapping cones]]_. This we now discuss in precise detail.

In the following we repeatedly mention that certain chain complexes are [[nLab:colimits]] of certain diagrams of chain complexes. The reader unfamiliar with colimits may simply ignore them and regard the given chain complex as arising by definition. However, even a vague intuitive understanding of the indicated colimits as formalizations of "gluing" of chain complexes along certain maps should help to motivate why these definitions are what they are. The reader unhappy even with this can jump ahead to prop. \ref{CylinderOverAChainComplex} and take this and the following propositions up to and including prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes} as definitions.


The notion of a [[nLab:mapping cone]] that we introduce now is something that makes sense whenever 

1. there is a notion of [[nLab:cylinder object]], such as the topological cylinder $[0,1] \times X$ over a [[nLab:topological space]], or the chain complex cylinder $I_\bullet \otimes X_\bullet$ of a chain complex from def. \ref{NormalizedChainInterval}.

1. there is a way to _glue_ objects along maps between them, a notion of [[nLab:colimit]].

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma}
###### Definition

For $f : X \to Y$ a morphism in a category with [[nLab:cylinder objects]] $cyl(-)$, the **[[nLab:mapping cone]]** or **[[nLab:homotopy cofiber]]** of $f$ is the [[nLab:colimit]] in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && &\searrow & \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& &\to& cone(f) 
  }
$$

in $C$ using any [[nLab:cylinder object]] $cyl(X)$ for $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #GeometryOfMappingCone}
###### Remark

Heuristically this says that $cone(f)$ is the object obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. gluing to one end of that the object $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Heuristically it is clear that this way every [[nLab:cycle]] in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be "continuously" translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it becomes the point. This means that every [[nLab:homotopy group]] of $Y$ in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping cone **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it clear how $cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[nLab:cokernel]] of $f$. And therefore the name "mapping cone".

=--

Another interpretation of the mapping cone is just as important:

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A morphism $\eta : cyl(X) \to Y$ out of a [[nLab:cylinder object]] is a [[nLab:left homotopy]] $\eta : g \Rightarrow h$ between its restrictions $g\coloneqq \eta(0)$ and $h \coloneqq \eta(1)$ to the cylinder boundaries

$$
  \array{
     X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_0}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     cyl(X) &\stackrel{\eta}{\to}& Y
     \\
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{h}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} says that 
the mapping cone is the [[nLab:universal property|universal]] object with a morphism $i$ from $Y$ and a [[nLab:left homotopy]] from $i \circ f$ to the [[nLab:zero morphism]]. 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& cone(f)
  }
$$

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

This colimit, in turn, may be computed in two stages by two consecutive [[nLab:pushouts]] in $C$, and in two ways by the following [[nLab:pasting diagram]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{i_1} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X) &\to & cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& cone(X) &\to& cone(f) 
  }
  \,.
$$

Here every square is a [[nLab:pushout]], (and so by the [[nLab:pasting law]] is every rectangular pasting composite).

=--

This now is a basic fact in ordinary [[nLab:category theory]]. The pushouts appearing here go by the following names:

+-- {: .num_defn #CylindersAndCones}
###### Definition

The pushout

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& cone(X)
  }
$$

defines the **[[nLab:cone]]** $cone(X)$ over $X$ (with respect to the chosen [[nLab:cylinder object]]): the result of taking the [[nLab:cylinder object|cylinder]] over $X$ and identifying one $X$-shaped end with the [[nLab:point]].

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cyl(X) &\to& cyl(f)
  }
$$

defines the **[[nLab:mapping cylinder]]** $cyl(f)$ of $f$, the result of identifying one end of the cylinder over $X$ with $Y$, using $f$ as the gluing map.

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    cyl(x) &\to& cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cone(X) &\to& cone(f)
  }
$$

defines the **mapping cone** $cone(f)$ of $f$: the result of forming the cyclinder over $X$ and then identifying one end with the point and the other with $Y$, via $f$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

As in remark \ref{GeometryOfMappingCone} all these step have evident heuristic geometric interpretations:

1. $cone(X)$ is obtained from the cylinder over $X$ by contracting one end of the cylinder to the point;

1. $cyl(f)$ is obtained from the cylinder over $X$ by gluing $Y$ to one end of the cylinder, as specified by the map $f$;

We discuss now this general construction of the mapping cone $cone(f)$ for a [[nLab:chain map]] $f$ between [[nLab:chain complexes]].

This defines the mapping cone construction on chain complex. Its definition as a universal left homotopy should make the following proposition at least plausible, which we cannot prove yet at this point, but which we state nevertheless to highlight the meaning of the mapping cone construction.

$i : Y_\bullet \to cone(f)_\bullet$.

By prop. \ref{InclusionIntoChainComplexCone} and

$$
  Y_\bullet 
    \stackrel{i}{\to}
  cone(f)_\bullet
    \stackrel{p}{\to}
  X[1]_\bullet
$$

is a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] of chain complexes (since it is so degreewise, in fact degreewise it is even a [[nLab:split exact sequence]], def. \ref{SplitnessInAbelianCategory}). In particular we have a [[nLab:cofiber]] [[nLab:pushout]] diagram

$$

Now, in the [[nLab:injective model structure on chain complexes]] all chain complexes are [[nLab:cofibrant objects]] and an inclusion such as $i : Y_\bullet \hookrightarrow cone(f)_\bullet$ is a [[nLab:cofibration]]. By the detailed discussion at [[nLab:homotopy limit]] this means that the ordinary colimit here is in fact a [[nLab:homotopy colimit]], hence exhibits $p$ as the [[nLab:homotopy cofiber]] of $i$.

In order to compare this to the discussion of [[nLab:connecting homomorphisms]], we now turn attention to the case that $f_\bullet$ happens to be a [[nLab:monomorphism]].  Notice that this we can always assume, up to [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]], for instance by prolonging $f$ by the map into its [[nLab:mapping cylinder]]

$$
  X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} cyl(f)

By the axioms on an [[nLab:abelian category]] in this case we have a [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X_\bullet \stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to} Y_\bullet \stackrel{p_\bullet}{\to} Z_\bullet \to 0
$$

of chain complexes. The following discussion revolves around the fact that now $cone(f)_\bullet$ as well as $Z_\bullet$ are both models for the homotopy cofiber of $f$.

and use that $x_{n-1}$ is in the [[nLab:kernel]] of $p_n$ by exactness, hence

$$

    & = \partial^Z p_n \hat z_n
    \\
    & = \partial^Z h_n(x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

It is immediate to see that we have a [[nLab:commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && cone(f)_\bullet 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i_\bullet}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\to& Z_\bullet
  }
$$

since the composite morphism is the inclusion of $Y$ followed by the bottom morphism on $Y$. 

Abstractly, this already implies that $cone(f)_\bullet \to Z_\bullet$ is a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]], 
for this diagram gives a morphism of [[nLab:cocones]] under the diagram defining $cone(f)$ in prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} and by the above both of these cocones are [[nLab:homotopy colimit|homotopy-colimiting]].

But in checking the claimed inverse of the induced map on homology groups, we verify this also explicity:

We first determine those cycles $(x_{n-1}, y_n) \in cone(f)_n$ which lift a cycle $z_n$. By lemma \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma}
a lift of chains is any pair of the form $(x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)$ where $\hat z_n$ is a lift of $z_n$ through $Y_n \to X_n$. So $x_{n-1}$ has to be found such that this pair is a cycle.
By prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes} the differential acts on it by

$$
  \partial^{cone(f)} (x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
  = 
  (  -\partial^X x_{n-1} , \partial^Y \hat z_n + x_{n-1} )
$$

and so the condition is that 

$x_{n-1} \coloneqq -\partial^Y \hat z_n$ (which implies $\partial^X x_{n-1} = -\partial^X \partial^Y \hat z_n = -\partial^Y \partial^Y \hat z_n = 0$ due to the fact that $f_n$ is assumed to be an inclusion, hence that $\partial^X$ is the restriction of $\partial^Y$ to elements in $X_n$).

This condition clearly has a unique solution for every lift $\hat z_n$ and a lift $\hat z_n$ always exists since $p_n : Y_n \to Z_n$ is surjective, by assumption that we have a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] of chain complexes. This shows that $H_n(h_\bullet)$ is surjective.

To see that it is also injective we need to show that 
if a [[nLab:cycle]] $(-\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n) \in cone(f)_n$ maps to a cycle $z_n = p_n(\hat z_n)$ that is trivial in $H_n(Z)$ in that there is $c_{n+1}$ with $\partial^Z c_{n+1} = z_n$, then also the original cycle was trivial in homology, in that there is $(x_n, y_{n+1})$ with

$$
  \partial^{cone(f)}(x_n, y_{n+1})
  \coloneqq
  (-\partial^X x_n, \partial^Y y_{n+1} + x_n)
  =
  (-\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n)
  \,.
$$

For that let $\hat c_{n+1} \in Y_{n+1}$ be a lift of $c_{n+1}$ through $p_n$, which exists again by surjectivity of $p_{n+1}$. Observe that

$$
  p_{n}( \hat z_n -  \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1})
  = 
  z_n -\partial^Z ( p_n \hat c_{n+1} )
  = 
  z_n - \partial^Z ( c_{n+1} ) 
  = 
  0
$$

by assumption on $z_n$ and $c_{n+1}$,
and hence that $\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}$ is in $X_n$ by exactness.

Hence 
$(z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}, \hat c_{n+1}) \in cone(f)_n$
trivializes the given cocycle:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{cone(f)}( \hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}  , \hat c_{n+1})
    & = 
   (-\partial^X(\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} ), \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} + (\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} ) )
    \\
    & = (-\partial^Y(\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}),  \hat z_n )
    \\
    & =
    ( -\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

###### Theorem

Let 
$$
  X_\bullet \stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to} Y_\bullet \to Z_\bullet
$$

be a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] of [[nLab:chain complexes]]. 

Then the  [[nLab:chain homology]] functor

$$
  H_n(-) : Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{A}
$$

sends the homotopy cofiber sequence of $f$, cor. \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequenceOfChainMap}, to the 
[[nLab:long exact sequence in homology]] induced by the given short
exact sequence, hence to

$$
  H_n(X_\bullet)
  \to
  H_n(Y_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_n(Z_\bullet)
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(X_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_{n-1}(Y_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_{n-1}(Z_\bullet)
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H_{n-2}(X_\bullet)
   \to \cdots
  \,,
$$

where $\delta_n$ is the $n$th [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{ConeInjectionEquivalentToZigzag} the 
homotopy cofiber sequence is equivalen to the [[nLab:zigzag]]

$$
  \array{
     && && && && && cone(f)[1]_\bullet &\to& \cdots
     \\
     && && && && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h[1]_\bullet}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     && && cone(f)_\bullet &\to& X[1]_\bullet &\stackrel{f[1]_\bullet}{\to}& Y[1]_\bullet &\to& Z[1]_\bullet
     \\
     && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_\bullet}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X_\bullet 
       &\stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to}&
     Y_\bullet
       &\stackrel{}{\to}&
     Z_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

Observe that 

$$
  H_n( X[k]_\bullet) \simeq H_{n-k}(X_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

It is therefore sufficient to check that 

$$
  H_n
  \left(
    \array{
      cone(f)_\bullet &\to& X[1]_\bullet
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
      \\
      Z_\bullet
    }
  \right)
  \;\;
   : 
  \;\;
  H_n(Z_\bullet) \to H_n(cone(f)_\bullet) \to H_{n-1}(X_\bullet)
$$

equals the [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]] $\delta_n$ induced by the short exact sequence.

By prop. \ref{ConeInjectionEquivalentToZigzag} the inverse of the vertical map is given by choosing lifts and forming the corresponding element given by the connecting homomorphism.
By prop. \ref{ProjectionOutOfChainComplexMappingConeIsHoCofiber} the horizontal map is just the projection, and hence the assignment is of the form

$$
  [z_n] \mapsto [x_{n-1}, y_n] \mapsto [x_{n-1}]
  \,.
$$

So in total the image of the zig-zag under homology sends

$$
  [z_n]_Z \mapsto -[\partial^Y \hat z_n]_X
  \,.
$$

By the discussion [there](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connecting%20homomorphism#OnHomologyInTermsOfElements), this is indeed the action of the [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]].

=--

**In summary**, the [above](#HomologyExactSequencesAndFiberSequences) says that for every [[nLab:chain map]] $f_\bullet : X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ we obtain maps

$$
  X_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to}
  Y_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
          0 
          \\
          id_{Y_\bullet}
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
   cone(f)_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
         id_{X[1]_\bullet} & 0
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
  X[1]_\bullet
$$

which form a [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequence]] and such that this sequence continues by forming [[nLab:suspension of a chain complex|suspensions]], hence for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have

$$
  X[n]_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to}
  Y[n]_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
          0 
          \\
          id_{Y[n]_\bullet}
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
   cone(f)[n]_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
         id_{X[n+11]_\bullet} & 0
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
  X[n+1]_\bullet
$$

To amplify this quasi-cyclic behaviour one sometimes depicts the situation as follows:

$$
  \array{
     X_\bullet &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& Y_\bullet
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{[1]}}\nwarrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && cone(f)_\bullet
  }
$$

and hence speaks of a "triangle", or **distinguished triangle** or **mapping cone triangle** of $f$. 

* [[nLab:distinguished triangle]] = period of [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequence]] .

Due to these "triangles" one calls the [[nLab:homotopy category]] of chain complexes [[nLab:localization|localized]] at the [[nLab:quasi-isomorphisms]], hence the  [[nLab:derived category]] which we discuss below in [8)](#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors), a **[[nLab:triangulated category]]**.



#####  Double complexes and the diagram chasing lemmas
 {#DoubleComplexesAndSalamander}

We have seen in the discussion of the [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]]
in the [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]] in  [4)](#HomotopyHomologyFiberSequence) above that given an _exact sequence of chain complexes_ -- hence in particular a chain complex of chain complexes -- there are interesting ways to relate elements on the far right to elements on the far left in lower degree. In [5)](#MappingCones) we had given the conceptual explanation of this phenomenon in terms of long [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequences]]. But often it is just computationally useful to be able to efficiently establish and compute these "long diagram chase"-relations, independently of a homotopy-theoretic interpretation. Such computational tools we discuss here.

A _chain complex of chain complex_ is called a _[[nLab:double complex]]_ and so we first introduce this elementary notion and the corresponding notion notion of [[nLab:total complex]]. (Total complexes are similarly elementary to define but will turn out to play a deeper role as models for [[nLab:homotopy colimits]], this we indicate further below in chapter [V)](#RelationToHomotopyTheory)).

There is a host of classical diagram-chasing lemmas that relate far-away entries in double complexes that enjoy suitable exactness properties. These go by names such as the _[[nLab:snake lemma]]_ or the _[[nLab:3x3 lemma]]_. The underlying mechanism of all these lemmas is made most transparent in the _[[nLab:salamander lemma]]_. This is fairly trivial to establish, and the notions it induces allow quick transparent proofs of all the other diagram-chasing lemmas.

> The discussion to go here is kept at **[[nLab:salamander lemma]]**. See there.




#### Kan complexes -- General homotopy types
 {#KanComplexes}

With [[groupoids]] and [[chain complexes]] we have seen two kinds of objects which support concepts of [[homotopy theory]], such as a concept of [[homotopy equivalence]] between them ([[equivalence of groupoids]] on the one hand, and [[quasi-isomorphism]]) on the other. In some sense these two cases are opposite extremes in the more general context of [[homotopy theory]]: 

* [[chain complexes]] have homotopical structure (e.g. [[chain homology]]) in arbitrary high degree, i.e. they may be [[homotopy n-types]] for arbitrary $n$, but they are fully _abelian_ in that there is never any [[nonabelian group]] structure in a chain complex, not is there any non-trivial [[action]] of the homology groups of a chain complex on each other;

* [[groupoids]] have more general non-abelian structure, for every ([[nonabelian group|nonabelian]]) [[group]] there is a groupoid which has this as its [[fundamental group]], but this fundamental group (in degree 1) is already the highest homotopical structure they carry, groupoids are necessarily [[homotopy 1-types]].

On the other hand, both groupoids and chain complexes naturally have incarnations in the joint context of _[[simplicial sets]]_. We now discuss how their common joint generalization is given by those simplicial sets whose simplices have a sensible notion of composition and inverses, the _[[Kan complexes]]_.


$$
  \array{
    && {topological \atop spaces} 
    \\
    &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{{higher \atop path}\atop groupoid}}
    & 
    \\
    groupoids 
      &\stackrel{{Grothendieck \atop nerve}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    { {\mathbf{Kan}\;\mathbf{complexes}} \atop {\simeq \infty-groupoids} }
      &\stackrel{{Dold-Kan \atop correspondence}}{\longleftarrow}&
    {chain \atop complexes}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{included \atop in}}
    \\
    && {simplicial \atop sets}
  }
$$

Kan complexes serve as a standard powerful model on wich the complete formulation of [[homotopy theory]] (without geometry) may be formulated. 

##### Intuitive idea -- Composition of higher order (gauge-)symmetries

An [[∞-groupoid]] is first of all supposed to be a structure that has [[k-morphism]]s for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, which for $k \geq 1$ go between $(k-1)$-morphisms. A useful tool for organizing such collections of morphisms is the notion of a [[simplicial set]]. This is a [[functor]] on the [[opposite category]] of the  [[simplex category]] $\Delta$, whose objects are the abstract cellular $k$-[[simplex|simplices]], denoted $[k]$ or $\Delta[k]$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and whose morphisms $\Delta[k_1] \to \Delta[k_2]$ are all ways of mapping these into each other. So we think of such a simplicial set given by a functor

$$
  K : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

as specifying

* a set $[0] \mapsto K_0$ of [[objects]];

* a set $[1] \mapsto K_1$ of [[morphisms]];

* a set $[2] \mapsto K_2$ of [[2-morphisms]];

* a set $[3] \mapsto K_3$ of [[3-morphisms]];

and generally

* a set $[k] \mapsto K_k$ of [[k-morphisms]]

as well as specifying

* functions $([n] \hookrightarrow [n+1]) \mapsto (K_{n+1} \to K_n)$
  that send $n+1$-morphisms to their boundary $n$-morphisms;

* functions $([n+1] \to [n]) \mapsto (K_{n} \to K_{n+1})$
  that send $n$-morphisms to [[identity]] $(n+1)$-morphisms
  on them.

The fact that $K$ is supposed to be a [[functor]] enforces that these assignments of sets and functions satisfy conditions that make consistent our interpretation of them as sets of $k$-morphisms and source and target maps between these. 
These are called the [[simplicial identities]].

But apart from this source-target matching, a generic simplicial set does not yet encode a notion of [[composition]] of these morphisms. 

For instance for $\Lambda^1[2]$ the simplicial set consisting of two attached 1-cells 

$$
  \Lambda^1[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

and for $(f,g) : \Lambda^1[2] \to K$ an image of this situation in $K$, hence a pair $x_0 \stackrel{f}{\to} x_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} x_2$ of two _composable_ 1-morphisms in $K$, we want to demand that there exists a third 1-morphisms in $K$ that may be thought of as the [[composition]] $x_0 \stackrel{h}{\to} x_2$ of $f$ and $g$. But since we are working in [[higher category theory]] (and not to be [[evil]]), we want to identify this composite only up to a [[2-morphism]] equivalence

$$
    \array{
       && x_1
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}& 
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       x_0 &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& x_2
    }
  \,.
$$

From the picture it is clear that this is equivalent to demanding that for $\Lambda^1[2] \hookrightarrow \Delta[2]$ the obvious inclusion of the two abstract composable 1-morphisms into the 2-simplex we have a diagram of morphisms of simplicial sets

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^1[2] &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists h}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

A simplicial set where for all such $(f,g)$ a corresponding such $h$ exists may be thought of as a collection of higher morphisms that is equipped with a notion of composition of adjacent 1-morphisms. 

For the purpose of describing [[groupoid]]al composition, we now want that this composition operation has all [[inverse]]s. For that purpose, notice that for 

$$
  \Lambda^2[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&\to&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

the simplicial set consisting of two 1-morphisms that touch at their end, hence for 

$$
  (g,h) : \Lambda^2[2] \to K
$$

two such 1-morphisms in $K$, then if $g$ had an inverse $g^{-1}$ we could use the above composition operation to compose that with $h$ and thereby find a morphism $f$ connecting the sources of $h$ and $g$. This being the case is evidently equivalent to the existence of diagrams of morphisms of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^2[2] &\stackrel{(g,h)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists f}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

Demanding that all such diagrams exist is therefore demanding that we have on 1-morphisms a composition operation with inverses in $K$. 

In order for this to qualify as an $\infty$-groupoid, this composition operation needs to satisfy an [[associativity law]] up to [[coherent]] [[2-morphism]]s, which means that we can find the relevant [[tetrahedra]]s in $K$. These in turn need to be connected by _pentagonators_ and ever so on.  It is a nontrivial but true and powerful fact, that all these [[coherence]] conditions are captured by generalizing the above conditions to all dimensions in the evident way:

let $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ be the simplicial set -- called the $i$th $n$-[[horn]] -- that consists of all cells of the $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$ except the interior $n$-morphism and the $i$th $(n-1)$-morphism.

Then a simplicial set is called a [[Kan complex]], if for all images $f : \Lambda^i[n] \to K$ of such horns in $K$, the missing two cells can be found in $K$- in that we can always find a _horn filler_ $\sigma$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^i[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& K
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\sigma}}
     \\
     \Delta[n]
  }
  \,.
$$

The basic example is the [[nerve]] $N(C) \in sSet$ of an ordinary [[groupoid]] $C$, which is the [[simplicial set]] with $N(C)_k$ being the set of sequences of $k$ composable morphisms in $C$. The nerve operation is a [[full and faithful functor]]  from 1-groupoids into Kan complexes and hence may be thought of as embedding 1-groupoids in the context of general [[∞-groupoids]].

##### Definition 

Recall the definition of [[simplicial sets]] from [above](#SingularSimplicialSet). Let 

$$
  \Delta[n] = \mathbf{\Delta}( -, [n]) \in  Simp Set
$$

be the standard simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] in [[SimpSet]].

###### Definition

For each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, the **$(n,i)$-horn** or **$(n,i)$-box** 
is the subsimplicial set 

$$
  \Lambda^i[n]
  \hookrightarrow
  \Delta[n] 
$$

which is the [[union]] of all faces _except_ the  $i^{th}$ one.

This is called an **outer horn** if $k = 0$ or $k = n$.  Otherwise it is an **inner horn**.

###### Remark


Since [[sSet]]  is a [[presheaf topos]], [[unions]] of [[subobjects]] make sense and they are calculated objectwise, thus in this case dimensionwise.  This way it becomes clear what the structure of a horn as a functor $\Lambda^k[n]: \Delta^{op} \to Set$ must therefore be: it takes $[m]$ to the collection of ordinal maps $f: [m] \to [n]$ which do not have the element $k$ in the image.

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ a [[groupoid]], def. \ref{Groupoid}, 
its _[[simplicial nerve]]_ $N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)_\bullet$ is 
the [[simplicial set]] with 

$$
  N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)_n \coloneqq \mathcal{G}_1^{\times_{\mathcal{G}_0}^n}
$$ 

the set of sequences of composable morphisms of length $n$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

with face maps

$$
  d_k \colon N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)_{n+1} \to N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)_{n}
$$

being, 

* for $n = 0$ the functions that remembers the $k$th object;

* for $n \geq 1$ 

  * the two outer face maps $d_0$ and $d_n$ are given by forgetting the first and the last morphism in such a sequence, respectively; 

  * the $n-1$ inner face maps $d_{0 \lt k \lt n}$ are given by composing the $k$th morphism with the $k+1$st in the sequence.

The degeneracy maps

$$
  s_k \colon N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)n \to N(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

are given by inserting an [[identity]] morphism on $x_k$.

###### Remark

Spelling this out in more detail: write

$$
  \mathcal{G}_n = 
  \left\{
    x_0

    x_1

for the set of sequences of $n$ composable morphisms. Given any element of 
this set and $0 \lt k \lt n $, write 

$$
  f_{i-1,i+1} \coloneqq f_{i,i+1} \circ f_{i-1,i}
$$

for the comosition of the two morphism that share the $i$th vertex. 

With this, face map $d_k$ acts simply by "removing the index $k$":

$$
  d_0
  \colon 
  (x_0 \stackrel{f_{0,1}}{\to}  x_1 \stackrel{f_{1,2}}{\to} x_{2} \cdots \stackrel{f_{n-1,n}}{\to} x_n )

$$
  d_n

  (
    x_0 \stackrel{f_{0,1}}{\to}

$$


Similarly, writing

$$
  f_{k,k} \coloneqq id_{x_k}
$$

for the identity morphism on the object $x_k$, 
then the degenarcy map acts by
"repeating the $k$th index"

$$
  s_k
  \colon
  (
    x_0 \stackrel{}{\to}
    \cdots

    x_{k+1}

  (
    x_0 \stackrel{}{\to}

    x_k
     \stackrel{f_{k,k}}{\to}
    x_k
    \stackrel{f_{k,k+1}}{\to}
    x_{k+1}

##### Chain complexes as Kan complexes -- Dold-Kan-Moore correspondence
 {#DoldKanCorrespondence}

In the familiar construction of [[singular homology]] recalled [above](#SimplicialHomology) one constructs the _alternating face map chain complex_ of the [[simplicial abelian group]] of singular simplices, def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}. This construction is natural and straightforward, but the result chain complex tends to be very "large" even if its [[chain homology groups]] end up being very "small". But in the context of [[homotopy theory]] one is to consider all objects notup to [[isomorphism]], but of to [[weak equivalence]], which for [[chain complexes]] means up to _[[quasi-isomorphisms]]_. Hence one should look for the natural construction of "smaller" chain complexes that are still quasi-isomorphic to these alternating face map complexes. This is accomplished by the [[normalized chain complex]] construction:

By theorem \ref{EMTheorem} the vertical map is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] and by prop. \ref{NormalizedIntoModuloDegeneraciesIsIsomorpism} the composite diagonal map is an [[isomorphism]], hence in particular also a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. Since quasi-isomorphisms satisfy the [[two-out-of-three]] property, it follows that also the map in question is a quasi-isomorphism.

+-- {: .num_example #ChainsOnThe1Simplex}
###### Example

Consider the 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta[1]$ regarded as a [[simplicial set]], and write $\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]$ for the [[simplicial abelian group]] which in each degree is the [[free abelian group]] on the simplices in $\Delta[1]$.

This simplicial abelian group starts out as

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]
  =
  \left(
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
     \mathbb{Z}^4 \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
     \mathbb{Z}^3 \stackrel{\overset{\partial_0}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\partial_1}{\longrightarrow}} \mathbb{Z}^2
  \right)
$$

(where we are indicating only the face maps for notational simplicity).

Here the first $\mathbb{Z}^2 = \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}$, the [[direct sum]] of two copies of the [[integers]], is the group of 0-chains generated from the two endpoints $(0)$ and $(1)$ of $\Delta[1]$, i.e. the abelian group of formal linear combinations of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z}^2 \simeq \left\{ a \cdot (0) + b \cdot (1) | a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
  \,.
$$

The second $\mathbb{Z}^3 \simeq \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}$ is the abelian group generated from the three (!) 1-simplicies in $\Delta[1]$, namely the non-degenerate edge $(0\to 1)$ and the two degenerate cells $(0 \to 0)$ and $(1 \to 1)$, hence the abelian group of formal linear combinations of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z}^3 \simeq \left\{ a \cdot (0\to 0) + b \cdot (0 \to 1) + c \cdot (1 \to 1) | a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
  \,.
$$

The two face maps act on the basis 1-cells as

$$
  \partial_1 \colon (i \to j) \mapsto (i)
$$

$$
  \partial_0 \colon (i \to j) \mapsto (j)
  \,.
$$

Now of course most of the (infinitely!) many simplices inside $\Delta[1]$ are degenerate. In fact the only non-degenerate simplices are the two 0-cells $(0)$ and $(1)$ and the 1-cell $(0 \to 1)$. Hence the alternating face maps complex modulo degeneracies, def. \ref{ComplexModuloDegeneracies}, of $\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]$ is simply this:

$$
  (C (\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]])) / D (\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]))
  =
  \left(
    \cdots
    \to
    0
    \to
    0
    \to
    \mathbb{Z}
    \stackrel{\left(1 \atop -1\right)}{\longrightarrow}
    \mathbb{Z}^2
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice that alternatively we could consider the topological 1-simplex $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$ and its [[singular simplicial complex]] $Sing(\Delta^1)$ in place of the smaller $\Delta[1]$, then the free simplicial abelian group $\mathbb{Z}(Sing(\Delta^1))$ of that. The corresponding alternating face map chain complex $C(\mathbb{Z}(Sing(\Delta^1)))$ is "huge" in that in each positive degree it has a free abelian group on uncountably many generators. Quotienting out the degenerate cells still leaves uncountably many generators in each positive degree (while every singular $n$-simplex in $[0,1]$ is "thin", only those whose parameterization is as induced by a degeneracy map are actually regarded as degenerate cells here). Hence even after normalization the singular simplicial chain complex is "huge". Nevertheless it is quasi-isomorphic to the tiny chain complex found above.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

With the explicit choice for $\Gamma N \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Id$ as [above](#ExplicitUnitAndCounit) we have that $\Gamma$ and $N$ form an [[adjoint equivalence]] $(\Gamma \dashv N)$

This is for instance ([Weibel, exercise 8.4.2](Dold-Kan+correspondence#Weilbel)).

It follows that with the inverse structure maps, we also have an [[adjunction]] the other way round: $(N \dashv \Gamma)$.

Hence in concclusion the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] allows us to regard [[chain complexes]] (in non-negative degree) as, in particular, special [[simplicial sets]]. In fact as simplicial sets they are [[Kan complexes]] and hence [[infinity-groupoids]]:


+-- {: .num_theorem #MooreTheorem}
###### Theorem (J. C. Moore)

The [[simplicial set]] underlying any [[simplicial group]]
(by forgetting the group structure) is a [[Kan complex]].

=--

This is due to ([Moore, 1954](simplicial+group#Moore54))

In fact, not only are the [[horn]] fillers guaranteed to exist, but there is an algorithm that provides explicit fillers.  This implies that constructions on a simplicial group that use fillers of horns can often be adjusted to be functorial by using the algorithmically defined fillers.  An argument that just uses 'existence' of fillers can be refined to give something more 'coherent'.


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $G$ be a simplicial group. 

Here is the explicit algorithm that computes the horn fillers:

Let $(y_0,\ldots, y_{k-1}, -,y_{k+1}, \ldots, y_n)$ give a [[horn]] in $G_{n-1}$, so the $y_i$s are $(n-1)$ simplices that fit together as if they were all but one, the $k^{th}$ one,  of the faces of an $n$-simplex. There are three cases: 

1. if $k = 0$: 

   * Let  $w_n = s_{n-1}y_n$ and then $w_i = w_{i+1}(s_{i-1}d_i w_{i+1})^{-1}s_{i-1}y_i$ for  $i = n, \ldots, 1$, then  $w_1 $ satisfies $d_i w_1 = y_i$, $i\neq  0$;

1. if $0\lt k \lt n$: 

   * Let $w_0 = s_0 y_0$ and $w_i = w_{i-1}(s_i d_i w_{i-1})^{-1}s_i y_i$ for $i = 0, \ldots, k-1$, then take $w_n = w_{k-1}(s_{n-1}d_nw_{k-1})^{-1}s_{n-1}y_n$, and finally a downwards induction given by $w_i = w_{i+1}(s_{i-1}d_{i}w_{i+1})^{-1}s_{i-1}y_i$, for $i = n, \ldots, k+1$, then $w_{k+1}$ gives $d_{i}w_{k+1} = y_i$ for $i \neq k$;


3. if $k=n$: 

   * use $w_0 = s_0 y_0$ and $w_i = w_{i-1}(s_i d_i w_{i-1})^{-1}s_i y_i$ for $i = 0, \ldots, n-1$, then $w_{n-1}$ satisfies $d_i w_{n-1} = y_i$, $i\neq n$.

#### Abelian homotopy theory
 {#AbelianHomotopyTheory}

We have seen in  _[Chain complexes -- Abelian homotopy types](#ChainComplexes)_ that the most interesting properties of the category of chain complexes is all secretly controled by the phenomenon of [[nLab:chain homotopy]] and [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]. Strictly speaking these two phenomena point beyond plain [[nLab:category theory]] to the richer context of general abstract _[[nLab:homotopy theory]]_. Here we discuss properties of the category of chain complexes from this genuine homotopy-theoretic point of view. The result of passing the category of chain complexes to genuine homotopy theory is called the [[nLab:derived category]] (of the underlying [[nLab:abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$, say of [[nLab:modules]]) and we start in [7)](#ChainHomotopyAndResolution) with a motivation of the phenomenon of this "homotopy derivation" and the discussion of the necessary _[[nLab:resolutions]]_ of chain complexes. This naturally gives rise to the general notion of [[nLab:derived functors]] which we discuss in [8)](#ExamplesOfDerivedFunctors). Examples of these are ubiquituous in [[nLab:homological algebra]], but as in ordinary [[nLab:enriched category theory]] two stand out as being of more fundamental importance, the derived functor "[[nLab:Ext]]" of the [[nLab:hom-functor]] and the derived functor "[[nLab:Tor]]" of the [[nLab:tensor product]] functor. Their properties and uses we discuss in [9)](#ExamplesOfDerivedFunctors).



##### Chain homotopy and resolutions
 {#ChainHomotopyAndResolution}

We now come back to the [[nLab:category]] $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A})$ of def. \ref{TheStrongHomotopyCategory}, the "[[nLab:homotopy category of chain complexes]]" in which chain-homotopic chain maps are identified. This would seem to be the right context to study the [[nLab:homotopy theory]] of chain complexes, but one finds that there are still chain maps which ought to be identified in [[nLab:homotopy theory]], but which are still not identified in $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A})$. This is our motivating example \ref{AChainMapThatOughtToBeNullHomotopicButIsNot} below. 

We discuss then how this problem is fixed by allowing to first "[[nLab:resolution|resolve]]" chain complexes [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphically]] by "good representatives" called _[[nLab:projective resolutions]]_ or _[[nLab:injective resolutions]]_. Many of the computations in the following sections -- and in homological algebra in general -- come down to operating on such resolutions. We end this section by prop. \ref{MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic} below, which shows that the above problem indeed goes away when allowing chain complexes to be resolved.

In the next section, [8)](#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors), we discuss how this process of forming resolutions functorially extends to the whole category of modules.


So we start here with this simple example that shows the problem with bare chain homotopies and indicates how these have to be _resolved_:

+-- {: .num_example #AChainMapThatOughtToBeNullHomotopicButIsNot}
###### Example

In $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for $\mathcal{A} = $ [[nLab:Ab]] consider the [[nLab:chain map]]

$$
  \array{
    \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{mod\,2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

The [[nLab:codomain]] of this map is an [[nLab:exact sequence]], hence is [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the 0-chain complex. Thereofore in [[nLab:homotopy theory]] it should behave entirely as the 0-complex itself. In particular, every [[nLab:chain map]] to it should be [[nLab:chain homotopy|chain homotopic]] to the [[nLab:zero morphism]] (have a _[[nLab:null homotopy]]_).

But the above chain map is chain homotopic precisely only to itself. This is because the degree-0 component of any chain homotopy out of this has to be a homomorphism of abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \mathbb{Z}$, and this must be the 0-morphism, because $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[nLab:free group]], but $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is not.

This points to the problem: the components of the domain chain complex are not _free enough_ to admit sufficiently many maps out of it. 

Consider therefore a [[nLab:free resolution]] of the above domain complex by the [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]

$$
  \array{
     \cdots 
    &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{mod\,2}}
    \\
    \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,,
$$

where now the domain complex consists entirely of [[nLab:free groups]]. 
The composite of this with the original chain map is now

$$
  \array{
     \cdots 
    &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{0} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{mod\,2}}
    \\
    \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{mod\,2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

This is the corresponding [[nLab:resolution]] of the original chain map. And _this_ indeed has a [[nLab:null homotopy]]: 

$$
  \array{
     \cdots 
    &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
    \\
      && 
    \downarrow 
     &\swarrow& 
    \downarrow 
      &\swarrow_{-id}& 
    \downarrow^{0} 
      &\swarrow_{\mathrlap{id}}& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{mod\,2}}
    \\
    \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{mod\,2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

So _resolving the domain by a sufficiently free complex_ makes otherwise missing chain homotopies exist.
Below in lemma \ref{MapsProjectiveIntoExactAreNullHomotopic} we discuss the general theory behind the kind of situation of this example. But to get there we first need some basic notions and facts.

Notably, in general it is awkward to insist on actual _free resolutions_. But it is easy to see, and this we discuss now, that essentially just as well is a resolution by modules which are [[nLab:direct sum|direct summands]] of [[nLab:free modules]].


+-- {: .num_defn #ProjectiveObject}
###### Definition

An [[nLab:object]] $P$ of a [[nLab:category]] $C$ is a **projective object**  if it has the [[nLab:left lifting property]] against [[nLab:epimorphisms]]. 

This means that $P$ is projective if for any [[nLab:morphism]] $f:P \to B$ and any [[nLab:epimorphism]] $q:A \to B$, $f$ factors through $q$ by some morphism $P\to A$.

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{q}} 
    \\
    P &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--


An equivalent way to say  this is that:


+-- {: .num_defn #ByCovHomPreservingEpis}
###### Definition

An object $P$ is projective precisely if the [[nLab:hom-functor]] $Hom(P,-)$ preserves [[nLab:epimorphisms]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The point of this [[nLab:lifting property]] will become clear when we discuss the construction of [[nLab:projective resolutions]] a bit further below: they are built by applying this property degreewise to obtain suitable chain maps.

=--

We will be interested in projective objects in the category $R$[[nLab:Mod]]: _[[nLab:projective modules]]_. Before we come to that, notice the following example (which the reader may on first sight feel is pedantic and irrelevant, but for the following it is actually good to make this explicit).

+-- {: .num_example #ProjectivesInSet}
###### Example

In the [[nLab:category]] [[nLab:Set]] of [[nLab:sets]] the following are equivalent

* every object is projective;

* the [[nLab:axiom of choice]] holds.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

We will assume here throughout the [[nLab:axiom of choice]] in [[nLab:Set]], as usual. The point of the above example, however, is that one could just as well replace [[nLab:Set]] by another "[[nLab:base topos]]" which will behave essentially precisely like [[nLab:Set]], but in general will not validate the axiom of choice. Homological algebra in such a more general context is the theory of complexes of [[nLab:abelian sheaves]]/[[nLab:sheaves of abelian groups]] and ultimately the theory of _[[nLab:abelian sheaf cohomology]]_. 

This is a major aspect of homological algebra. While we will not discuss this further here in this introduction, the reader might enjoy keeping in mind that all of the following discussion of resolutions of $R$-modules goes through in this wider context of [[nLab:sheaves of modules]] except for subtleties related to the (partial) failure of example \ref{ProjectivesInSet} for the [[nLab:category of sheaves]].

=--

We now characterize projective modules.

+-- {: .num_lemma #FreeModulesAreProjective}
###### Lemma

Assuming the [[nLab:axiom of choice]],
a [[nLab:free module]] $N \simeq R^{(S)}$ is projective.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Explicitly: if $S \in Set$ and $F(S) = R^{(S)}$ is the [[nLab:free module]] on $S$, then a module homomorphism $F(S) \to N$ is specified equivalently by a [[nLab:function]] $f : S \to U(N)$ from $S$ to the underlying set of $N$, which can be thought of as specifying the images of the unit elements in $R^{(S)} \simeq \oplus_{s \in S} R$ of the ${\vert S\vert}$ copies of $R$.

Accordingly then for $\tilde N \to N$ an epimorphism, the underlying function $U(\tilde N) \to U(N)$ is an epimorphism, and the [[nLab:axiom of choice]] in [[nLab:Set]] says that we have all lifts $\tilde f$ in

$$
  \array{
     && U(\tilde N)
     \\
     & {}^{\tilde f} \nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     S &\stackrel{f}{\to}& U(N)
  }
  \,.
$$

By [[nLab:adjunction]] these are equivalently lifts of module homomorphisms

$$
  \array{
     && \tilde N
     \\
     & \nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     R^{(S)} &\stackrel{}{\to}& N
  }
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #DirectSummandOfFreeIsProjective}
###### Lemma

If $N \in R Mod$ is a [[nLab:direct sum|direct summand]] of a [[nLab:free module]], hence if there is $N' \in R Mod$ and $S \in Set$ such that 

$$
  R^{(S)} \simeq N \oplus N'
  \,,
$$

then $N$ is a projective module.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Let $\tilde K \to K$ be a surjective homomorphism of modules and 
$f : N \to K$ a homomorphism. We need to show that there is a lift $\tilde f$ in

$$
  \array{
    && \tilde K
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\tilde f}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    N &\stackrel{f}{\to}& K 
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition of [[nLab:direct sum]] we can factor the [[nLab:identity]] on $N$ as

$$
  id_N : N \to N \oplus N' \to N
  \,.
$$

Since $N \oplus N'$ is free by assumption, and hence projective by lemma \ref{FreeModulesAreProjective}, there is a lift $\hat f$ in 

$$
  \array{
    && && \tilde K
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\hat f}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    N &\to& N \oplus N'  &\to& K
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $\tilde f : N \to N \oplus N' \stackrel{\hat f}{\to} \tilde K$ is a lift of $f$.

+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationOfProjectiveAsDirectSummandOfFree}
###### Proposition

An $R$-module $N$ is projective precisely if it is the [[nLab:direct summand]] of a [[nLab:free module]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{DirectSummandOfFreeIsProjective} if $N$ is a direct summand then it is projective. So we need to show the converse.

Let $F(U(N))$ be the [[nLab:free module]] on the [[nLab:set]] $U(N)$ underlying $N$, hence the [[nLab:direct sum]]

$$
  F(U(n)) = \oplus_{n \in U(n)} R
  \,.
$$

There is a canonical module homomorphism

$$
  \oplus_{n \in U(N)} R \to N
$$

given by sending the unit $1 \in R_n$ of the copy of $R$ in the direct sum labeled by $n \in U(n)$ to $n \in N$.

(Abstractly this is the [[nLab:counit of an adjunction|counit]] 
$\epsilon : F(U(N)) \to N$
of the [[nLab:free functor|free]]/[[nLab:forgetful functor|forgetful]]-[[nLab:adjunction]] $(F \dashv U)$.) 

This is clearly an [[nLab:epimorphism]]. Thefore if $N$ is projective, there is a [[nLab:section]] $s$ of $\epsilon$. This exhibits $N$ as a direct summand of $F(U(N))$.

=--

We discuss next how to build resolutions of chain complexes by projective modules. But before we come to that it is useful to also introduce the _[[nLab:duality|dual]]_ notion. So far we have concentrated on chain complexes with degrees in the natural numbers: non-negative degrees. For a discussion of resolutions we need a more degree-symmetric perspective, which of course is straightforward to obtain.

A [[nLab:cochain complex]] $C^\bullet$ in $\mathcal{A} = R Mod$ is a sequence of morphism

in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $d\circ d = 0$. A [[nLab:homomorphism]] of cochain complexes $f^\bullet : C^\bullet \to D^\bullet$ is a collection of morphisms $\{f^n : C^n \to D^n\}$ such that $d^n_D \circ f^n = f^n \circ d^n_C$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$$
  C^\bullet(X) \coloneqq Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[Sing X], \mathbb{Z}}

Then $H^\bullet(C(X))$ is called the _[[nLab:singular cohomology]]_ of $X$.

###### Remark

Example \ref{DualCochainComplexOfAChainComplex} is just a special case of the [[nLab:internal hom]] of def. \ref{ExplicitDefinitionOfInternalHom}: we may regard cochain complexes in non-negative degree equivalently as chain complexes in positive degree.

Accordingly we say for $C^\bullet$ a cochain complex that

* an element in $C^n$ is an $n$-[[nLab:cochain]]


* an element in $im(d^{n-1})$ is an $n$-[[nLab:coboundary]]

* al element in $ker(d^n)$ is an $n$-[[nLab:cocycle]].

But equivalently we may regard a [[nLab:cochain]] in degree $n$ as a [[nLab:chain]] in degree $(-n)$ and so forth. And this is the perspective used in all of the following.

Let $F(U(N))$ be the [[nLab:free module]] on the [[nLab:set]] $U(N)$ underlying $N$. By lemma \ref{FreeModulesAreProjective} this is a projective module.

The canonical morphism

$$

is clearly a [[nLab:surjection]], hence an [[nLab:epimorphism]] in $R$[[nLab:Mod]].

We now show that similarly $R Mod$ has enough injectives. This is a little bit more work and hence we proceed with a few preparatory statements.

By prop. \ref{InjectiveAbelianGroupIsDivisibleGroup} the following [[nLab:abelian groups]] are injective in [[nLab:Ab]].

The group of [[nLab:rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is injective in [[nLab:Ab]], as is the additive group of [[nLab:real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ and generally that underlying any [[nLab:field]].

###### Proposition

Assuming the [[nLab:axiom of choice]],
the [[nLab:category]] $\mathbb{Z}$[[nLab:Mod]] $\simeq$ [[nLab:Ab]] has [[nLab:injective object|enough injectives]].

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

By prop. \ref{InjectiveAbelianGroupIsDivisibleGroup} an [[nLab:abelian group]]
is an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module precisely if it is a [[nLab:divisible group]]. So we need to show that every [[nLab:abelian group]] is a [[nLab:subgroup]] of a [[nLab:divisible group]].

To start with, notice that the group $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[nLab:rational numbers]] is divisible and hence the canonical embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ shows that the additive group of [[nLab:integers]] embeds into an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module.

Now by the discussion at _[[nLab:projective module]]_ every [[nLab:abelian group]] $A$ receives an [[nLab:epimorphism]] $(\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Z}) \to A$ from a [[nLab:free group|free]] abelian group, hence is the [[nLab:quotient group]] of a [[nLab:direct sum]] of copies of $\mathbb{Z}$. Accordingly it embeds into a quotient $\tilde A$ of a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb{Q}$.

$$
  \array{
    ker &\stackrel{=}{\to}& ker 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Z}) &\hookrightarrow& (\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Q})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\hookrightarrow& \tilde A
  }
$$

Here $\tilde A$ is divisible because the [[nLab:direct sum]] of divisible groups is again divisible, and also the [[nLab:quotient group]] of a divisible groups is again divisble. So this exhibits an embedding of any $A$ into a divisible abelian group, hence into an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module.

for $R$ a [[nLab:ring]], the category $R$[[nLab:Mod]] has [[nLab:injective object|enough injectives]].

The proof uses the following lemma.

Write $U\colon R Mod \to Ab$ for the [[nLab:forgetful functor]] that forgets the $R$-module structure on a module $N$ and just remembers the underlying abelian group $U(N)$.

This is called the **[[nLab:coextension of scalars]]** along the ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to R$.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
**of prop. \ref{ModEnoughInjectives}**

Let $N \in R Mod$. We need to find a monomorphism $N \to \tilde N$ such that $\tilde N$ is an injective $R$-module.


By prop. \ref{AbHasEnoughInjectives} there exists a monomorphism

$$
  i \colon U(N) \hookrightarrow D
$$

of the underlying abelian group into an injective abelian group $D$.


Now consider the $(U \dashv R_*)$-[[nLab:adjunct]] 

$$
  N \to R_*(D)
$$

of $i$, hence the composite

$$
  N \stackrel{\eta_N}{\to} R_*(U(N)) \stackrel{R_*(i)}{\to} R_*(D)
$$

with $R_*$ and $\eta_N$ from lemma \ref{CoextensionOfScalarsForRModToZMod}. On the underlying abelian groups this is

$$
  U(N) \stackrel{U(\eta_N)}{\to} Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(N)) \stackrel{Hom_{Ab}(U(R),i)}{\to}
  Hom_{Ab}(U(R),U(D))
  \,.
$$

Hence this is monomorphism. Therefore it is now sufficient to see that $Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(D))$ is an injective $R$-module.

This follows from the existence of the [[nLab:adjunction]] [[nLab:isomorphism]] given by lemma \ref{CoextensionOfScalarsForRModToZMod}

$$
  Hom_{Ab}(U(K),U(D))
  \simeq
  Hom_{R Mod}(K, Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(D)))
$$

[[nLab:natural isomorphism|natural]] in $K \in R Mod$ and from the injectivity of $D \in Ab$.

We first discuss the existence of injective/projective resolutions, and then the [[nLab:functor|functoriality]] of their constructions.

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[nLab:abelian category]] with [[nLab:injective object|enough injectives]], such as our $R$[[nLab:Mod]] for some [[nLab:ring]] $R$.

Then every object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ has an [[nLab:injective resolution]],

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $X \in \mathcal{A}$ be the given object. 
By remark \ref{InjectiveResolutionInComponents} we need to 
construct an [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} J^1 \stackrel{d^1}{\to}
  J^2 \stackrel{d^2}{\to} \cdots \to J^n \to \cdots 
$$

such that all the $J^\cdot$ are [[nLab:injective objects]].

This we now construct by [[nLab:induction]] on the degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the first step, by the assumption of enough enjectives we find an injective object $J^0$ and a [[nLab:monomorphism]]

$$
  X \hookrightarrow J^0
$$

hence an [[nLab:exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0
  \,.
$$

Assume then by induction hypothesis that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an [[nLab:exact sequence]]

$$
  X \to J^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} \cdots \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n
$$

has been constructed, where all the $J^\cdot$ are injective objects. Forming the [[nLab:cokernel]] of $d^{n-1}$ yields the [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{p}{\to} J^n/J^{n-1} \to 0
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that there are enough injectives in $\mathcal{A}$ we may now again find a monomorphism $J^n/J^{n-1} \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} J^{n+1}$ into an injective object $J^{n+1}$. This being a monomorphism means that 

$$
  J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{d^n \coloneqq i \circ p}{\longrightarrow} J^{n+1}
$$

is [[nLab:exact sequence|exact]] in the middle term. Therefore we now have an [[nLab:exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0 \to \cdots \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{d^{n}}{\to} J^{n+1}

such that all the $J_\cdot$ are [[nLab:projective objects]]. 

This we we now construct by [[nLab:induction]] on the degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the first step, by the assumption of enough projectives we find a projective object $J_0$ and an [[nLab:epimorphism]]

$$
  J_0 \to X
$$

hence an [[nLab:exact sequence]]

$$
  J_0 \to X \to 0

By the assumption that there are enough projectives in $\mathcal{A}$ we may now again find an epimorphism 
$ p : J_{n+1} \to ker(\partial_{n-1})$ out of a projective object $J_{n+1}$. This being an epimorphism means that

  J_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}

To conclude this section we now show that all this work indeed serves to solve the problem indicated above in example \ref{AChainMapThatOughtToBeNullHomotopicButIsNot}.

+-- {: .num_prop #MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic}
###### Proposition

Let $f^\bullet : X^\bullet \to J^\bullet$ be a [[nLab:chain map]] of cochain complexes in non-negative degree, out of an [[nLab:exact sequence|exact complex]] $0 \simeq_{qi} X^\bullet$ to a degreewise injective complex $J^\bullet$. Then there is a [[nLab:null homotopy]] 

$$
  \eta : 0 \Rightarrow f^\bullet
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[nLab:chain homotopy]] we need to construct a sequence of morphisms $(\eta^{n+1} : X^{n+1} \to J^{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that 

$$
  f^n = \eta^{n+1} \circ d^n_X + d^{n-1}_J \circ \eta^n
  \,.
$$

for all $n$. We now construct this by [[nLab:induction]] over $n$. 

It is convenient to start at $n = -1$, take $\eta^{\leq 0} \coloneqq 0$ and $f^{\lt 0} \coloneqq 0$. Then the above condition holds for $n = -1$.

Then in the induction step assume that for given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have constructed $\eta^{\bullet \leq n}$ satisfying the above condition for $f^{\lt n}$ 

First define now 

$$
  g^n \coloneqq f^n - d_J^{n-1} \circ \eta^n
$$

and observe that by induction hypothesis

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g^n \circ d_X^{n-1} 
    & =
    f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X - d^{n-1}_J \circ \eta^n \circ d^{n-1}_X
    \\
    & = f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X - d^{n-1}_J \circ f^{n-1} 
        + d^{n-1}_J \circ d^{n-2}_J \circ \eta^{n-1}
    \\
    & = 0 + 0
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This means that $g^n$ factors as 

$$
  X^n \to X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) \stackrel{g^n}{\to} J^n
  \,,
$$ 

where the first map is the [[nLab:projection]] to the [[nLab:quotient]].

Observe then that by exactness of $X^\bullet$ the morphism
$X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) \stackrel{d^n_X}{\to} X^{n+1}$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]]. Together this gives us a diagram of the form


$$
  \array{
    X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\to}& X^{n+1}
   \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g^n}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\eta^{n+1}}}
    \\
    J^n   }
  \,,
$$ 


where the morphism $\eta^{n+1}$ may be found due to the defining [[nLab:right lifting property]] of the [[nLab:injective object]] $J^n$ against the top monomorphism.

Observing that the [[nLab:commuting diagram|commutativity]] of this diagram is the chain homotopy condition involving $\eta^n$ and $\eta^{n+1}$, this completes the induction step.

Then there is a [[nLab:null homotopy]]

This is formally dual to the proof of prop \ref{MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic}.

Hence we have seen now that injective and projective resolutions of chain complexes serve to make [[nLab:chain homotopy]] interact well with [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]. In the next section we show that this construction lifts from single chain complexes to chain maps between chain complexes and in fact to the whole [[nLab:category of chain complexes]]. The resulting "resolved" category of chain complexes is the _[[nLab:derived category]]_, the true home of the abelian homotopy theory of chain complexes.


##### The derived category
 {#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors}

In the previous section we have seen that every object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ admits an [[nLab:injective resolution]] and a [[nLab:projective resolution]]. Here we lift this construction to morphisms and then to the whole category of chain complexes, up to chain homotopy.


The following proposition says that, when injectively resolving objects, the morphisms between these objects lift to the resolutions, and the following one, prop. \ref{HomotopyUniquenessOfResolutionOfMorphism}, says that this lift is unique up to chain homotopy.

###### Proposition

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{A}$. Let

$$
  i_Y : Y \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Y^\bullet

be an [[nLab:injective resolution]] of $Y$ and 

$$
  i_X : X \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X^\bullet

any [[nLab:monomorphism|monomorphism]] that is a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]] (possibly but not necessarily an injective resolution). Then there is a [[nLab:chain map]] $f^\bullet : X^\bullet \to Y^\bullet$ giving a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

    \\
    Y &\stackrel{\sim}{\to}& Y^\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[nLab:chain map]] we need to construct
[[nLab:morphisms]] $(f^n : X^n \to Y^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that 
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[nLab:diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    X^{n} &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\to}& X^{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y^{n} &\stackrel{d^n_Y}{\to}& Y^{n+1}
  }
$$

[[nLab:commuting diagram|commute]] (the defining condition on a [[nLab:chain map]]) and such that the diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i_X}{\to}& X^0
    \\
    \downarrow^{f} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^0}}
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{i_Y}{\to}& Y^0
  }
$$

commutes in $\mathcal{A}$ (which makes the full diagram in $Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ commute).

We construct these $f^\bullet = (f^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ by [[nLab:induction]].


To start the induction, the morphism $f^0$ in the last diagram above can be found by the defining [[nLab:right lifting property]] of the [[nLab:injective object]] $Y^0$ against the [[nLab:monomorphism]] $i_X$.

Assume then that for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ component maps $f^{\bullet \leq n}$ have been obtained such that $d^k_Y\circ f^k = f^{k+1}\circ d^k_X$ for all $0 \leq k \lt n$ . In order to construct $f^{n+1}$ consider the following diagram, which we will describe/construct stepwise from left to right:

$$
  \array{
    X^n &\stackrel{}{\to}& X^n/im(d^{n-1}_X) &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\hookrightarrow}& X^{n+1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f^n}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g^n}}
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h^n}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{f^{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y^n &\underset{d^n_Y}{\to}& Y^{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the morphism $f^n$ on the left is given by induction assumption and we define the diagonal morphism to be the composite

$$
 g^n \coloneqq d^n_Y \circ f^n
 \,.
$$

Observe then that by the chain map property of the $f^{\bullet \leq n}$ we have

$$
  d^n_Y \circ f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X = d^n_Y \circ d^{n-1}_Y \circ f^{n-1} = 0
$$

and therefore $g^n$ factors through $X^n/im(d^{n-1}_X)$ via some $h^n$ as indicated in the middle of the above diagram. Finally the morphism on the top right is a monomorphism by the fact that $X^{\bullet}$ is [[nLab:exact sequence|exact]] in positive degrees (being [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to a complex concentrated in degree 0) and so a lift $f^{n+1}$ as shown on the far right of the diagram exists by the defining lifting property of the injective object $Y^{n+1}$. 

The total outer diagram now [[nLab:commuting diagram|commutes]], being built from commuting sub-diagrams, and this is the required chain map property of $f^{\bullet \leq n+1}$ This completes the induction step.

The morphism $f_\bullet$ in prop. \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms} is the unique one up to [[nLab:chain homotopy]] making the given diagram commute.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given two cochain maps $g_1^\bullet, g_2^\bullet$ making the diagram commute, a [[nLab:chain homotopy]] $g_1^\bullet \Rightarrow g_2^\bullet$ is equivalently a [[nLab:null homotopy]] $0 \Rightarrow g_2^\bullet - g_1^\bullet$ of the difference, which sits in a square of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\underoverset{h^\bullet}{\sim}{\to}& X^\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^\bullet \coloneqq g_2^\bullet - g_1^\bullet}}
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{\sim}{\to}& Y^\bullet
  }
$$

with the left vertical morphism being the [[nLab:zero morphism]]
(and the bottom an injective resolution). Hence we have to show that in such a diagram $f^\bullet$ is null-homotopic.

This we may reduce to the statement of prop. \ref{MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic}
by considering instead of $f^\bullet$ the induced chain map of augmented complexes


$$
  \array{
     0 
       &\stackrel{}{\to}& 
     X 
       &\stackrel{h^0}{\to}& 
     X^0 
       &\stackrel{d^0_X}{\to}& 
     X^1 
       &\to&
    \cdots
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^{-2} = 0}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^{-1} = 0}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{f^0}
     &&
     \downarrow^{f^1}
     \\
     0 
       &\to& 
     Y 
       &\to& 
     Y^0 
       &\stackrel{d^0_J}{\to}& 
     Y^1 
       &\to& 
     \cdots  
  }
  \,,
$$

where the second square from the left commutes due to the commutativity of the original square of chain complexes in degree 0.

Since $h^\bullet$ is a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]], the top chain complex is [[nLab:exact sequence|exact]], by remark \ref{InjectiveResolutionInComponents}. Moreover the bottom complex consists of [[nLab:injective objects]] from the second degree on (the former degree 0). Hence 
the induction in the proof of prop. \ref{MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic} implies the existence of a [[nLab:null homotopy]]

starting with $\eta^{-1} = 0$ and $\eta^{0 } = 0$ (notice that the proof prop. \ref{MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic} was formulated exactly this way), which works because $f^{-1} = 0$. The de-augmentation $\{f^{\bullet \geq 0}\}$ of this is the desired [[nLab:null homotopy]] of $f^\bullet$.

We now discuss how the injective/projective resolutions constructed above are [[nLab:functor|functorial]] if regarded in the [[nLab:homotopy category of chain complexes]], def. \ref{TheStrongHomotopyCategory}. For definiteness, to be able to distinguish chain complexes from cochain complexes, introduce the following notation.

###### Remark

Often one defines the [[nLab:derived category]] by more general abstract means than we have introduced here, namely as the _[[nLab:localization]]_ of the category of chain complexes at the [[quasi-isomorphisms]]. If one does this, then the simple definition def. \ref{DerivedCategory} is instead a _theorem_. The interested reader can find more details and further pointers _[here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/derived%20category#InTermsOfResolutions)_.

If $\mathcal{A}$ has [[nLab:injective object|enough injectives]], def. \ref{EnoughInjectivesEnoughProjectives}, then there exists a [[nLab:functor]]

$$
  P : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}^\bullet(\mathcal{A}) = \mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{A}})

and

$$
  H^{n \geq 1}(-) \circ P \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ExistenceOfInjectiveResolutions} every object $X^\bullet \in Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ has an injective resolution. 
Proposition \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms} says that for $X \to X^\bullet$ and $X \to \tilde X^\bullet$ two resolutions there is a morphism $X^\bullet \to \tilde X^\bullet$ in $\mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ and prop. \ref{HomotopyUniquenessOfResolutionOfMorphism} says that this morphism is unique in $\mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$. In particular it is therefore an [[nLab:isomorphism]] in $\mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ (since the composite with the reverse lifted morphism, also being unique, has to be the identity). 

So choose one such injective resolution $P(X)^\bullet$ for each $X^\bullet$.

Then for $f : X \to Y$ any morphism in $\mathcal{A}$, 
proposition \ref{ExistenceOfInjectiveResolutions} again says that it can be lifted to a morphism between $P(X)^\bullet$ and $P(Y)^\bullet$ and proposition \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms} says that there is an image in $\mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, unique for morphism making the given diagram commute. 

This implies that this assignment of morphisms is [[nLab:functor|functorial]], since then also the composites are unique.

Dually we have:

For actually working with the [[nLab:derived category]], the following statement is of central importance, which we record here without proof (which requires a bit of [[nLab:localization]] theory). It says that for computing [[nLab:hom-sets]] in the derived category, it is in fact sufficient to just resolve the domain or the codomain.

+-- {: .num_prop #ResolutuionInOneArgumentIsSufficientForDerivedHom}

$$
  \mathcal{D}_\bullet(Q(X)_\bullet, Q(Y)_\bullet)
  \simeq
  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(Q(X)_\bullet, Y_\bullet)
  \,. 
$$

Dually, for $X^\bullet, Y^\bullet \in Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, we have a natural isomorphism

$$

  \simeq
  \mathcal{K}^\bullet(X^\bullet, P(Y)^\bullet)

In conclusion we have found that there are _resolution functors_ that embed $\mathcal{A}$ in the homotopically correct context of resolved chain complexes with chain maps up to chain homotopy between them. 

In the next section we discuss the general properties of this "homotopically correct context": the [[nLab:derived category]].

##### Derived functors
 {#DerivedFunctors}

In the previous section we have seen how the entire category $\mathcal{A}$ (= $R$[[nLab:Mod]]) embeds into its [[nLab:derived category]], the category of degreewise [[nLab:injective object|injective]] [[nLab:cochain complexes]] 

$$
  P : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}^\bullet(\mathcal{A}) = \mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{A}})
$$

or degreewise [[nLab:projective object|projective]] [[nLab:chain complexes]] 

$$
 Q : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) =  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}})
$$


modulo [[nLab:chain homotopy]]. This construction of the derived category naturally gives rise to the following notion of [[nLab:derived functors]].

+-- {: .num_defn #AdditiveFunctor}
###### Definition

For $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ two [[nLab:abelian categories]] (e.g. $R$[[nLab:Mod]] and $R'$[[nLab:Mod]]), a [[nLab:functor]]

$$
  F \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

is called an **[[nLab:additive functor]]** if 

1. $F$ maps [[nLab:generalized the|the]] [[nLab:zero object]] to the zero object, $F(0) \simeq 0 \in \mathcal{B}$; 

1. given any two [[nLab:objects]] $x, y \in \mathcal{A}$, there is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] $F(x \oplus y) \cong F(x) \oplus F(y)$, and this respects the inclusion and projection maps of the [[nLab:direct sum]]:

$$
\array { x &          &            &          & y \\
           & {}_{\mathllap{i_X}}\searrow &            & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{i_y}} \\

+-- {: .num_defn #ProlongationOfFunctorToChainComplexes}
###### Definition

Given an [[nLab:additive functor]] $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}'$, it canonically induces a functor 

$$
  Ch_\bullet(F) \colon Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}')
$$

between [[nLab:categories of chain complexes]] (its "prolongation") by applying it to each [[nLab:chain complex]] and to all the diagrams in the definition of a [[nLab:chain map]]. Similarly it preserves [[nLab:chain homotopies]] and hence it passes to the quotient given by the strong [[nLab:homotopy category of chain complexes]]

$$
  \mathcal{K}(F) \colon \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A}')
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

If $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}'$ have [[nLab:projective object|enough projectives]], then their [[nLab:derived categories]] are

$$
  \mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}})
$$

and 

$$
  \mathcal{D}^\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \simeq \mathcal{K}^\bullet(\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{A}})
$$

etc. One wants to accordingly _derive_ from $F$ a functor $\mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ between these derived categories. It is immediate to achieve this on the domain category, there we can simply precompose and form

$$
  \mathcal{A}  
    \to 
  \mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A})
   \simeq
  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}}) 
   \hookrightarrow
  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{A})
   \stackrel{\mathcal{K}_\bullet(F)}{\to}
  \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}')
  \,.
$$

But the resulting composite lands in $\mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}')$ and in general does not factor through the inclusion $\mathcal{D}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}') = \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}'}) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{K}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}')$.

In a more general abstract discussion than we present here, one finds that by applying a projective resolution functor _on chain complexes_, one can enforce this factorization. However, by definition of [[nLab:resolution]], the resulting chain complex is [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the one obtained by the above composite. 

This means that if one is only interested in the "weak chain homology type" of the chain complex in the image of a [[nLab:derived functor]], then forming [[nLab:chain homology]] groups of the chain complexes in the images of the above composite gives the desired information. This is what def. \ref{RightDerivedFunctorOfLeftExactFunctor} and def. \ref{LeftDerivedFunctorOfRightExactFunctor} below do.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #LeftRightExactFunctor}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{A}'$ be two [[nLab:abelian categories]], for instance $\mathcal{A} = R $[[nLab:Mod]] and $\mathcal{A}' = R'$[[nLab:Mod]]. Then a [[nLab:functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}'$ 
which preserves [[nLab:direct sums]] (and hence in particular the [[nLab:zero object]]) is called

* a **[[nLab:left exact functor]]** if it preserves [[nLab:kernels]];

* a **[[nLab:right exact functor]]** if it preserves [[nLab:cokernels]];

* an **[[nLab:exact functor]]** if it is both left and right exact.

=--

Here to "preserve kernels" means that for every morphism $X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ in $\mathcal{A}$ we have an [[nLab:isomorphism]] on the left of the following [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    F(ker(f)) &\to& F(X) & \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} & F(Y)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
    \\
    ker(F(f)) &\to& F(X) &\stackrel{F(f)}{\to}& F(Y)
  }
  \,,
$$

hence that both rows are [[nLab:exact sequence|exact]]. And dually for right exact functors.

We record the following immediate consequence of this definition (which in the literature is often taken to be the definition).

+-- {: .num_prop #LeftRightExactFunctorsCharacterizedByExactSequences}
###### Proposition

If $F$ is a left exact functor, then for every [[nLab:exact sequence]]  of the form

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C
$$

also 

$$
  0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C)
$$

is an exact sequence. Dually, if $F$ is a right exact functor, then for every [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  A \to B \to C \to 0
$$

also 

$$
  F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to 0
$$

is an exact sequence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $0 \to A \to B \to C$ is exact then $A \hookrightarrow B$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]] by prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfShortExactSequences}.
But then the statement that $A \to B \to C$ is exact at $B$ says 
precisely that $A$ is the [[nLab:kernel]] of $B \to C$. 
So if $F$ is left exact then by definition also $F(A) \to F(B)$
is the kernel of $F(B) \to F(C)$ and so is in particular also 
a monomorphism.
Dually for right exact functors.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{LeftRightExactFunctorsCharacterizedByExactSequences} is
clearly the motivation for the terminology in def. \ref{LeftRightExactFunctor}: a functor is left exact if is preserves short exact sequences to the left, and right exact if it preserves them to the right.

is an exact sequence. But this means that

###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ExistenceOfInjectiveResolutions} we can choose $f_\bullet$ and $h_\bullet$. The task is now to construct the third resolution $g_\bullet$ such as to obtain a short exact sequence of chain complexes, hence degreewise a short exact sequence, in the two row.

To construct this, let for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  B_n \coloneqq A_n \oplus C_n
$$

be the [[nLab:direct sum]] and let the top horizontal morphisms be the canonical inclusion and projection maps of the direct sum.

Let then furthermore (in [[nLab:matrix calculus]] notation)

$$
  g_0 = 
   \left(
     \array{
        (j_0)_A  
        & 
        (j_0)_B
      }
  \right)
 : A_0 \oplus C_0 \to B
$$

be given in the first component by the given composite

$$
 (g_0)_A : A_0 \oplus C_0 \stackrel{}{\to} A_0 \stackrel{f_0}{\to} A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} B
$$

and in the second component we take

$$
  (j_0)_C : A_0 \oplus C_0 \to C_0 \stackrel{\zeta}{\to} B
$$

to be given by a lift in

$$
  \array{
    && B
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\zeta}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    C_0 &\stackrel{h_0}{\to}& C
  }

which exists by the [[nLab:left lifting property]] of the [[nLab:projective object]]
$C_0$ (since $C_\bullet$ is a projective resolution) against the [[nLab:epimorphism]] $p : B \to C$ of the [[nLab:short exact sequence]].

In total this gives in degree 0

$$
  \array{
    A_0 &\hookrightarrow& A_0 \oplus C_0 &\to& C_0

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_0}} && {}^{\mathllap{((g_0)_A, (g_0)_C)}}\downarrow &\swarrow_{\zeta}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_0}}

which exists since $C_1$ is a [[nLab:projective object]] and $A_0 \to A$ is an epimorphism by $A_\bullet$ being a projective resolution. Here we are using that by exactness the bottom morphism indeed factors through $A$ as indicated, because the definition of $\zeta$ and  the chain complex property of $C_\bullet$ gives 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p \circ \zeta \circ d^{C_\bullet}_0 
    &= 
    h_0 \circ d^{C_\bullet}_0
    \\
    & = 0 \circ h_1
    \\
    & = 0 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$ 

Now in the induction step, assuming that $e_{n-1}$ has been been found satisfying the chain complex property, let $e_n$ be a lift in

$$
  \array{
    & && A_n
    \\
    & & {}^{\mathllap{e_{n}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d^{A_\bullet}_{n-1}}}
    \\
    e_{n-1}\circ d_n^{C_\bullet} \colon & C_{n+1} &\stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow}& ker(d^{A_\bullet}_{n-1}) = im(d^{A_\bullet}_{n-1})) &\to& A_{n-1}
  }
  \,,
$$


which again exists since $C_{n+1}$ is projective. That the bottom morphism factors as indicated is the chain complex property of $e_{n-1}$ inside $d^{B_\bullet}_{n-1}$.

To see that the $d^{B_\bullet}$ defines this way indeed squares to 0 notice that

$$
  d^{B_\bullet}_{n}
  \circ
  d^{B_\bullet}_{n+1}
  = 
  \left(
    \array{
       0 &  (-1)^{n}\left(e_{n} \circ d^{C_\bullet}_{n+1} - d^{A_\bullet}_n \circ e_{n+1} \right) 
       \\
       0 & 0
     }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This vanishes by the very commutativity of the above diagram.


This establishes $g_\bullet$ such that the above diagram commutes and the bottom row is degreewise a short exact sequence, in fact a [[nLab:split exact sequence]], by construction. 

To see that $g_\bullet$ is indeed a quasi-isomorphism, consider the [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]] associated to the short exact sequence of cochain complexes $0 \to A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to 0$. In positive degrees it implies that the chain homology of $B_\bullet$ indeed vanishes. In degree 0 it gives the short sequence $0 \to A \to H_0(B_\bullet) \to B\to 0$ sitting in a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& A &\hookrightarrow& H_0(B_\bullet) &\to& C &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}} && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}} && \downarrow
    \\
    0 &\to& A &\hookrightarrow& B &\to& C &\to& 0 
    \,,
  }
$$

where both rows are exact. That the middle vertical morphism is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] then follows by the [[nLab:five lemma]].

=--

Let $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ be [[nLab:abelian categories]] and assume that $\mathcal{A}$ has [[nLab:injective object|enough injectives]].

Let $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ be a [[nLab:left exact functor]] and let

in $\mathcal{B}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfExactSequenceByExactSequence} we can find an injective resolution

$$
  0 \to A^\bullet \to B^\bullet \to C^\bullet \to 0
$$

of the given exact sequence which is itself again an exact sequence of cochain complexes.

Since $A^n$ is an [[nLab:injective object]] for all $n$, its component sequences $0 \to A^n \to B^n \to C^n \to 0$ are indeed [[nLab:split exact sequences]] (see the discussion there). Splitness is preserved by any functor $F$ (and also since $F$ is [[nLab:additive functor|additive]] it even preserves the [[nLab:direct sum]] structure that is chosen in the proof of lemma \ref{ProjectiveResolutionOfExactSequenceByExactSequence}) and so it follows that

$$
  0 \to F(\tilde A^\bullet) \to F(\tilde B^\bullet) \to F(\tilde C^\bullet) \to 0
$$

is a again short exact sequence of cochain complexes, now in $\mathcal{B}$. Hence we have the corresponding [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]] from prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}:


$$
  \cdots
   \to
  H^{n-1}(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^{n-1}(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^{n-1}(F(C^\bullet))
    \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H^n(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^n(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^n(F(C^\bullet))
    \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H^{n+1}(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^{n+1}(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^{n+1}(F(C^\bullet))
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

By construction of the resolutions and by def. \ref{RightDerivedFunctorOfLeftExactFunctor}, this is equal to

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  R^{n-1}F(A) \to R^{n-1}F(B) \to R^{n-1}F(C) 
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  R^{n}F(A) \to R^{n}F(B) \to R^{n}F(C)

  R^{n+1}F(A) \to R^{n+1}F(B) \to R^{n+1}F(C) 
   \to
  \cdots

Finally the equivalence of the first three terms with $F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C)$ is given by prop. \ref{BasicPropertiesOfDerivedFunctors}.

+-- {: .num_remark #DerivedFunctorAsObstructionToExactness}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence} implies that one way to interpret $R^1 F(A)$ is as a "measure for how a [[nLab:left exact functor]] $F$ fails to be an [[nLab:exact functor]]". For, with $A \to B \to C$ any [[nLab:short exact sequence]], this proposition gives the exact sequence

$$
  0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to R^1 F(A)
$$

and hence $0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to 0$ is a short exact sequence itself precisely if $R^1 F(A) \simeq 0$.

Dually, if $F$ is [[nLab:right exact functor]], then $L_1 F (C)$ "measures how $F$ fails to be exact" for then 

$$
  L_1F (C) \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to 0
$$

is an exact sequence and hence is a short exact sequence precisely if $L_1F(C) \simeq 0$.

and

$$

###### Proof

Because an [[nLab:exact functor]] preserves all [[nLab:exact sequences]]. If $Y_\bullet \to A$ is a projective resolution then also $F(Y)_\bullet$ is exact in all positive degrees, and hence $L_{n\geq 1} F(A) ) H_{n \geq}(F(Y)) = 0$. Dually for $R^n F$.

###### Definition

Let $F \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ be a left or right exact additive functor. An object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is called an $F$-**[[nLab:acyclic object]]** is all positive-degree right/left derived functors of $F$ are zero. 

=--

Acyclic objects are useful for computing derived functors on non-acyclic objects. More generally, we now discuss how the derived functor of an additive functor $F$ may also be computed not necessarily with genuine injective/projective resolutions, but with (just) "$F$-injective"/"$F$-projective resolutions".

While projective resolutions in $\mathcal{A}$ are _sufficient_ for computing _every_ [[nLab:left derived functor]] on $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ and injective resolutions are sufficient for computing _every_ [[nLab:right derived functor]] on $Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, if one is interested just in a single functor $F$ then such resolutions may be more than _necessary_. A weaker kind of resolution which is still sufficient is then often more convenient for applications. These _$F$-projective resolutions_ and _$F$-injective resolutions_, respectively, we discuss now. A special case of both are _$F$-[[nLab:acyclic resolutions]]_.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the case that $F$ is right exact. The other case works dually.
Then the first condition of def. \ref{FInjectives} is satisfied because every [[nLab:injective object]] is an $F$-[[nLab:acyclic object]] and by assumption there are enough of these. 

For the second and third condition of def. \ref{FInjectives} use that there is the [[nLab:long exact sequence]] of [[nLab:derived functors]] prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence}

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C \to R^1 F(A) \to R^1 F(B) \to R^1 F(C) \to R^2 F(A) \to R^2 F(B) \to R^2 F(C) \to \cdot
  \,.
$$

For the second condition, by assumption on $A$ and $B$ and definition of $F$-[[nLab:acyclic object]] we have $R^n F(A) \simeq 0$ and $R^n F(B) \simeq 0$ for $n \geq 1$ and hence short exact sequences

$$
  0 \to 0 \to R^n F(C) \to 0
$$

which imply that $R^n F(C)\simeq 0$ for all $n \geq 1$, hence that $C$ is acyclic. 

Similarly, the third condition is equivalent to $R^1 F(A) \simeq 0$.

Consider the following collection of [[nLab:short exact sequences]] obtained from the [[nLab:long exact sequence]] $X^\bullet$:

$$
  0 \to X^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} X^1 \stackrel{d^1}{\to} im(d^1) \to 0
$$

$$
  0 \to im(d^1) \to X^2 \stackrel{d^2}{\to} im(d^2) \to 0
$$

$$
  0 \to im(d^2) \to X^3 \stackrel{d^3}{\to} im(d^3) \to 0
$$

and so on. Going by [[nLab:induction]] through this list and using the second condition in def. \ref{FInjectives} we have that all the $im(d^n)$ are in $\mathcal{I}$. Then the third condition in def. \ref{FInjectives} says that all the sequences

$$
  0 \to F(im(d^n)) \to F(X^n+1) \to F(im(d^{n+1})) \to 0

are [[nLab:short exact sequence|exact]]. But this means that 

$$
  0 \to F(X^0)\to F(X^1) \to F(X^2) \to \cdots

is exact, hence that $F(X^\bullet)$ is quasi-isomorphic to 0.

$$

between the $n$th right derived functor, def. \ref{RightDerivedFunctorOfLeftExactFunctor} of $F$ evaluated on $A$ and the [[nLab:cochain cohomology]] of $F$ applied to the $F$-injective resolution $I_F^\bullet$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ExistenceOfInjectiveResolutions} we can also find an injective resolution $A \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} I^\bullet$. By prop. \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms} there is a lift of the identity on $A$ to a [[nLab:chain map]] $I^\bullet_F \to I^\bullet$ such that the [[nLab:diagram]]

$$

[[nLab:commuting diagram|commutes]] in $Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$. Therefore by the [[nLab:2-out-of-3]] property of [[nLab:quasi-isomorphisms]] it follows that $f$ is a quasi-isomorphism

Let $Cone(f) \in Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ be the [[nLab:mapping cone]] of $f$ and let $I^\bullet \to Cone(f)$ be the canonical [[nLab:chain map]] into it. By the explicit formulas for mapping cones, we have that 

1. there is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] $F(Cone(f)) \simeq Cone(F(f))$;

1. $Cone(f) \in Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{I})\subset Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ (because $F$-injective objects are closed under [[nLab:direct sum]]).

The first implies that we have a [[nLab:homology exact sequence]]

$$
  \cdots \to H^n(I^\bullet) \to H^n(I_F^\bullet) \to H^n(Cone(f)^\bullet)
   \to H^{n+1}(I^\bullet) \to H^{n+1}(I_F^\bullet) \to H^{n+1}(Cone(f)^\bullet) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

Observe that with $f^\bullet$ a quasi-isomorphism $Cone(f^\bullet)$ is quasi-isomorphic to 0. Therefore 
the second item above implies with lemma \ref{FPreservesNullnessOfFInjectiveComplexes} that also $F(Cone(f))$ is quasi-isomorphic to 0. This finally means that the above homology exact sequences consists of exact pieces of the form

$$
  0 \to (R^n F(A)\coloneqq H^n(I^\bullet) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H^n(I_F^\bullet) \to 0

This concludes the discussion of the general definition and the general properties of derived functors that we will consider here. In the next section we discuss the two archetypical examples.

##### Fundamental examples of derived functors 
  {#ExamplesOfDerivedFunctors}

We introduce here the two archetypical examples of [[nLab:derived functors]] and discuss their basic properties. In the next chapter _[IV) The fundamental theorems](#TheFundamentalTheorems)_ we discuss how to use these derived functors for obtaining deeper statements.

Above we have seen the definition and basic general properties of _[[nLab:derived functors]]_ obtained from left/right [[nLab:exact functors]] between [[nLab:abelian categories]]. 

Of all [[nLab:functors]], a most fundamental one is the [[nLab:hom-functor]] of a given category. For categories such as  $R$[[nLab:Mod]] considered here, it comes with its _[[nLab:left adjoint]]_, the [[nLab:tensor product]] functor, which is hence equally fundamentally important. Here we discuss the [[nLab:derived functors]] of these two basic functors in detail.

For simplicity -- this here being an introduction -- we will discuss various statements only over $R = \mathbb{Z}$, hence for [[nLab:abelian groups]]. The main simplification that this leads to is the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #NielsenSchreierTheorem}
###### Proposition

Every [[nLab:subgroup]] of a [[nLab:free group|free]] [[nLab:abelian group]] is itself a [[nLab:free group]].

This is a classical fact going back to Dedekind, now known (in its generalization to not-necessarily abelian groups) as the [[nLab:Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]. For us it is interesting due to the following consequence

+-- {: .num_prop #ShortProjectiveResolutionsForAbelianGroups}
###### Proposition

Assuming the [[nLab:axiom of choice]], every [[nLab:abelian group]] $A$ admits a [[nLab:projective resolution]], def. \ref{ProjectiveResolution}, concentrated in degree 0 and degree 1, hence a resolution which under remark \ref{ProjectiveResolutionInComponents} corresponds to a [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to F_1 \to F_0 \to A \to 0
$$

where $F_0$ and $F_1$ are [[nLab:projective object|projective]], indeed [[nLab:free abelian group|free]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the proof of prop. \ref{ModHasEnoughProjectives} there is an [[nLab:epimorphism]] $F_0 \to A$ out of a [[nLab:free abelian group]] (take for instance $F_0 = F(U(A))$, the free abelian group in the underlying set of $A$). By prop. \ref{NielsenSchreierTheorem} the [[nLab:kernel]] of this epimorphism is itself a free group, and hence by prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfProjectiveAsDirectSummandOfFree} is itself projective. Take this kernel to be $F_1 \hookrightarrow F_0$.

This fact drastically constrains the complexity of right derived functors on abelian groups:

###### Proposition

Let $F \colon Ab \to Ab$ be an [[nLab:additive functor]] which is [[nLab:left exact functor]]. Then its [[nLab:right derived functors]] $R^n F$ vanish for all $n \geq 2$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ShortProjectiveResolutionsForAbelianGroups} there is a projective resolution of any $A \in Ab$ of the form $F_\bullet = [\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to F_1 \to F_0]$.  This implies the claim by def. \ref{RightDerivedFunctorOfLeftExactFunctor}.

###### Remark

The conclusion of prop. \ref{ShortProjectiveResolutionsForAbelianGroups} holds more generally over every ring which is a [[nLab:principal ideal domain]]. This includes in particular $R = k$ a [[nLab:field]], in which case $R Mod \simeq k$[[nLab:Vect]]. On the other hand, every $k$-vector space is already projective itself, so that in this case the whole theory of right derived functors trivializes.

  Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(-,-) \colon \mathcal{A}^{op}\times \mathcal{A} \to Ab
  \,,
$$

where $\mathcal{A}^{op}$ is the [[nLab:opposite category]] of $\mathcal{A}$.  This functor sends a morphism

$$
  \array{
    (X_1 , A_1)
    \\
    (\uparrow , \downarrow)
    \\
    (X_2, A_2)
  }
  \;\;\;
  \in 
  \mathcal{A}^{op} \times \mathcal{A}
$$

to the [[nLab:linear map]] which sends a [[nLab:homomorphism]] $(X_1 \stackrel{f}{\to} A_1) \in Hom(X_1,A_1)$ to the [[nLab:composition|composite]] homomorphism

$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A_2
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X_2 && A_2
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \in Hom(X_2, A_2)
  \,.
$$

In particular if we hold the first argument fixed on an object $X \in \mathcal{A}$, then this yields a functor

$$
  Hom(X,-) \colon \mathcal{A} \to Ab
$$

and if we keep the second argument fixed on an object $A \in \mathcal{A}$, then this yields a functor

$$
  Hom(-,A) \colon \mathcal{A}^{op} \to Ab
  \,.
$$

This functor we have already seen above in example \ref{DualCochainComplexOfAChainComplex}.

A very basic fact is the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #LeftExactnessOfHom}
###### Proposition

The functor $Hom(-,-)\colon \mathcal{A}^{op} \times \mathcal{A} \to Ab$
is a left exact functor, def. \ref{LeftRightExactFunctor}. In particular for every $X \in \mathcal{A}$ the functor $Hom(X,-)\colon \mathcal{A} \to Ab$ is left exact, and for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$ the functor $Hom(-,A) \colon \mathcal{A}^{op} \to Ab$ is left exact.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A [[nLab:kernel]] in the [[nLab:opposite category]] $\mathcal{A}^{op}$ is equivalently a [[nLab:cokernel]] in $\mathcal{A}$. Hence if we regard $Hom(-,A)$ instead as a [[nLab:contravariant functor]] from $\mathcal{A}$ to [[nLab:Ab]], then the statement that it is left exact means that (on top of preserving [[nLab:direct sums]]) it sends [[nLab:cokernels]] in $\mathcal{A}$ to [[nLab:kernels]] in [[nLab:Ab]].

=--

We therefore have the corresponding right [[nLab:derived functor]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #ExtFunctorAsRightDerivedContravariantHom}
###### Definition

For given $A \in \mathcal{A}$, write

$$
  Ext^\bullet(-,A) \coloneqq R^\bullet Hom(-,A) \colon \mathcal{A} \to Ab
$$

for the right derived functor, def. \ref{RightDerivedFunctorOfLeftExactFunctor}, of the [[nLab:hom-functor]] in the first argument, according to prop. \ref{LeftExactnessOfHom}.

This is called the **[[nLab:Ext]]**-functor.

=--

The basic property of the derived Hom-functor/[[nLab:Ext]]-functor is that it classifies _[[nLab:group extensions]]_ by (suspensions of) $A$. This we now discuss in detail, starting from a basic discussion of group extensions themselves.

The following definition essentially just repeats that of a short exact sequence above in def. \ref{ShortExactSequence}, but now we consider it for $G$ a possibly nonabelian group and think of it slightly differently regarding these sequences up to homomorphisms as in def. \ref{MorphismOfGroupExtensions} below. Equivalently we may think of the following as a discussion of the _classification_ of short exact sequences when the leftmost and rightmost component are held fixed.

+-- {: .num_defn #GroupExtension}
###### Definition

Two consecutive [[nLab:homomorphisms]] of [[nLab:groups]]

\[\label{shortExtension} 
  A
  \overset{i}\hookrightarrow \hat G\overset{p}\to G
\]

are a **[[nLab:short exact sequence]]** if 

1. $i$ is [[nLab:monomorphism]], 

1. $p$ an [[nLab:epimorphism]] 

1. the [[nLab:image]] of $i$ is all of the [[nLab:kernel]] of $p$: $ker(p)\simeq im(i)$. 

We say that such a short exact sequence exhibits $\hat G$ as a **[[nLab:group extension]]** of $G$ by $A$.

If $A \hookrightarrow \hat G$ factors through the [[nLab:center]] of $\hat G$ we say that this is a **[[nLab:central extension]]**.

Sometimes in the literature one sees $\hat G$ called an extension "of $A$ by $G$". This is however in conflict with terms such as _[[nLab:central extension]]_, _[[nLab:extension of principal bundles]]_, etc, where the extension is always regarded _of the base, by the [[nLab:fiber]]_.

###### Definition

For $G$ and $A$  [[nLab:groups]], write 
$Ext(G,A)$ for the set of [[nLab:equivalence classes]] of extensions of $G$ by $A$, as above and $CentrExt(G,A) \hookrightarrow Ext(G,A)$ for for the [[nLab:central extensions]]. If $G$ and $A$ are both abelian, write

$$
  AbExt(G,A) \hookrightarrow CentrExt(G,A)
$$

for the subset of _abelian groups_ $\hat G$ that are (necessarily central) extensions of $G$ by $A$. 

=--

We discuss now the following two ways that the $Ext^1$ knows about such group extensions.

1. Central extensions of a possibly non-abelian group $G$ are classified by the degree-2 [[nLab:group cohomology]] $H^2_{Grp}(G,A)$ of $G$ with [[nLab:coefficients]] in $A$, and this in turn is equivalently computed by $Ext^1_{\mathbb{Z}[G] Mod}(\mathbb{Z}, A)$, where $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ is the [[nLab:group ring]] of $G$.

   This is theorem \ref{Degree2GroupCohomologyByExt1} below.

1. Abelian extensions of an abelian gorup $G$ are classified by $Ext^1_{Ab}(G,A)$. In fact, generally, in an [[nLab:abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$ extensions of $G \in \mathcal{A}$ by $A \in \mathcal{A}$ (in the sense of [[nLab:short exact sequences]] $A \to \hat G \to G$) are classified by $Ext^1_{\mathcal{A}}(G,A)$.

  This is prop \ref{Ext1ClassifiesExtensions} below.


We first discuss now _[[nLab:group cohomology]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #Group2CocycleInAbelianGroupWithTrivialAction}
###### Definition

Let $G$ be group and $A$ an [[nLab:abelian group|abelian]] group (regarded as being equipped with the trivial $G$-[[nLab:action]]).

Then a **group 2-[[nLab:cocycle]]** on $G$ with [[nLab:coefficients]] in $A$ is a [[nLab:function]]

$$
  c \colon G \times G \to A
$$

such that for all $(g_1, g_2) \in G \times G$ it satisfies the [[nLab:equation]]

\[
  \label{2CocycleConditionForCentralExtension}
  c(g_1, g_2)
  -
  c(g_1, g_2 \cdot g_3)
  +
  c(g_1 \cdot g_2, g_3)
  - 
  c(g_2, g_3)
  = 
  0
  \;\;\;\; \in A
\]

(called the **2-cocycle condition**). 

For $c, \tilde c$ two such cocycles, a **[[nLab:coboundary]]** $h \colon c \to \tilde c$ between them is a [[nLab:function]]

$$
  h \colon G \to A
$$

such that for all $(g_1,g_2) \in G \times G$ the [[nLab:equation]]

\[
  \label{Group2CoboundaryEquation}
  \tilde c(g_1, g_2)

holds in $A$, where

$$
  (d h)(g_1, g_2) \coloneqq h(g_1 g_2) - h(g_1) - h(g_2)
$$


is a **2-coboundary**. 

The degree-2 **group cohomology** is the set 

$$
  H^2_{Grp}(G,A) = 2Cocycles(G,A) / Coboundaries(G,A)
$$

of [[nLab:equivalence classes]] of group 2-cocycles modulo group coboundaries. This is itself naturally an [[nLab:abelian group]] under pointwise addition of cocycles in $A$

$$
  [c_1] + [c_2] = [c_1 + c_2]
$$

where

$$

The cocycle condition (eq:2CocycleConditionForCentralExtension) evaluated on

Similarly the 2-cocycle condition applied to

By lemma \ref{2CocycleOngeisSameasOnee} it is sufficient to

Now given $c$, let $h \colon G \to A$ be given by

+-- {: .num_defn #CentralExtensionAssociatedTo2Cocycle}
###### Definition
**(central extension associated to group 2-cocycle)**

Let $[c] \in H^2_{Grp}(G,A)$ be a group 2-cocycle.
Choose $c \colon G \times G \to A$ to be a representative of the cohomology class by a normalized cocycle, def. \ref{Normalized2Cocycle}, which can always be done by prop. \ref{EveryGroup2CocycleIsNormalizable}.

Define a group 

$$
  G \times_c A \in Grpd
$$

as follows. 


Let the underlying set of $G \times_c A$ be the [[nLab:cartesian product]] $U(G) \times U(A)$ of the underlying sets of $G$ and $A$. The group operation on this is given by

$$
  (g_1, a_1) \cdot (g_2, a_2)
  \coloneqq
  (g_1 \cdot g_2 ,\; a_1 + a_2 + c(g_1, g_2))

$$


=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

This defines indeed a group: the [[nLab:cocycle]] condition on $c$ gives precisely the  [[nLab:associativity]] of the product on $G \times_c A$.
Moreover, the construction extends to a [[nLab:homomorphism]]

$$
  Rec : H^2_{Grp}(G,A) \to Ext(G,A)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Forming the product of three elements of $G \times_c A$ bracketed to the left is, according to def. \ref{CentralExtensionAssociatedTo2Cocycle},

$$
  \left(
    \left(g_1, a_1\right) \cdot \left(g_2, a_2\right)
  \right)
  \cdot
  \left(
    g_3, a_3
  \right)
 = 
  \left( 
    g_1 g_2 g_3 \;,\; a_1 + a_2 + a_3 
    + 
    c(g_1, g_2) +  c\left(  g_1 g_2, g_3 \right) 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Bracketing the same three elements to the right yields

$$
  \left(g_1, a_1\right) 
   \cdot 
  \left(
     \left(g_2, a_2\right)
     \cdot
   \left(
    g_3, a_3
  \right)
 \right)
 = 
  \left( 
    g_1 g_2 g_3 \;,\; a_1 + a_2 + a_3 
    + 
    c(g_2, g_3) +  c\left(  g_1 , g_2 g_3 \right) 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The difference between the two expressions is read off to be precisely

$$
  (1, (d c) (g_1, g_2, g_3))
 \,,
$$

where $d c$ denotes the group cohomology differential of $c$. Hence this vanishes precisely if $c$ is a group 2-cocycle, hence we have an associative product.

To see that it has inverses, notice that for all $(g,a)$ we have

$$
  (g,a)
  \cdot
  (g^{-1}, - a - c(g,g^{-1}))
  = 
  (e, a - a - c(g,g^{-1})+ c(g,g^{-1}) )
$$

and hence inverses in $G \times_c A$ are given by 

$$
  (g,a)^{-1} = (g^{-1}, -a - c(g,g^{-1}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore $G \times_c A$ is indeed a group. 

Using that $c$ is a normalized cocycle by assumption, we find that the inclusion 

$$
  i \colon A \to G \times_c A
$$

given by $a \mapsto (e,a)$ is a group homomorphism. Moreover, the projection on the underlying sets evidently yields a group homomorphism $p \colon G \times_c A \to G$ given by $(g,a) \mapsto g$. The kernel of this is $A$, and hence 

$$
  A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} G \times_c A \stackrel{p}{\to} G
$$

is indeed a group extension. It is a [[nLab:central extension]] again using the assumption that $c$ is normalized $c(g,e) = c(e,g) = 0$:

$$
  (g,a) \cdot (e,\tilde a) = (g, a + \tilde a + 0) = (e,\tilde a) \cdot (g,a)
  \,.
$$

To see that the construction is independent of the choice of coycle $c$ representing $[c]$, let $\tilde c$ be another representative which differs by a [[nLab:coboundary]] $h \colon G \to A$ with

$$
  \tilde c (g_1,g_2) \coloneqq c(g_1,g_2) - h(g_1) - h(g_2) + h(g_1 g_2)
  \,.
$$

We claim that then we have a homomorphism of central extensions (hence an isomorphism) of the form

$$  
  \array{
     A &\to& G \times_c A &\to& G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}} 
      && 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id_G, p_2 -h \circ p_1)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
     \\
     A &\to& G \times_{\tilde c} A &\to& G
  }
  \,.
$$

To see this we check for all elements that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
   (g_1, a_1 - h(g_1)) \cdot (g_2, a_2 - h(g_2))
   & = 
   (g_1 g_2, a_1 + a_2 - h(g_1) - h(g_2) + c(g_1, g_2))
   \\
   & = 
  (g_1 g_2, a_1 + a_2 + \tilde c(g_1, g_2) - h(g_1 g_2) )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Hence the construction of $G \times_c A$ indeed defines a function $H^2_{Grp}(G,A) \to CentrExt(G,A)$.

**(2-cocycle extracted from central extension)**

Given a central extension $A \to \hat G \to B$ define a group 2-cocycle $c : G \times G \to A$ as follows.

Choose a [[nLab:section]] $\sigma : U(G) \to U(\hat G)$ of the underlying [[nLab:sets]] (which exists by the [[nLab:axiom of choice]] and the fact that $p : \hat G \to G$ is by definition an [[nLab:epimorphism]]). Then define $c$ by

$$
  c
  \colon
  (g_1, g_2) 
    \mapsto
  -\sigma(g_1)^{-1} \sigma(g_2)^{-1} \sigma(g_1 g_2)
  \in A
  \,,
$$

where on the right we are using that by the section-property of $\sigma$ and the group homomorphism property of $p$

$$
  p(\sigma(g_1)^{-1} \sigma(g_2)^{-1} \sigma(g_1 g_2)) = 1
$$

and hence by the exactness of the extension the argument is in $A \hookrightarrow \hat G$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The construction of prop. \ref{2CocycleExtractedFromCentralExtension} indeed yields a 2-cocycle in [[nLab:group cohomology]]. It extends to a morphism

$$
  Extr \colon Ext(G,A) \to H^2_{Grp}(G,A)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The cocycle condition to be checked is that 

$$
  c(g_1, g_2) - c(g_0 g_1, g_2) + c(g_0, g_1 g_2) - c(g_0, g_1)
  = 
  1
$$

for all $g_0, g_1, g_2 \in G$. Writing this out with def. \ref{2CocycleExtractedFromCentralExtension} yields

$$
  \sigma(g_1)^{-1} \sigma(g_2)^{-1} \sigma(g_1 g_2)
  \left(\sigma(g_0 g_1)^{-1} \sigma(g_2)^{-1} \sigma(g_0 g_1 g_2)\right)^{-1}
  \sigma(g_0)^{-1} \sigma(g_1 g_2)^{-1} \sigma(g_0 g_1 g_2)
  \left( \sigma(g_0)^{-1} \sigma(g_1)^{-1} \sigma(g_0 g_1)  \right)^{-1}
  \,.
$$

Here it is sufficient to observe that for every term also the inverse term appears.

To see that this is a well-defined map to $H^2_{grp}(G,A)$ we need to check that for $\tilde \sigma : G \to \hat G$ a different choice of section, the corresponding cocycles differ by a group coboundary $\tilde c - c = d h$. Clearly this is obtained by setting

$$
  h \colon g \mapsto \tilde \sigma(g)\sigma(g)^{-1}
  \,,
$$

where we use that the right hand side is in $A \hookrightarrow \hat G$ since because both $\sigma$ and $\tilde \sigma$ are sections of $p$, the image of the right hand under $p$ is the neutral element in $G$.

###### Proof

Let $[c] \in H^2_{Grp}(G,A)$. Then by construction of $\hat G \coloneqq G \times_c A$ there is a canonical section of the underlying function of sets $U(G \times_c A) \to U(G)$ given by $(id_{U(G)}, 0) U(G) \to U(G) \times U(A)$. The cocycle induced by this section sends

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (g_1, g_2) & \mapsto (g_1, 0) (g_2, 0) (g_1 g_2, 0)^{-1}
    \\
    & = 
    (g_1, 0) (g_1, 0) ((g_1 g_2)^{-1}, - c(g_1 g_2, (g_1 g_2)^{-1}) )
    \\
    & =  (g_1 g_2, c(g_1, g_2) ) ((g_1 g_2)^{-1}, - c(g_1 g_2, (g_1 g_2)^{-1}) )
    \\
    & = (e, c(g_1, g_2) - c(g_1 g_2, (g_1 g_2)^{-1}) + c(g_1 g_2, (g_1 g_2)^{-1}))
   \\
   & = (e, c(g_1, g_2))
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

which is $c(g_1, g_2) \in A \hookrightarrow G \times_c A$, and hence this recovers the 2-cocycle that we started with.



This shows that $Extr \circ Rec = id$ and in particular that $Rec$ is a [[nLab:surjection]]. It is readily seen that the [[nLab:kernel]] of $Rec$ is trivial, and so it is an equivalence.

The central extension of an abelian group $G$ by an abelian group $A$ need not itself be abelian.

=--

But from the above classification we can read off the condition for the extension to be central.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The central extension of an abelian group $G$ is itself abelian if the coresponding cocycle $c \colon G \times G \to A$ is symmetric, in that

$$
  c(g_1, g_2) = c(g_2, g_1)
$$

for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$.

With the general classification of group extensions in hand, we now turn back to the [[nLab:Ext]]-functor. First we discuss a choice of [[nLab:projective resolution]] that yields group cocycles.

###### Definition

For $G$ a [[nLab:group]], the **[[nLab:group ring]]** $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ is the [[nLab:ring]]

1. whose underlying [[nLab:abelian group]] is the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the underlying set of $G$;

1. whose multiplication is given on [[nLab:basis]] elements by the group operation.

for the [[nLab:homomorphism]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]] which forms the sum of $R$-[[nLab:coefficients]] of the [[nLab:formal linear combinations]] that constitute the group ring

$$
  \epsilon \colon r \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} r_g
  \,.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let 

$$
  Q^u_n \coloneqq F(U(G)^{\times^{n}})
$$ 

be the [[nLab:free module]] over the [[nLab:group ring]] $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ on $n$-[[nLab:tuples]] of elements of $G$ (hence $Q^u_0 \simeq \mathbb{Z}[G]$ is the free module on a single generator).

For $n \geq 1$ let $\partial_{n-1} \colon Q^u_n \to Q^u_{n-1}$ be given on [[nLab:basis]] elements by

$$
  \partial_{n-1} (g_1, \cdots, g_n)

$$

where in the first summand we have the coefficient $g_1 \in G \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}[G]$ times the basis element $[g_2, \cdots, g_n]$ in $F(U(G)^{n-1})$.

In particular

$$
  \partial_0 \colon [g] \mapsto g[*] - [*] =  g-e \in \mathbb{Z}[G]

Write furthermore $Q_n$ for the [[nLab:quotient]] module $Q^u_n \to Q^n$ which is the [[nLab:cokernel]] of the inclusion of those elements for which one of the $g_i$ is the unit element.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The construction in def. \ref{ProjectiveResolutionForZAsZGModule} defines [[nLab:chain complexes]] $Q^u_\bullet$ and $Q_\bullet$ of $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-modules. 
Moreover, with the augmentation map of def. \ref{AugmentationMap} these are projective resolutions

$$
  \epsilon \colon Q^u_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} \mathbb{Z}
$$

$$
  \epsilon \colon Q_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} \mathbb{Z}
$$

of $\mathbb{Z}$ equipped with the trivial $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-module structure in $\mathbb{Z}[G]$[[nLab:Mod]].

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

The proof that we have indeed a chain complex is much like the proof of the existence of the [[nLab:alternating face map complex]] of a [[nLab:simplicial group]], because writing

$$
  \partial^0_n [g_1, \cdots, g_n] \coloneqq g_1 [g_2, \cdots, g_n]
$$

$$
  \partial^i_n [g_1, \cdots, g_n] \coloneqq [g_1, \cdots, g_i g_{i+1}, g_{i+2}, \cdots, g_n]
  \;\;
  for 1 \leq i \leq n-1
$$

$$
  \partial_n [g_1, \cdots, g_n] \coloneqq [g_1, \cdots, g_{n-1}]
$$

one finds that these satisfy the [[nLab:simplicial identities]] and that $\partial_n = \sum_{i = 0}^n (-1)^i \partial^i_n$.

That the augmentation map is a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]] is equivalent, by remark \ref{ProjectiveResolutionInComponents}, to the [[nLab:augmentation]]

$$
  \cdots 
  \stackrel{\partial_2}{\to} \mathbb{Z}[G]^2 
  \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to}  
  \mathbb{Z}[G] \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

being an [[nLab:exact sequence]]. In fact we show that it is a [[nLab:split exact sequence]] by constructing for the canonical chain map to the 0-complex a [[nLab:null homotopy]] $s_\bullet$.
To that end, let 

$$
  s_{-1} \colon \mathbb{Z} \to Q^u_0
$$

be given by sending $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ to the single basis element in $Q^u_0 \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}[G][*] \simeq \mathbb{Z}[G]$, and let for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  s_n \colon Q^u_n \to Q^u_{n+1}
$$

be given on basis elements by 

$$
  s_n(g[g_1, \cdots, g_n]) \coloneqq [g, g_1, \cdots, g_n]
  \,.
$$

In the lowest degrees we have

$$
  \epsilon \circ s_{-1} = id_{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

because 

$$
  \epsilon(s_{-1}(1)) = \epsilon([*]) = \epsilon(e) = 1
$$

and

$$
  \partial_0 \circ s_0 + s_{-1}\circ \epsilon = id_{Q^u_0}
$$

because for all $g \in G$ we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial_0 (s_0(g[*])) + s_{-1}(\epsilon(g[*]))
    & = 
    \partial_0( [g] ) + s_{-1}(1)
    \\
    & = g[*] - [*] + [*]
    \\
    & = 
    g[*]
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

For all remaining $n \geq 1$ we find

$$
  \partial_n \circ  s_n + s_{n-1} \circ \partial_{n-1}
  = 
  id_{Q^u_n}
$$

by a lengthy but straightforward computation. This shows that every cycle is a boundary, hence that we have a resolution.

Finally, since the chain complex $Q^u_\bullet$ consists by construction degreewise of [[nLab:free modules]] hence of a [[nLab:projective modules]], it is a [[nLab:projective resolution]].

###### Theorem

For $A$ an [[nLab:abelian group]] equipped with a linear $G$-[[nLab:action]] and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the degree-$n$ [[nLab:group cohomology]] $H^n_{grp}(G, A)$ of $G$ with [[nLab:coefficients]] in $A$ is equivalently given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    H^n_{Grp}(G,A) & \simeq Ext^n_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(\mathbb{Z}, A)
    \\
    & \simeq H^n(Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(Q^u_n, A))
    \\
    & \simeq H^n(Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(Q_n, A))

  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we canonically regard $A \in \mathbb{Z}[G]$[[nLab:Mod]].

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

By the [[nLab:free functor]] [[nLab:adjunction]] we have that 

$$
  Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(F^u_n, A)  
  \simeq
  Hom_{Set}(U(G)^{\times n}, U(A))
$$

is the set of [[nLab:functions]] from $n$-tuples of elements of $G$ to elements of $A$. It is immediate to check that these are in the [[nLab:kernel]] of $Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(\partial_{n}, A)$ precisely if they are [[nLab:cocycles]] in the [[nLab:group cohomology]] (by comparison with the explicit formulas there) and that they are gorup cohomology [[nLab:coboundaries]] precisely if they are in the [[nLab:image]] of $Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}(\partial_{n-1}, A)$. This establishes the first equivalences.

Similarly one finds that $H^n(Hom(F_n, A)))$ is the sub-group of _normalized_ cocycles. By the discussion at _[[nLab:group cohomology]]_ these already support the entire group cohomology (every cocycle is comologous to a normalized one).

=--

This finishes the discussion of the classification of [[nLab:central extensions]] of groups by $Ext^1_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}$. 

Now we discuss the general statement that $Ext^1_{\mathcal{A}}$ classifies extensions in $\mathcal{A}$, hence in particular _abelian extension_ of abelian groups if $\mathcal{A} = $ [[nLab:Ab]].

lifting the identity map on $G$ two a [[nLab:chain map]] between the two resolutions.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The construction of def. \ref{MapFromExtensionsToExtGroup} is indeed well defined in that it is independent of the choice of projective resolution as well as of the choice of chain map between the projective resolutions.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the same projective resolution but another lift $\tilde c$ of the identity.
By prop. \ref{HomotopyUniquenessOfResolutionOfMorphism} any other choice $\tilde c$ fitting into a commuting diagram as above is related by a [[nLab:chain homotopy]] to $c$.

$$
  \array{
     Y_2 &\to& 0 
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_1^{Y}}} &\nearrow_{\eta_1 = 0}& \downarrow
     \\
     Y_1 &\stackrel{c - \tilde c}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_0^Y}} &\nearrow_{\eta_0}& \downarrow
     \\
     Y_0 &\to& \hat G
     \\
     \downarrow &\nearrow_{}& \downarrow
     \\
     G &\to& G
  }
  \,.
$$

The chain homotopy condition here says that 

$$
  c - \tilde c = \eta_0 \circ \partial^{Y}_0 
$$

and hence that in $Hom(Y_\bullet,N)$ we have that $d \eta_0 = c - \tilde c$ is a [[nLab:coboundary]]. Therefore for the given choice of resolution $Y_\bullet$ we have obtained a well-defined map

$$
  Ext(G,A) \to Ext^1(G,A)
  \,.
$$

If moreover $Y'_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} G$ is another projective resolution, with respect to which we define such a map as above, then lifting the identity map on $G$ to a chain map between these resolutions in both directions, by prop. \ref{InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms}, establishes an isomorphism between the resulting maps, and hence the construction is independent also of the choice of resolution.

###### Definition

Define a function 

$$
  Rec \colon Ext^1(G,A) \to Ext(G,A)

as follows. For $Y_\bullet \to G$ a projective resolution of $G$ and $[c] \in Ext^1(G,A) \simeq H^1(Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(F_\bullet,A))$ an element of the $Ext$-group, let

$$

    Y_0
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    G
  }
$$

be a representative. By the commutativity of the top square this restricts to a morphism

$$
  \array{
     Y_1/Y_2 &\stackrel{c}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow 
     \\
     Y_0
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     G
  }
  \,,
$$

where now the left column is itself an extension of $G$ by the [[nLab:cokernel]] $Y_1/Y_2$ (because by exactness the kernel of $Y_1 \to Y_0$ is the image of $Y_2$ so that the kernel of $Y_1/Y_2 \to Y_0$ is zero). Form then the [[nLab:pushout]] of the horizontal map along the two vertical maps. This yields

$$
  \array{
    Y_1/Y_2 &\stackrel{c}{\to}& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_0 &\to& Y_0 \coprod_{Y_1/Y_2} A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    G &\stackrel{id}{\to}& G
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the top right is indeed $G$, by the [[nLab:pasting law]] for pushouts and using that the left vertical composite is the [[nLab:zero morphism]]. Moreover, the top right morphism is indeed a monomorphism as it is the pushout of a map of modules along an [[nLab:injection]]. Similarly the top right morphism is an epimorphism. 

Hence $A \to Y_0 \coprod_{Y_1/Y_2} Y_0 \to G$ is an element in $Ext(G,A)$ which we assign to $c$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The construction of def. \ref{ExtensionFromAnElementOfExt1} is indeed well defined in that it is independent of the choice of projective resolution as well as of the choice of representative of the $Ext$-element.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The coproduct $Y_0 \coprod_{Y_1/Y_2} A$ is equivalently 

$$
  coker(Y_1/Y_2 \stackrel{(incl,-c)}{\to} Y_0 \oplus A)
  \,.
$$

For a different representative $\tilde c$ of $[c]$ there is by construction a

$$
  \array{
     Y_1 &\stackrel{\tilde c - c}{\to}& A
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\partial_0}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\lambda}
     \\
     Y_0
  }
  \,.
$$

Define from this a map between the two cokernels induced by the [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    Y_1/Y_2 &\stackrel{id}{\to}& Y_1/Y_2
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,-c)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,-\tilde c)}}
    \\
    Y_0 \oplus A 
      &\stackrel{\left(\array{ id & 0 \\ \lambda & id }\right)}{\to}& 
    Y_0 \oplus A
  }
  \,.
$$

By construction this respects the inclusion of 
$A \stackrel{(0,id)}{\hookrightarrow} Y_0 \oplus A \to Y_0 \coprod_{Y_1/Y_2} A$. It also manifestly respects the projection to $G$. Therefore this defines a morphism and hence by remark \ref{MorphismOfExtensionIsIsomorphism} even an isomorphism of extensions.

###### Proof

By straightforward unwinding of the definitions.

In one direction, starting with a $c \in Ext^1(G,A)$ and constructing the extension by pushout, the resulting pushout diagram

$$
  \array{
     Y_1 &\stackrel{c}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     Y_0 &\to& Y_0 \coprod^c_{Y_1/Y_2} A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     G &\stackrel{id}{\to}& G
  }
$$

at the same time exhibits $c$ as the cocycle extracted from the extension $A \to Y_0 \coprod^c_{Y_1/Y_2} A \to G$. 

Conversely, when starting with an extension $A \to \hat G \to G$ then extracting a $c$ by a choice of projective resolution and constructing from that another extension by pushout, the [[nLab:universal property]] of the pushout yields a morphism of exensions, which by remark \ref{MorphismOfExtensionIsIsomorphism} is an isomorphism of extensions, hence an equality in $Ext(G,A)$.

This concludes our discussion of the derived Hom-functor  and its relation to [[nLab:extensions]] and [[nLab:group extensions]] in low degree. Of course also the higher $Ext$-groups classify [[nLab:infinity-group extension|higher extensions]], but this we will not discuss here.

###### Proposition

For $p \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \geq 1$, for $\mathbb{Z}_p \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ the [[nLab:cyclic group]] and for $A \in $ [[nLab:Ab]] $\simeq \mathbb{Z}$[[nLab:Mod]] any [[nLab:abelian group]], we have an [[nLab:isomorphism]]

$$
  Tor_1^\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}_p, A)
  \simeq
  {}_p A
  \,.
$$

For $p = 0$ we have

$$
  Tor_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}, A) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement, the [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{mod\, p}{\to}
  \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

constitutes a [[nLab:projective resolution]] (even a [[nLab:free resolution]]) of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Accordingly we have 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Tor_1^\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, A)
    &\simeq
    H_1( [\cdots\to 0 \to \mathbb{Z}\otimes A \stackrel{(\cdot p) \otimes A}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \otimes A )
    \\
    & \simeq
    ker( (\cdot p) \otimes A )
    \\
    & \simeq 
    \{ a\in A | p\cdot a = 0 \}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here in the last step we use that $(\cdot p)\otimes A$ acts as

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (1, a) &\mapsto  (p,a)
    \\
    & = p \cdot (1,a)
    \\
    & = (1, p \cdot a)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The second statement follows since $\mathbb{Z}$ is already free so that $[\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z}]$ is a projective resolution.

###### Proposition

For $N \in R$[[nLab:Mod]], the functor $Tor_n^R(-,N)$ respects [[nLab:direct sums]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $S \in$ [[nLab:Set]] and let $\{N_s\}_{s \in S}$ be an $S$-family of $R$-[[nLab:modules]]. Observe that 

1. if $\{(F_s)_\bullet\}_{s \in S}$ is a family of [[nLab:projective resolutions]], then their degreewise [[nLab:direct sum]] $(\oplus_{s \in S} F)_\bullet$ is a projective resolution of $\oplus_{s \in S} N_s$. 

1. the tensor product functor distributes over direct sums, by prop. \ref{TensorProductDistributes};

1. the [[nLab:chain homology]] functor preserves direct sums.

Using this we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Tor_n^R(\oplus_{s \in S} N_n, N)
    & \simeq
    H_n\left( \left( \left(\oplus_{s \in S} F\right) \otimes  N \right)_\bullet \right)

+-- {: .num_prop #TorOfFiniteAbelianGroup}
###### Proposition

Let $A$ be a [[nLab:finite abelian group]] and $B$ any abelian group. Then
$Tor_1(A,B)$ is a [[nLab:torsion group]].
Specifically, $Tor_1(A,B)$ is a [[nLab:direct sum]] of [[nLab:torsion subgroups]] of $A$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a fundamental fact about [[nLab:finite abelian groups]] (see _[this theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finite+abelian+group#FiniteAbelianGroupIsDirectSumOfCyclics)_), $A$ is a [[nLab:direct sum of abelian groups|direct sum]] of [[nLab:cyclic groups]] $A \simeq \oplus_k \mathbb{Z}_{p_k}$. By prop. \ref{Tor1RespectsDirectSum} $Tor_1$ respects this direct sum, so that

$$
  Tor_1(A,B) \simeq \oplus_k Tor_1(\mathbb{Z}_{p_k}, B)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{TorOutOfCyclicGroup} every direct summand on the right is a torsion group and hence so is the whole direct sum.

=--

In fact this statement is true without assuming finiteness. The full statement is theorem \ref{TorOfAbelianGroup} below, which we come to after preparing a few more properties of $Tor$.


One aspect here is that the order of $A$ and $B$ does not matter:

+-- {: .num_prop #SymmetryOfTor}
###### Proposition

For $N_1, N_2 \in $[[nLab:Ab]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a [[nLab:natural isomorphism]]

$$
  Tor_n(A,B) \simeq Tor_n(B,A)
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence} there is always a [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to F_1 \to F_0 \to N \to 0
$$

exhibiting a [[nLab:projective resolution]] of any module $N$. It follows that $Tor_{n \geq 2}(-,-) = 0$.

Let then $0 \to F_1 \to F_2 \to N_2 \to 0$ be such a short resolution for $N_2$. Then by the long exact sequence of a derived functor, prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence}, this induces an [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  0 \to Tor_1(N_1, F_1) \to Tor_1(N_1, F_0) \to Tor_1(N_1, N_2) \to N_1 \otimes F_1 \to N_1 \otimes F_0 \to N_1 \otimes N_2 \to 0
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{LeftDerivedFunctorOnProjectiveVanishes}, since by construction $F_0$ and $F_1$ are already [[nLab:projective modules]] themselves this collapses to an exact sequence

$$
  0 \to Tor_1(N_1, N_2) \hookrightarrow N_1 \otimes F_1 \to N_1 \otimes F_0 \to N_1 \otimes N_2 \to 0
  \,.
$$

To the last three terms we apply the natural [[nLab:braided monoidal category|symmetric braiding]] in $(R Mod, \otimes_R)$ isomorphism to get 

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& Tor_1(N_1, N_2) &\hookrightarrow& N_1 \otimes F_1 &\to& N_1 \otimes F_0 &\to& N_1 \otimes N_2 &\to& 0
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} 
  && 
    \\ 
    0 &\to& Tor_1(N_2, N_1) &\hookrightarrow& F_1 \otimes N_1 &\to& F_0 \otimes N_1 &\to& N_2 \otimes N_1 &\to& 0
  }
  \,.
$$

This exhibits a morphism $Tor_1(N_1,N_2) \to Tor_1(N_2, N_1)$ as the morphism induced on [[nLab:kernels]] from an isomorphism between two morphisms. Hence this is itself an isomorphism. (This is just by the [[nLab:universal property]] of the [[nLab:kernel]], but one may also think of it as a simple application of the [[nLab:four lemma]]/[[nLab:five lemma]].)

In order to understand more of theorem \ref{TorOfAbelianGroup} we need  to understand the [[nLab:acyclic objects]] of the tensor product functor, def. \ref{AcyclicObject}. These are called the _[[nLab:flat modules]]_.

is an [[nLab:exact functor]], def. \ref{LeftRightExactFunctor}.  

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ImmediateReformulationOfFlatness}
###### Remark

The condition in def. \ref{FlatModule} has the following immediate equivalent reformulations:

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $(-)\otimes_R N$ is a [[nLab:left exact functor]],

   because tensoring with any module is generally already a [[nLab:right exact functor]];

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $(-)\otimes_R N$ sends [[nLab:monomorphisms]] ([[nLab:injections]]) to monomorphisms,

   because for a right exact functor to also be left exact the only remaining condition is that it preserves the monomorphisms on the left of a [[nLab:short exact sequence]];

1. $N$ is flat precisely if the degree-1 [[nLab:Tor]]-[[nLab:functor]] $Tor_1^{R Mod}(-,N)$ is zero,

   because by remark \ref{DerivedFunctorAsObstructionToExactness} $L_1 F$ is the obstruction to a [[nLab:right exact functor]] $F$ being left exact;

1. $N$ is flat precisely if all higher [[nLab:Tor]] functors $Tor_{\geq 1}(R Mod)(-,N)$ are zero,

   by prop. \ref{DerivedFunctorOfExactFunctor};

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $N$ is an [[nLab:acyclic object]] with respect to the tensor product functor;

   because the [[nLab:Tor]] functor is symmetric in both arguments by prop. \ref{SymmetryOfTor} and by definition of acyclic object, def. \ref{AcyclicObject}.

=--

A particularly simple kind of injection of $R$-modules are the injections of [[nLab:finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[nLab:ideals]] 
$I \hookrightarrow R$ into the ring $R$, regarded as a module over itself, by example \ref{RingAsModuleOverItself}. According to remark \ref{ImmediateReformulationOfFlatness} $N$ being flat implies that also $I \otimes_R N \to R \otimes_R N \simeq N$ is a monomorphism. The following theorem says that this is indeed already sufficient to imply that $(-)\otimes_R N$ preserves also all other monomorphisms.

+-- {: .num_theorem #CharacterizationOnIdealInclusions}
###### Theorem

An $R$-module $N$ is flat already if for all inclusions $I \hookrightarrow R$ of a [[nLab:finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[nLab:ideal]] into $R$, regarded as a module over itself, the induced morphism

$$  
  I \otimes_R N \to R \otimes_R N \simeq N
$$

is an injection.

=--

We will not prove this here. But this does imply the following explicit element-wise characterization of flat modules.

+-- {: .num_prop #RelationsFromCharacterizationonIdealInclusion}
###### Proposition

A module $N$ is flat precisely if for every finite [[nLab:linear combination]] of zero, $\sum_i r_i n_i  = 0\in N$ with $\{r_i \in R\}_i$,  $\{n_i \in N\}$ there are elements $\{\tilde n_j \in N\}_j$ and linear combinations

$$
  n_i = \sum_j b_{i j} \tilde n_j \;\;\in  N
$$

with $\{b_{i j} \in R\}_{i,j}$ such that for all $j$ we have linear combinations of 0 in $R$

$$
  \sum_i r_i b_{i j}  = 0\;\;\; \in R
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A finite set $\{r_i \in R\}_i$ corresponds to the inclusion of a finitely generated ideal $I \hookrightarrow R$. 

By theorem \ref{CharacterizationOnIdealInclusions} $N$ is flat precisely if $I \otimes_R N \to N$ is an injecton. This in turn is the case precisely if the only element of the tensor product $I \otimes_R R$ that is 0 in $R \otimes_R N = N$ is already 0 on $I \otimes_R N$.

Now by definition of [[nLab:tensor product of modules]] an element of $I \otimes_R N$ is of the form $\sum_i (r_i ,n_i)$ for some $\{n_i \in N\}$. Under the inclusion $I \otimes_R N \to N$ this maps to the actual linear combination $\sum_i r_i n_i$. This map is injective if whenever this linear combination is 0, already $\sum_i (r_i, n_i)$ is 0.

But the latter is the case precisely if this is equal to a combination $\sum_j (\tilde r_j  , \tilde n_j)$ where all the $\tilde r_j$ are 0. This implies the claim.

=--

By the same kind of reasoning as in the proof of prop. \ref{RelationsFromCharacterizationonIdealInclusion} one finds:

+-- {: .num_prop #LazardCriterion}
###### Proposition
**([[nLab:Lazard's criterion]])**

A module is flat if and only if it is a [[nLab:filtered colimit]] of [[nLab:free modules]]. 

=--

Using this we can now show the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #TorPreservesFilteredColimits}
###### Proposition

For $N \in R Mod$ a module and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the functor 

$$
  Tor_n^R(-,N) \colon R Mod \to R Mod
$$

respects [[nLab:filtered colimits]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let hence $A \colon I \to R Mod$ be a [[nLab:filtered category|filtered]] [[nLab:diagram]] of modules. For each $A_i$, $i \in I$ we may find a [[nLab:projective resolution]] and in fact a [[nLab:free resolution]] $(Y_i)_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} A$. Since [[nLab:chain homology]] commutes with filtered colimits (this is discussed at _[chain homology - respect for filtered colimits](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/chain+homology+and+cohomology#RespectForDirectSum)_), this means that 

$$
  (\underset{\to_i}{\lim} Y_i)_\bullet \to A
$$

is still a [[nLab:quasi-isomorphism]]. Moreover, by [[nLab:Lazard's criterion]], def. \ref{LazardCriterion} the degreewise filtered colimits of [[nLab:projective modules]] $\underset{\to_i}{\lim} (Y_i)_n$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are [[nLab:flat modules]]. This means that $\underset{\to_i}{\lim} (Y_i)_\bullet \to A$ is [[nLab:flat resolution]] of $A$. By remark \ref{ImmediateReformulationOfFlatness} this means that it is a $(-)\otimes N$-[[nLab:acyclic resolution]]. Then by example \ref{FAcyclicObjectsAreFProjectiveObjects} and theorem \ref{DerivedFFromFInjectiveResolution} it follows that 

$$
  Tor_n^\mathbb{Z}(A,N)
  \simeq
  H_n( (\underset{\to_i}{\lim} Y_i) \otimes N )
  \,.
$$

Now the [[nLab:tensor product of modules]] is a [[nLab:left adjoint]] [[nLab:functor]] (the [[nLab:right adjoint]] being the [[nLab:internal hom]] of modules) and so it commutes over the filtered colimit to yield, using again that [[nLab:chain homology]] commutes with filtered colimits,

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \cdots 
    & 
    \simeq 
    H_n( \underset{\to_i}{\lim} (Y_i \otimes N) )
    \\
    & \simeq
   \underset{\to_i}{\lim} H_n( Y_i \otimes N )   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\to_i}{\lim} Tor_n( A_i, N)
 \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Theorem

For $A, B \in $ [[nLab:Ab]], $Tor_1(A,B)$ is a torsion group which is a [[nLab:filtered colimit]] of [[nLab:direct sums]] of [[nLab:torsion subgroups]] of either $A$ or $B$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The group $A$ may be expressed as a [[nLab:filtered colimit]] 

$$
  A \simeq \underset{\to_i}{\lim} A_i
$$

of all its finitely generated [[nLab:subgroups]] (this is discussed at _[Mod - Limits and colimits](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Mod#LimitsAndColimits)_). Each of these is a [[nLab:direct sum]] of [[nLab:cyclic groups]]. 

By prop. \ref{TorPreservesFilteredColimits} $Tor_1^\mathbb{Z}(-,B)$ preserves these colimits. By prop. \ref{TorOutOfCyclicGroup} every summand is sent to a torsion subgroup (of either $A$ or $B$).  Therefore by prop. \ref{TorOutOfCyclicGroup} $Tor_1(A,

B)$ is a filtered colimit of direct sums of torsion groups. This is itself a torsion group.
