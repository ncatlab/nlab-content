## Idea

The classical and motivating examples of a [[homotopy spectral sequence]] is the [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence]] which computes [[homotopy groups]] of a [[topological space]]/[[simplicial set]]/[[homotopy type]] realized as the [[totalization]] of a [[cosimplicial homotopy type]]. It may be regarded as the unstable analog of the [[Adams spectral sequence]], which computes homotopy groups of certain [[spectra]]. The corresponding [[spectral sequence]] for [[homology groups]] of the totalization of a [[cosimplicial homotopy type]] is the [[Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence]].
