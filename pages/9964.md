## Idea

The notion of _[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[tensor category]]_ may be thought of as a [[categorification]] of the notion of  [[commutative ring]], a _2-ring_ or [[2-algebra]]. 

Now the notion of _super 2-algebra_ is accordingly supposed to be the notion categorifying [[super algebra]].
