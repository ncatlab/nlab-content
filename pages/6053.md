## Idea

The _Drinfel'd double_ or _quantum double_ construction is a construction that sends a [[Hopf algebra]] to a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra]] ([Drinfeld 87](#Drinfeld87)). Or more generally, it sends a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] to a [[quasi-triangulated quasi-Hopf algebra]] ([Majid 94](#Majid)).

Geometrically, if the given [[Hopf algebra]] is the [[group algebra]] of a [[finite group]] $G$, then the quantum double is the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of the corresponding [[inertia groupoid]] $\mathcal{L}\mathbf{B}G \simeq G//_{ad} G$. More generally, if the given [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] is the [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of a [[group cohomology]] 3-[[cocycle]] $c \colon \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$, then the corresponding quantum double is the [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of the [[inertia groupoid]] equipped with the [[transgression|transgressed]] 2-cocycle ([Willerton 05](#Willerton))



## Definition

Given a [[field]] $k$, __Drinfel'd__ (or Drinfeld or quantum) __double__ of a finite dimensional Hopf $k$-algebra $H$ is the tensor product algebra $D(H) = H\otimes H^*$ where $H^* = Hom_k(H, k)$ with induced canonical Hopf algebra structure. It appears that the canonical element in $D(H)$ (the image of the identity under the isomorphism $Hom_k(H,H) \cong H\otimes H^*$) is a universal $R$-element in $D(H)$ making it into a [[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]], which is making it "almost commutative". 

This quasitriangular structure in some infinite-dimensional versions of the construction is related to the quasitriangular structure on some [[quantum groups]]. 

## Properties

### Relation to Yetter-Drinfeld modules


The [[category of modules]] over a quantum double of a Hopf algebra $H$ is equivalent to the category of [[Yetter-Drinfeld modules]] of $H$-

### Relation to Drinfeld center

For $H$ a [[Hopf algebra]] arising as the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of a finite [[groupoid]], the [[category of modules]] of its Drinfeld double is equivalently the [[Drinfeld center]] of the category of modules of the original algebra.

More generally, the analog of this statement holds for [[orbifolds]] ([Hinich 05](#Hinich)).

Essentially the same conclusion (with similar motivation and in terms of equivariant fibres of monoidal fibered categories with orbifolds encoded as internal groupoid objects in the base) was independently obtained by [[Zoran Škoda]] at MPI Bonn in 2004 (unpublished).
