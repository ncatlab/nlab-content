Given a [[field]] $k$, Drinfel'd double of Drinfeld double of a finite dimensional Hopf $k$-algebra $H$ is the tensor product algebra $D(H) = H\otimes H^*$ where $H^* = Hom_k(H, k)$ with induced canonical Hopf algebra structure. It appears that the canonical element in $D(H)$ (the image of the identity under the isomorphism $Hom_k(H,H) \cong H\otimes H^*$ is a universal $R$-element in $D(H)$ making it into a quasitriangular Hopf algebra, which is making it "almost commutative". This quasitriangular structure in some infinite-dimensional versions is related to quasitriangular structure on some [[quantum group]]s.
