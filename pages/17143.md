## Statement

For $E$ a [[homotopy commutative ring spectrum]], there is a bijection between [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] on $E$ and homotopy ring spectrum homomorphism $MU \longrightarrow E$ from [[MU]].

Hence $MU$ is the universal [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].

+-- {: .num_lemma #SphereBundleBunminus1}
###### Lemma

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[fiber sequence]] ([prop.](classifying+space#SphereFibrationOverInclusionOfClassifyingSpaces))

$$
  \array{
    S^{2n-1} &\longrightarrow& B U(n-1)
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && B U(n)
  }
$$

exhibits $B U(n-1)$ as the [[sphere bundle]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex vector bundle]] over $B U(n)$.


=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

When exhibited by a fibration, here the vertical morphism is equivalently the quotient map

$$
 (E U(n))/U(n-1) \longrightarrow (E U(n))/U(n)
$$

(by the proof of [this prop.](classifying+space#SphereFibrationOverInclusionOfClassifyingSpaces)).

Now the [[universal principal bundle]] $E U(n)$ is ([def.](classifying+space#EOn)) equivalently the colimit 

$$
  E U(n) \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k  U(k)/U(k-n)
  \,.
$$

Here each [[Stiefel manifold]]/[[coset spaces]] $U(k)/U(k-n)$ is equivalently the space of (complex) $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^k$ that are equipped with an orthonormal (hermitian) [[linear basis]]. The [[universal vector bundle]] 

$$
  E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n 
    \simeq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k  U(k)/U(k-n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n
$$

has as fiber precisely the linear span of any such choice of basis.


While the quotient $U(k)/(U(n-k)\times U(n))$ (the [[Grassmannian]]) divides out the entire choice of basis, the quotient $U(k)/(U(n-k) \times U(n-1))$ leaves the choice of precisly one unit vector. This is parameterized by the sphere $S^{2n-1}$ which is thereby identified as the unit sphere in the respective fiber of $E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #UniversalComplexVectorBundleThomSpace}
###### Lemma

For $E$ a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, then the $E$-[[reduced cohomology]] of the [[Thom space]] of the complex [[universal vector bundle]] is equivalently the [[relative cohomology]] of $B U(n)$ relative $B U(n-1)$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
    & 
    \simeq
    E^\bullet( B U(n), B U(n-1))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

If $E$ is equipped with the structure of a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] then

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
   \simeq
  c^E_n \cdot (\pi_\bullet(E))[ [ c^E_1, \cdots, c^E_n ] ]
  \,,
$$

where the $c_i$ are the universal $E$-[[Conner-Floyd-Chern classes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

In view of lemma \ref{SphereBundleBunminus1} and using that the disk bundle is homotopy equivalent to the base space we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
    & 
    =
    E^\bullet( D(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n), S(E U(n) 
\underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n) )
    \\
    & \simeq
    E^\bullet( E U(n), B U(n-1))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Regarding the second statement: the Conner-Floyd classes freely generate the $E$-cohomology of $B U(n)$ for all $n$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(n))
  \simeq
  \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c^E_1, \cdots, c^E_n ] ]
  \,.
$$

and the restriction morphism

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(n))
   \longrightarrow
  E^{\bullet}(B U(n-1))
$$

projects out $c_n^E$. Since this is in particular a surjective map, the [[relative cohomology]] $E^\bullet( B U(n), B U(n-1) )$ is just the [[kernel]] of this map.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ThomClassesCFClass}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. Then the $n$th $E$-[[Conner-Floyd-Chern class]]

$$
  c^E_n \in \tilde E(Th( E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ))
$$

(using the identification of lemma \ref{UniversalComplexVectorBundleThomSpace}) is a [[Thom class]] in that its restriction to the Thom space of any fiber is a suspension of a unit in $\pi_0(E)$. 

=--

([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $B U(n)$ is [[connected topological space|connected]], it is sufficient to check the statement over the base point. Since that fixed fiber is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of $n$ complex lines, we may equivalently check that the restriction of $c^E_n$ to the pullback of the universal rank $n$ bundle along

$$
  i \colon B U(1)^n \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

satisfies the required condition. By the [[splitting principle]], that restriction is the product of the $n$-copies of the first $E$-Conner-Floyd-Chern class

$$
  i^\ast c_n \simeq ( (c_1^E)_1 \cdots (c_1^E)_n )
  \,.
$$

Hence it is now sufficient to see that each factor restricts to a unit on the fiber, but that it precisely the condition that $c_1^E$ is a complex orientaton of $E$. In fact by def. \ref{StrictComplexOrientation} the restriction is even to $1 \in \pi_0(E)$.

For the present purpose:

+-- {: .num_defn #StrictComplexOrientation}
###### Definition

For $E$ a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, then
a _[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]]_ on $E$ is a choice of element

$$
 c_1^E \in E^2(B U(1))
$$

in the cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ (given by the infinite [[complex projective space]]) such that its image under the restriction map

$$
  \phi
  \;\colon\;
  \tilde E^2( B U(1) )
    \longrightarrow
  \tilde E^2 (S^2)
    \simeq
  \pi_0(E)
$$

is the unit

$$
  \phi(c_1^E) = 1
  \,.
$$

=--

([Lurie 10, lecture 4, def. 2](#Lurie10))


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Often one just requires that $\phi(c_1^E)$ is _a_ [[unit]], i.e. an invertible element. However we are after identifying $c_1^E$ with the degree-2 component $M U(1) \to E_2$ of homtopy ring spectrum morphisms $M U \to E$, and by unitality these necessarily send $S^2 \to M U(1)$ to the unit $\iota_2 \;\colon\; S^2 \to E$ (up to homotopy).

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #S2SpectrumMapFromComplexOrientation}
###### Lemma

Let $E$ be a [[homotopy commutative ring spectrum]] equipped with a [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] (def. \ref{StrictComplexOrientation}) represented by a map

$$
  c_1^E
  \;\colon\;
  B U(1)
    \longrightarrow
  E_2
  \,.
$$

Write $\{c^E_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ for the induced [[Conner-Floyd-Chern classes]]. Then there exists a morphism of $S^2$-[[sequential spectra]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-1#SequentialTSpectra))

$$
  M U \longrightarrow E
$$

whose component map $M U_{2n} \longrightarrow E_{2n}$ represents $c_n^E$ (under the identification of lemma \ref{UniversalComplexVectorBundleThomSpace}), for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the standard model of [[MU]] as a sequential $S^2$-spectrum with component spaces the [[Thom spaces]] of the complex [[universal vector bundle]]

$$
  M U_{2n}
    \coloneqq
  Th( E U(n) \underset{}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n)
  \,.
$$

Notice that this is a [[CW-spectrum]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-1#CWSpectrum), [lemma](Thom+space#ThomSpaceCWStructure)).

In order to get a homomorphism of $S^2$-[[sequential spectra]], we need to find representatives $f _{2n} \;\colon\; M U_{2n} \longrightarrow E_{2n}$ of $c^E_n$ such that all the squares

$$
  \array{
    S^2 \wedge M U_{2n}
      &\overset{id \wedge f_{2n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^2 \wedge E_{2n}
    \\
    \downarrow
      && 
    \downarrow
    \\
    M U_{2(n+1)}
      &\underset{f_{2(n+1)}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_{2n+1}
  }
$$

commute strictly (not just up to homotopy). 

To begin with, the map

$$
  f_0 \;\colon\; M U_0 \simeq \ast \longrightarrow E_0
$$

is uniquely fixed. Assume then by [[induction]] that maps $f_{2k}$ have been found for $k \leq n$. Observe that we have a homotopy-commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^2 \wedge M U_{2n} 
      &\overset{id \wedge f_{2n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^2 \wedge E_{2n}
    \\
    \downarrow
      &\swArrow& 
    \downarrow
    \\
    M U_{2} \wedge M U_{2 n}
      &\overset{c_1 \wedge c_{n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_2 \wedge E_{2n}
    \\
    \downarrow
      &\swArrow&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{2,2n}}}
    \\
    M U_{2(n+1)}
      &\underset{c_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_{2(n+1)}
  }
  \,,
$$

where the maps denoted $c_k$ are any representatives of the Chern classes of the same name. Here the homotopy in the top square exhibits the fact that $c_1^E$ is a complex orientation, while the homotopy in the bottom square exhibits the Whitney sum formula for Chern classes ([prop.](Chern+class#WhitneySumChernClasses)).

Now since $M U$ is a [[CW-spectrum]], the total left vertical morphism here is a (Serre-)cofibration, hence a [[Hurewicz cofibration]], hence satisfies the [[homotopy extension property]]. This means precisely that we may find a map $f_{2n+1} \colon M U_{2(n+1)} \longrightarrow E_{2(n+1)}$ homotopic to the given representative $c_{n+1}$ such that the required square commutes strictly.

###### Lemma

For $E$ a [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex oriented]] [[homotopy commutative ring spectrum]], the morphism of spectra

$$
  c \;\colon\; M U \longrightarrow E
$$

that represents the complex orientation by lemma \ref{S2SpectrumMapFromComplexOrientation} is a [[homomorphism]] of [[homotop commutative ring spectra]].

=--

([Lurie 10, lecture 6, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The unitality condition demands that the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{S} \overset{}{\longrightarrow} M U
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c}}
    \\
    && E
  }
$$

commutes in the [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(Spectra)$. In components this means that 

$$
  \array{
    S^{2n} \overset{}{\longrightarrow} M U_{2n}
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c_n}}
    \\
    && E_{2n}
  }
$$

commutes up to homotopy, hence that the restriction of $c_n$ to a fiber is the $2n$-fold suspension of the unit of $E_{2n}$. This is the statement of prop. \ref{ThomClassesCFClass}.

The respect for the product demands that the square

$$
  \array{
    M U \wedge M U
      &\overset{c \wedge c}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \wedge E
    \\
    \downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow
    \\
    M U 
      &\underset{c}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
  }
$$

commutes in the [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(Spectra)$. In order to rephrase this as a condition on ring spectra incarnated as [[functor with smash product]], regard this as happening in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] $Ho(OrthSpec(Top_{cg}))_{stable}$ of the [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]], which is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[stable homotopy category]]  ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#SequentialSpectraQuillenEquivalence)).

Here the derived [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] is given by [[Day convolution]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#SsymModuleSymmetricSpectra)) and maps out of such a product are equivalently as in the above diagram is equivalent ([cor](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#DayConvolutionViaNaturalIsosInvolvingExternalTensorAndTensor)) to a suitably equivariant collection diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    M U_{2 n_1} \wedge M U_{2 n_2}
      &\overset{c_{n_1} \wedge c_{n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_{2 n_1} \wedge E_{2 n_2}
    \\
    \downarrow 
      &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    M U_{2(n_1 + n_2)}
      &\underset{c_{n_1 + n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
   E_{2 (n_1 + n_2)}
  }
  \,.
$$

That this indeed commutes up to homotopy is the Whitney sum formula for Chern classes ([prop.](Chern+class#WhitneySumChernClasses)).

=--


Hence complex orientations map to morphisms $M U \to E$. Hence the map that takes $M U \to E$ to the complec orientation $M U(1) \to E_2$ is surjective. It remains to see that it is also injective. This follows by the [[splitting principle]] (...)
