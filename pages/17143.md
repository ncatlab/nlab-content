## Statement

For $E$ a [[commutative ring spectrum]]/[[E-infinity ring]], there is a bijection between [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphism $MU \longrightarrow E$ from [[MU]].

(e.g [Lurie 10, lect. 6, theorem 8](#LurieLect6), [Ravenel, chapter 4, lemma 4.1.13](#Ravenel))


Hence $MU$ is the universal [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].
