## Statement

For $E$ a [[homotopy commutative ring spectrum]], there is a bijection between [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] on $E$ and homotopy ring spectrum homomorphism $MU \longrightarrow E$ from [[MU]].

Hence $MU$ is the universal [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].


(e.g [Lurie 10, lect. 6, theorem 8](#LurieLect6), [Ravenel, chapter 4, lemma 4.1.13](#Ravenel))

## Details

For the present purpose:

###### Definition

For $E$ a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, then
a _[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]]_ on $E$ is a choice of element

$$
 c_1^E \in E^2(B U(1))
$$

in the cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ (given by the infinite [[complex projective space]]) such that its image under the restriction map

$$
  \phi
  \;\colon\;
  \tilde E^2( B U(1) )
    \longrightarrow
  \tilde E^2 (S^2)
    \simeq
  \pi_0(E)
$$

is the unit

$$
  \phi(c_1^E) = 1
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Often one just requires that $\phi(c_1^E)$ is _a_ unit, i.e. an invertible element. However we are after identifying $c_1^E$ with the degree-2 component $M U(1) \to E_2$ of homtopy ring spectrum morphisms $M U \to E$, and by unitality these necessarily send $S^2 \to M U(1)$ to the unit $S^2 \to E$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #SphereBundleBunminus1}
###### Lemma

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[fiber sequence]] ([prop.](classifying+space#SphereFibrationOverInclusionOfClassifyingSpaces))

$$
  \array{
    S^{2n-1} &\longrightarrow& B U(n-1)
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && B U(n)
  }
$$

exhibits $B U(n-1)$ as the [[sphere bundle]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex vector bundle]] over $B U(n)$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

When exhibited by a fibration, here the vertical morphism is equivalently the quotient map

$$
 (E U(n))/U(n-1) \longrightarrow (E U(n))/U(n)
$$

(by the proof of [this prop.](classifying+space#SphereFibrationOverInclusionOfClassifyingSpaces)).

Now the [[universal principal bundle]] $E U(n)$ is ([def.](classifying+space#EOn)) equivalently the colimit 

$$
  E U(n) \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k  U(k)/U(k-n)
  \,.
$$

Here each [[Stiefel manifold]]/[[coset spaces]] $U(k)/U(k-n)$ is equivalently the space of (complex) $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^k$ that are equipped with an orthonormal (hermitian) [[linear basis]]. The [[universal vector bundle]] 

$$
  E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n 
    \simeq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k  U(k)/U(k-n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n
$$

has as fiber precisely the linear span of any such choice of basis.


While the quotient $U(k)/(U(n-k)\times U(n))$ (the [[Grassmannian]]) divides out the entire choice of basis, the quotient $U(k)/(U(n-k) \times U(n-1))$ leaves the choice of precisly one unit vector. This is parameterized by the sphere $S^{2n-1}$ which is thereby identified as the unit sphere in the respective fiber of $E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #UniversalComplexVectorBundleThomSpace}
###### Lemma

For $E$ a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, then the $E$-[[reduced cohomology]] of the [[Thom space]] of the complex [[universal vector bundle]] is equivalently the [[relative cohomology]] of $B U(n)$ relative $B U(n-1)$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
    & 
    \simeq
    E^\bullet( B U(n), B U(n-1))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

If $E$ is equipped with the structure of a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] then

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
   \simeq
  c^E_n \cdot (\pi_\bullet(E))[ [ c^E_1, \cdots, c^E_n ] ]
  \,,
$$

where the $c_i$ are the universal $E$-[[Conner-Floyd-Chern classes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

In view of lemma \ref{SphereBundleBunminus1} and using that the disk bundle is homotopy equivalent to the base space we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet( Th(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ) )
    & 
    =
    E^\bullet( D(E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n), S(E U(n) 
\underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n) )
    \\
    & \simeq
    E^\bullet( E U(n), B U(n-1))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Regarding the second statement: the Conner-Floyd classes freely generate the $E$-cohomology of $B U(n)$ for all $n$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(n))
  \simeq
  \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c^E_1, \cdots, c^E_n ] ]
  \,.
$$

and the restriction morphism

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(n))
   \longrightarrow
  E^{\bullet}(B U(n-1))
$$

projects out $c_n^E$. Since this is in particular a surjective map, the [[relative cohomology]] $E^\bullet( B U(n), B U(n-1) )$ is just the [[kernel]] of this map.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ThomClassesCFClass}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. Then the $n$th $E$-[[Conner-Floyd-Chern class]]

$$
  c^E_n \in \tilde E(Th( E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n ))
$$

(using the identification of lemma \ref{UniversalComplexVectorBundleThomSpace}) is a [[Thom class]] in that its restriction to the Thom space of any fiber is a suspension of a unit in $\pi_0(E)$. 

=--

([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $B U(n)$ is [[connected topological space|connected]], it is sufficient to check the statement over the base point. Since that fixed fiber is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of $n$ complex lines, we may equivalently check that the restriction of $c^E_n$ to the pullback of the universal rank $n$ bundle along

$$
  i \colon B U(1)^n \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

satisfies the required condition. By the [[splitting principle]], that restriction is the product of the $n$-copies of the first $E$-Conner-Floyd-Chern class

$$
  i^\ast c_n \simeq ( (c_1^E)_1 \cdots (c_1^E)_n )
  \,.
$$

Hence it is now sufficient to see that each factor restricts to a unit on the fiber, but that it precisely the condition that $c_1^E$ is a complex orientaton of $E$. In fact by def. \ref{StrictComplexOrientation} the restriction is even to $1 \in \pi_0(E)$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $c_1^E \in \tilde E^2(B U(1))$ any choice of complex orientation according to def. \ref{StrictComplexOrientation}, then the representing morphism

$$
  M U(1) \longrightarrow E_2
$$

extends to a morphism of [[homotopy commutative ring spectra]]

$$
  M U \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Take the higher components to be given by the higher [[Conner-Floyd-Chern classes]]

$$
  c_n
    \;\colon\;
  M U(n)
    \longrightarrow
  E_{2n}
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{ThomClassesCFClass} this is unital. By the law for Chern classes ... it is multiplicative

$$
  \array{
    M U (n_1) \wedge M U(n_2)
      &\overset{c_{n_1} \wedge c_{n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_{2 n_1} \wedge E_{2 n_2}
    \\
    \downarrow 
      &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    M U(n_1 + n_2)
      &\underset{c_{n_1 + n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
   E_{2 (n_1 + n_2)}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

([Lurie 10, lecture 6, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

Hence complex orientations map to morphisms $M U \to E$. Hence the map that takes $M U \to E$ to the complec orientation $M U(1) \to E_2$ is surjective. It remains to see that it is also injective. This follows by the [[splitting principle]] (...)
