## Statement

For $E$ a [[commutative ring spectrum]]/[[E-infinity ring]], there is a bijection between [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphism $MU \longrightarrow E$ from [[MU]].

Hence $MU$ is the universal [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].


(e.g [Lurie 10, lect. 6, theorem 8](#LurieLect6), [Ravenel, chapter 4, lemma 4.1.13](#Ravenel))

**Proof strategy:** Use that for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the $n$-th $E$-[[generalized Chern class]], thought of as an $E$-[[Thom class]] represented by $c_n \in E^\bullet(M U(n))$, corresponds to a morphism $\phi_n \colon M U(n) \longrightarrow E$. Check that these maps are compatible under restriction. Then unse the [[Milnor exact sequence]] and observe the vanishing of its [[lim^1]]-term to conclude a total map $\phi \colon M U \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n M U(n) \longrightarrow E$.
This component-wise construction of $\phi$ then also serves to show that it is a morphism of [[ring spectra]] and, via the [[splitting principle]], that this is essentially unique.
