## Idea

An _atlas_ is a compatible collection of [[coordinate chart]]s.


## Definition

In full generality, for $\mathcal{G}$ a [[pregeometry for structured (∞,1)-toposes|pregeometry]] and $X \in Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\mathcal{G})$ an object in the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]], an **atlas** for $X$ is a collection of suitable morphisms ([[open maps]]) $\{U_i \to X\}$ with $U_i \in \mathcal{G} \hookrightarrow Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\mathcal{G})$, such that the morphism out of the [[coproduct]]

$$
  \coprod_i U_i \to X
$$

is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]].


## Examples

### For manifolds

* [[manifold]]

### For geometric stacks

* [[geometric stack]]
