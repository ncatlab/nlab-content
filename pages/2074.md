The [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] $SSet^+/S$ of [[marked simplicial set]]s sitting over a given [[simplicial set]] $S$ is a model for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[cartesian fibration]]s over $S$.

The $(\infty,1)$-categorical [[Grothendieck construction]] that exhibits the correspondence between [[cartesian fibration]]s and [[(∞,1)-presheaf|(∞,1)-presheaves]] is in turn modeled by a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the model structure on marked simplicial over-sets and the projective [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].


# Definition #

The **model structure on marked simplicial over-sets** $Set^+/S$ over $S \in SSet$ -- also called the **Cartesian model structure** since it models [[cartesian fibration]]s -- is defined as follows.

A morphism $f : S \to S'$ of [[marked simplicial set]]s is 

* a _cofibration_ if the underlying morphism of [[simplicial set]]s is a cofibration in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] (i.e. a [[monomorphism]]).

  (def. 3.1.2.2 of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]])

* a weak equivalence ...
