## Idea

A **surface** is a [[space]] of [[dimension]] 2.

In [[differential geometry]] this means a 2-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] or something thereby [[parametrization|parametrized]].

In [[complex analytic geometry]] this usually means a [[complex manifold]] of _complex_ dimension 2.

Similarly and more generally, in [[algebraic geometry]] an _[[algebraic surface]]_ is a [[variety]] of algebraic dimension 2.
