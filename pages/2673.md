## Idea

The [[action functional]] of [[gravity]] was originally conceived as a [[functional]] on the space of [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]]s of a [[manifold]] $X$. Later on it was realized that it may alternatively naturally be thought of as a functional on the space of [[connection on a bundle|connections]] with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] -- essentially the [[Levi-Civita connection]]. This is known as the **first order formalism** or the **Palatini formalism**. The [[field strength]] of gravity -- the [[Riemann tensor]] -- is the [[curvature]] of [[Levi-Civita connection]]. Typically this is referred to a [[spin connection]] in this context.

The first order formalism is also the formalism in which [[supergravity]] has to be formulated.
