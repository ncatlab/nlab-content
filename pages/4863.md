## Idea

The _Kaluza-Klein mechanism_ is the observation that pure [[gravity]] on a product [[spacetime]] $X \times F$ with fixed [[metric]] $g_F$ on $F$ looks on $X$ like gravity coupled to [[Yang-Mills theory]] for [[gauge group]] $G$ the [[Lie group]] of [[isometries]] of $(F,g_F)$.

### The mechanism

More precisely, the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional

$$
  g_{X \times F}
   \mapsto S_{EH}(g_{X \times F})
   = \int_{X \times F} R(g_{X \times F}) dvol(g_{X \times F})
$$

restricted to metrics of the special form

$$
  (g^{KK}_{X \times F}(x,f) \in Sym^2(\Gamma(T^* X \times F)) 
  =
    \left(
    \array{
      g_F(f) & A^a(x)k_a
      \\
      A^a(x) k_a & g_X(x)
    }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $\{k_a \in \Gamma(T F)\}$ are a basis for the [[Killing vector field]]s of $(F,g_F)$ is equivalently rewritten as

$$
  S_{EH}(g^KK_{X \times F}) = S_{EH}(g_X) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}(g_F)
  \,,
$$

where 

* the first term is the EH action of $g_X$ on $X$ 

* and the second term is the action functional of [[Yang-Mills theory]] for the [[connection on a bundle|connection]] [[Lie algebra-valued 1-form]] $A$ with values in the Lie algebra of the [[isometry]] [[Lie group]] $G$ of $(F,g_F)$.

* The last term is regarded as a functional on the [[moduli space]] of this ansatz: the space of metrics on the fiber.

More generally, one observes that the infinitesimal transformation of metrics $g_{X \times F}$ of the above form under [[diffeomorphism]]s generated by a Killing vector field $ (x,f) \mapsto \lambda^a(x) k_a(f)$ is on the $A$-component of the form

$$
  A \mapsto d_X \lambda^a + [\lambda,A]  
  \,.
$$

This is the infintiesimal form of a [[gauge transformation]]: an [[isomorphism]] in the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]]. This means than _every_ functional $(g_{X \times F}) \mapsto S(g_{X\times f})$ that is invariant under [[diffeomorphism]]s will restrict on metrics of the above form to something that looks like an action functional for a [[gauge theory]] of the [[gauge field]] $A$.

All this of course remains true if the product $X \times F$ is generalized to an [[associated bundle]] $E \to X$ with fiber $F$ to a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ (E = P \times_G F), in which case the decomposition of the metric applies locally.

A [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] of this form $(E, g^KK_{E})$ for fixed _moduli_ $g_F$ is called a **Kaluza-Klein compactification** of the [[spacetime]] $E$. One also speaks of the effective spacetime $X$ as being obtained by **dimensional reduction** from the spacetime $E$.

### Its application in theoretical physics

Various evident generalizations of this ansatz can and are being considered. 

Most notably for actual model building in physics it is of interest to consider the case where $g_{X}$ and $A$ are _not_ necessarily constant along the fiber $F$. Typically in applications these fields are expanded in terms of Fourier-modes on $F$. The coefficients of the higher modes appear as _massive fields_ in the effective KK-action functional. The are called the **higher Kaluza-Klein modes** . These masses are inversely proportional to the metric volume of $F$. For physical model building this volume is therefore chosen to be very small, such that it implies that the model does not predict the observation of the quanta of these massive modes in existing accelerator experiements.

On the other hand, the extra moduli fields $g_F$ do not acquire effective masses on $X$ this way. Therefore _plain_ Kaluza-Klein theory is trivially ruled out by experiment: for any choice of $F$ it predicts the observation on $X$ of these massless moduli fields, which however are not being seen in actual accelerator experiments.

Therefore if in a model for fundamental physics the Kaluza-Klein mechanism is invoked as a way to explain the existence of the [[standard model of particle physics]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] from pure [[gravity]] the setup needs to be further generalized: other ingredients of the model need to be introduced that serve to equip the moduli fields with an effective potential with a positive minimum, such that these fields to acquire an effective mass on $X$. 

In physics model building the problem of constructing such a more general KK-model is called the **moduli stabilization problem** . 

## Examples

### Reductions of pure gravity with realistic gauge groups

The [[gauge group]] of the experimentally verified [[standard model of particle physics]] is a quotient of the product of the [[special unitary group]]s $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$ and the [[circle group]] $U(1)$.

In ([Witten](#Witten)) it was observed that the minimal [[dimension]] of a fiber $F$ for the KK-reduction on $F$ to yield gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is 7 . This may be a meaningless numerical coincidence, but might be -- and was regarded as being -- remarkable: because it means that the minimum total dimension of a KK-compactification $X \times F$ that could yield a realistic model of observed physics is $4 + 7 = 11$. This is the uniquely specified dimensional of the maximal [[supergravity]] model: [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

While there are many 7-dimensional manifolds $F$ that do yield the desired gauge group of the standard model, ([Witten](#Witten)) also shows that for none of them the remaining field content of the standard model -- the [[fermion]]s and the [[Higgs field]] -- do come out correctly.

Largely due to this result the pure Kaluza-Klein ansatz is regarded nowadays as a non-viable way to reproduce the standard model of particle physics from a theory pure gravity. But one can further play with the idea and consider more flxible models that still exhibit the essence of KK-reduction in parts. 

### Reductions of type II supergravity

Motivation for further variants of the KK-ansatz has to a large extent come from models in [[string theory]]. During the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, the widely dominant ansatz followed in the higher energy phyisics community is to study 10-dimensional [[type II supergravity]] models KK-reduced on 6-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau space]]s $F$. The advantage of these type II models is that they naturally involve a further [[gauge field]], called the [[RR-field]]. This is modeled by cocycles in [[differential K-theory]] which means that its [[field strength]] $\mathcal{F}$ is an inhomogenous closed [[differential form]] of even or of odd degree. Moreover, restricted to configurations $\mathcal{F}$ of these forms with specified [[cycle]]s in $F$, the moduli part of the KK-reduced action functional

$$ 
  (g^KK, F) \mapsto S_{EH}(g_X) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}(g_F, \mathcal{F})
$$

_does_ produce the previously missing positive potentials for $g_F$ proportional to these cycles of $\mathcal{F}$. So KK-reduction of 10-dimensional supergravities can -- for a suitable ansatz -- cure the old problem of moduli stabilization in KK-theory.

This means that physical model building using the specific ansatz of KK-reduction of type II supergravities on Calabi-Yau fibers reduces to a noteworthy enumerative problem in complex geometry: classify all real 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau spaces with given isometries and given cycles.

While interesting, there are few tools known for performing this classification. The only thing that seems to be clear is that the classification is not sparse: there are many points in this space of choices. Since all this is relevant in model building in [[string theory]], the space of these choices has been termed the [[landscape of string theory vacua]].
