## Idea

The _Kaluza-Klein mechanism_ is the observation that pure [[gravity]] on a product [[spacetime]] $X \times F$ with fixed [[metric]] $g_F$ on $F$ looks on $X$ like gravity coupled to [[Yang-Mills theory]] for [[gauge group]] $G$ the [[Lie group]] of [[isometries]] of $(F,g_F)$.

More precisely, the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional

$$
  g_{X \times F}
   \mapsto \int_{X \times F} R(g_{X \times F}) dvol(g_{X \times F})
$$

restricted to metrics of the special form

$$
  g_{X \times F}(x,f)
  =
    \left(
    \array{
      g_F(f) & A^a(x)k_a
      \\
      A^a(x) k_a & g_X(x)
    }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $\{k_a \in \Gamma(T F)\}$ are [[Killing vector]]s of $(F,g_F)$ is equivalently rewritten as

$$
  S_{EH}(g_X) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}(g_F)
  \,,
$$

where the first term is the EH action of $g_X$ on $X$ and the second term is the action functional of [[Yang-Mills theory]] for the [[connection on a bundle|connection]] [[Lie algebra-valued 1-form]] $A$ with values in Lie algebra of the [[isometry]] [[Lie group]] $G$ of $(F,g_F)$.

More generally, one observes that the infinitesimal transformation of metrics $g_{X \times F}$ of the above form under [[diffeomorphism]]s generated by a Killing vector field $ (x,f) \mapsto \lambda^a(x) k_a(f)$ is on the $A$-component of the form

$$
  A \mapsto d_X \lambda^a + [\lambda,A]  
  \,.
$$

This is the infintiesimal form of a [[gauge transformation]]: an [[isomorphism]] in the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]]. This means than _every_ functional $(g_{X \times F}) \mapsto S(g_{X\times f})$ that is invariant under [[diffeomorphism]]s will restrict to metrics of the above form to something that looks like an action functional for a [[gauge theory]] of the [[gauge field]] $A$.
