## Idea

The _Kaluza-Klein mechanism_ is the observation that pure [[gravity]] on a [[Cartesian product|product]] [[spacetime]] $X \times F$ with fixed [[metric]] $g_F$ on $F$ looks on $X$, as an [[effective field theory]], like [[gravity]] coupled to [[Yang-Mills theory]] -- [[Einstein-Yang-Mills theory]] -- for [[gauge group]] $G$ the [[Lie group]] of [[isometries]] of $(F,g_F)$.  In particular for $F = S^1$ the [[circle]], it yields [[electromagnetism]] coupled to [[gravity]] (and a [[dilaton]]) -- [[Einstein-Maxwell theory]].

### The mechanism

More precisely, the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional on [[pseudo-Riemannian metrics]] on a [[Cartesian product|product]] [[spacetime]] $X \times F$ 

$$
  g_{X \times F}
   \;\mapsto\; 
   S_{EH}(g_{X \times F})
   \;\coloneqq\; 
   \int_{X \times F} R(g_{X \times F}) \, dvol(g_{X \times F})
$$

when restricted to [[pseudo-Riemannian metrics]] of the special form

$$
  \left(g^{KK}_{X \times F} \left(x,f\right) \right)
   \;\in \;
  Sym^2\left(\Gamma\left(T^* X \times F\right)\right) 
   \;=\;
   \left(
    \array{
      g_F(f) & A^a(x)k_a
      \\
      A^a(x) k_a & g_X(x)
    }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $\{k_a \in \Gamma(T F)\}$ are a [[basis]] for the [[Killing vector field]]s of $(F,g_F)$, is equivalently rewritten as

$$
  S_{EH}\left(g^KK_{X \times F}\right) 
   = 
  S_{EH}\left(g_X\right) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}\left(g_F\right)
  \,,
$$

where 

* the first term is the [[Einstein-Hilbert action|EH action]] of $g_X$ on $X$

* and the second term is the [[action functional]] of [[Yang-Mills theory]] for the [[connection on a bundle|connection]] [[Lie algebra-valued 1-form]] $A$ with values in the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[isometry]] [[Lie group]] $G$ of $(F,g_F)$;

* and finally the last term is regarded as a [[functional]] on the [[moduli space]] of this ansatz: the [[moduli space of Riemannian metrics]] on the [[fiber]].

More generally, one observes that the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] transformation of [[Riemannian metric|metrics]] $g_{X \times F}$ of the above form under [[diffeomorphisms]] generated by a [[Killing vector field]] $ (x,f) \mapsto \lambda^a(x) k_a(f)$ is given on the $A$-component as follows:

$$
  \frac{d}{d \epsilon} A  = d_X \lambda^a + [\lambda,A]  
  \,.
$$

This is the infinitesimal form of a [[gauge transformation]]: an [[isomorphism]] in the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]]. This means than _every_ functional $(g_{X \times F}) \mapsto S(g_{X\times F})$ that is invariant under [[diffeomorphisms]] will restrict on metrics of the above form to something that looks like an action functional for a [[gauge theory]] of the [[gauge field]] $A$.

Moreover, all this of course remains true if the [[Cartesian product|product]] $X \times F$ -- which we may think of as the trivial $F$-[[fiber bundle]] over $X$ -- is generalized to any [[associated bundle]] $E \to X$ with [[fiber]] $F$, associated to a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ (hence such that $E = P \times_G F$), in which case the above decomposition of the metric applies locally.

A [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] of this form $\left(E, g^KK_{E}\right)$ for fixed _[[moduli]]_ $g_F$ is called a **Kaluza-Klein compactification** of the [[spacetime]] $E$. One also speaks of the effective spacetime $X$ as being obtained by **dimensional reduction** from the spacetime $E$.

(Beware that the term "compactification" here is vaguely related to but rather different from the use of the term in [[mathematics]], as in _[[one-point compactification]]_ etc.).

### Its application in theoretical physics

Various evident generalizations of this ansatz can and are being considered. 

Most notably for actual [[model building]] in [[physics]] it is of interest to consider the case where $g_{X}$ and $A$ are _not_ necessarily constant along the fiber $F$. Typically in applications these fields are expanded in terms of [[Fourier modes]] on $F$. The [[coefficients]] of the higher modes appear as _[[mass|massive]] [[field (physics)|fields]]_ in the [[effective QFT|effective]] KK-[[action functional]]. They are called the **higher Kaluza-Klein modes** . These masses are inversely proportional to the metric [[volume]] of $F$. For physical [[model building]] this volume is therefore chosen to be very small, such that it implies that the [[model (physics)|model]] does not predict the [[observation]] of the [[quanta]] of these massive modes in existing accelerator [[experiments]] (such as the [[LHC]]).

On the other hand, the extra [[moduli]] [[field (physics)|fields]] $g_F$ do not acquire effective [[masses]] on $X$ this way. Therefore [[model (physics)|models]] in _plain_ Kaluza-Klein theory are trivially ruled out by [[experiment]]: for any choice of $F$ they predicts the [[observation]] on $X$ of these massless [[moduli]] [[field (physics)|fields]], which however are not being seen in actual accelerator [[experiments]].

Therefore if in a [[model (physics)|model]] for fundamental physics the Kaluza-Klein mechanism is invoked as a way to explain the existence of the [[standard model of particle physics]] in [[Yang-Mills theory]] from pure [[gravity]], then the setup needs to be further generalized: other ingredients of the [[model (physics)|model]] need to be introduced that serve to equip the [[moduli]] [[field (physics)|fields]] with an effective [[potential]] with a [[positive number|positive]] [[minimum]], such that these [[field (physics)|fields]] to acquire an effective [[mass]] on $X$. 

In [[physics]] [[model building]] the problem of constructing such a more general KK-[[model (physics)|model]] is called the **[[moduli stabilization]] problem** . (See also at _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_.)

## Examples

### Reductions of pure gravity with realistic gauge groups

The [[gauge group]] of the [[experiment|experimentally]] verified [[standard model of particle physics]] is a [[quotient]] of the [[product]] of the [[special unitary groups]] $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$ and the [[circle group]] $U(1)$.

In ([Witten 81](#Witten81)) it was observed that the minimal [[dimension]] of a [[fiber]] $F$ for the KK-reduction to yield the [[gauge group]] $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is $d_F = 7$ . This may be a meaningless numerical coincidence, but might be -- and was regarded as being -- remarkable: because it means that the minimum total dimension of a KK-compactification $X \times F$ that could yield a realistic model of observed physics is $4 + 7 = 11$. This is the uniquely specified dimensional of the maximal [[supergravity]] model: [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

While there are many 7-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifolds]] $F$ that do yield the desired [[gauge group]] of the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]], ([Witten 81](#Witten81)) also shows that for none of them does the remaining [[field (physics)|field]] content of the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]] -- the [[fermions]] and the [[Higgs field]] -- come out correctly.

Largely due to this result, the original pure Kaluza-Klein ansatz that starts with just pure [[Einstein gravity]] with no other [[field (physics)|fields]]) is nowadays regarded as a non-viable to produce the [[standard model of particle physics]]. But one can further play with the idea and consider more flexible [[model (physics)|models]] that still exhibit the essence of KK-reduction in parts. 

Notably the [[11-dimensional supergravity]] mentioned above contains more [[field (physics)|fields]] than just the field of [[gravity]]. Specifically it contains the [[supergravity C-field]] which is a [[higher gauge theory|higher]] analog of the [[electromagnetic field]]. KK-reductions of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and of its conjectured [[M-theory]] [[UV-completion]] for instance on [[G2-manifold]] fibers turn out to be able to yield [[model (physics)|models]] which come at least very close to the [[standard model of particle physics]]. This we come to [below](#KKReductionOf11dSupergravity).

### Reductions of type II supergravity
 {#ReductionsOfTypeIISupergravity}

Motivation for further variants of the KK-ansatz has to a large extent come from models in [[string theory]]. During the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, the widely dominant ansatz followed in the higher energy phyisics community is to study 10-dimensional [[type II supergravity]] models KK-reduced on 6-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau spaces]] $F$. (See also at _[[supersymmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds]]_.)

The advantage of these type II models is that they naturally involve further [[higher gauge fields]], called the [[B-field]] and the [[RR-field]]. These are modeled by [[cocycles]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] and in [[differential K-theory]], respectively, which means that their [[field strength]] $\mathcal{F}$ is an inhomogenous closed [[differential form]] of even or of odd degree. Moreover, restricted to configurations $\mathcal{F}$ of these forms with specified [[cycles]] in the [[fiber]] $F$, the [[moduli]] part of the KK-reduced action functional

$$ 
  (g^KK, F) \mapsto S_{EH}(g_X) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}(g_F, \mathcal{F})
$$

_does_ produce the previously missing [[positive number|positive]] [[potentials]] for $g_F$ proportional to these cycles of $\mathcal{F}$. So KK-reduction of 10-dimensional supergravities can -- for a suitable ansatz -- cure the old problem of [[moduli stabilization]] in KK-theory.

This means that physical model building using the specific ansatz of KK-reduction of type II supergravities on Calabi-Yau fibers reduces to a noteworthy enumerative problem in [[complex geometry]]: classify all real 6-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] with given [[isometries]] and given [[cycles]].

While interesting, there are few tools known for performing this classification. The only thing that seems to be clear is that the classification is not sparse: there are many points in this space of choices. Since all this is relevant in model building in [[string theory]], the space of these choices has been termed the _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_.

### KK-Reduction of 11d supergravity
 {##KKReductionOf11dSupergravity}

The lift of the [above](#ReductionsOfTypeIISupergravity) reduction of [[type II supergravity]] on [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] to [[M-theory]] is the KK-reduction of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] on [[G2-manifolds]] $X_7$. The role of the [[B-field]] and [[RR-field]] is now played by the [[supergravity C-field]], a [[higher gauge field]] in [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of degree 3+1. For non-vanishing [[field strength]] ("flux") of the [[supergravity C-field]] in the 4d space this is the [[Freund-Rubin compactification]] yielding [[weak G2 holonomy]] on $X_7$.

Such KK-compactification of the form _[[M-theory on G2-manifolds]]_ turn out to yield very detailed and at least semi-realistic [[model (physics)|physics]], see for instance the _[[G2-MSSM]]_ [[model (physics)|modle]].


### Cascades of KK-reductions
 {#CascadedOfKKReductionsFromHolographicBoundaries}

Apart from possibly producing [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]]
interesting [[model (physics)|models]] from [[UV-completion|UV-complete]] fundamental [[theory (physics)|theories]] on higher dimensional [[spacetimes]], KK-reduction generally serves to connect a wide range of [[quantum field theories]] with each other in a way that serves to illuminate their general structure and to map the [[moduli space]] of all of them.

For instance various deep but rather mysterious properties of 4-dimensional [[Yang-Mills theory]] (the central theory of the [[standard model of particle physics]]), or at least of its [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] versions [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]/[[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]], find their natural _geometric_ interpretation by understanding this 4d theory as the KK-compactification of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on a [[torus]] [[fiber]]. Notably the [[Montonen-Olive duality]]/[[S-duality]] of [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] is the [[conformal transformation]] remnant of the compactification torus remaining of the [[conformal field theory|conformal invariant]] of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] (see there for more on this).

At the same time, the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] is itself related to a yet higher dimensional theory, namely to a [[7d Chern-Simons theory]], not by KK-reduction, but by [[AdS-CFT duality]]. But that 7d Chern-Simons theory in turn is the KK-reduction of the 11-dimensional Chern-Simons term in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. Hence all this structure follows again from the maximal dimensional [[supergravity]] theory ([[M-theory]]) if in addition to KK-reduction one also considers [[AdS-CFT]]-boundary relations.

And this process continues further down in [[dimension]]: [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] itself has further KK-reductions to 2-dimensional field theories. After passing to the [[topologically twisted D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|topologically twisted theory]], these are an [[A-model]] and a [[B-model]] [[topological string]] [[TCFT]], respectively. Now what used to be [[S-duality]]/[[Montonen-Olive duality]] in 4d and [[conformal field theory|conformal invariance]] in 6d and topological invariant in 7d and 11d here becomes [[geometric Langlands duality]] in 2d (see there for more on this) and produces [[Donaldson theory]].

Hence by iteratively applying KK-reductions and other [[dualities]] and [[topologically twisted D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|topological twists]], one finds long _cascades_ of different [[quantum field theories]] that all superficially look very different, but which thereby become closely related as different aspects of one single higher dimensional field theory. Not all of these lower dimensional theories can be [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] viable [[model (physics)|models]], but even the superficially "unrealistic" theories such as the  [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] serve, via KK-reduction, to explain and illuminate deep properties of (semi-)realistic theories such as [[super Yang-Mills theory]] in 4d. 

The following table displays parts of this cascade of field theories which are induced from [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] under iterative KK-reduction, [[AdS-CFT duality]] and topological twists. There is another such cascade which starts instead from [[AdS-CFT]] applied to [[type II supergravity]] and then proceeds downward in dimension. This is displayed further below.
