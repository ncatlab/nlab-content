## Idea
 
In the [[first order formulation of gravity]] the field of [[gravity]] is modeled by a [[connection]] with values in the [[Poincaré Lie algebra]]. Such a connection locally decomposes into a $\mathbb{R}^{d,1}$-[[Lie algebra valued 1-form]] called the _[[vielbein]]_ and a [[special orthogonal Lie algebra|so(d,1)]]-[[Lie algebra valued 1-form|valued 1-form]] called the _[[spin connection]]_ piece. 

There is a constraint on this data. Usually the $so(d,1)$-connection is required to be the [[Levi-Civita connection]] corresponding to the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] encoded by the vielbein, hence the unique metric compatible connection with vanishing [[torsion]] but in general non-vanishing curvature.

But to some extent one may instead impose a dual constraint and demand the connection to be the _[[Weitzenböck connection]]_, which has vanishing [[curvature]], but in general non-vanishing [[torsion]]. This formulation of gravity is called _teleparallel gravity_, because by flatness of the connection, its [[parallel transport]] is trivial and hence [[tangent vectors]] at different points of [[spacetime]] may consistently be compared without specifying a [[path groupoid|path]] between them, hence without first [[parallel transport|parallel transporting]] one to the other. This "parallelism at a distance" is what gives teleparallel gravity its name.

At least without coupling to matter, the teleparallel formulation is locally classically equivalent to the ordinary formulation in [[first order formulation of gravity]] in that inserting in the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] for the [[vielbein]]+[[Weitzenböck connection]] the expression of the latter in terms of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] one reaobtains the ordinary [[Einstein equations]].

Despite this equivalence, the map of the formal field content of teleparallel gravity to its physical interpretation has a rather different feel to it than in the ordinary formulation. Where ordinarily the field of gravity does not quite affect the motion of bodies like an ordinary [[force]] in Newtonian physics, but instead by [[curvature]] causing non-trivial [[geodesics]], in the teleparallel description the curvature does vanish just as in newtonian physics, and instead the [[torsion]] of the connection acts like a genuine Newtonian force.
