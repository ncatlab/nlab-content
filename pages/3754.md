# Semifunctors

## Idea

A _semifunctor_ is a [[homomorphism]] between [[semicategories]], like a [[functor]] is a homomorphims between [[categories]].

## Definition

A **semifunctor** $F$ from a [[semicategory]] $C$ to a semicategory $D$ is a map sending each [[object]] $x \in C$ to an object $F(x) \in D$ and each [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in $C$ to morphism $F(f) : F(x) \to F(y)$ in $D$, such that

* $F$ preserves [[composition]]: $F(g\circ f) = F(g)\circ F(f)$ whenever the left-hand side is well-defined.

If $C$ is a [[category]], then $F$ need not preserve its identity morphisms, but this axiom does require that it send them to [[idempotents]] in $D$.

## Examples

A mapping $F$ of a category into another category that sends $id_X$ to a nontrivial idempotent endomorphism of $F(X)$ is a semifunctor but not a functor.

More generally, recall from [[semicategory]] that the forgetful functor $U \colon Cat \to Semicat$ has a [[right adjoint]] $G$, which sends a semicategory to its category of idempotents, or [[Karoubi envelope]].  Thus to give a semifunctor from a category $C$ to a (semi)category $D$ is the same as giving a functor from $C$ to the Karoubi envelope $\bar D$ of $D$ (but beware that this correspondence does not hold for [[natural transformations]]).
