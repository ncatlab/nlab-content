## Idea

In [[particle physics]], what is called the _$V_{cb}-puzzle$_ (see [GJS 19](#GambinoJungSchacht19) for the status as of May 2019) is an [[observation]] about the decay of [[B-mesons]] (by the [[Belle collaboration]] and other [[experiments]]) which implies a value of the element $\left\vert V_{c b}\right\vert$ in the [[CKM matrix]] that differs from the apparent prediction of the [[standard model of particle physics]] with a [[statistical significance]] of about $3 \sigma$. But the [[form factor (QFT)|form factors]] involved in this prediction suffer from theoretical uncertainties of [[quark]] contributions, and further [[lattice QCD]]-computation is expected to be required to clarify the actual prediction of the [[standard model of particle physics]] ([GJS 19, last sentence ](#GambinoJungSchacht19)).

The $V_{c b}$-puzzle is different from, but related to, the [[flavour anomalies]] ([GJS 19 (6)](#GambinoJungSchacht19))
