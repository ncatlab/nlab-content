## Idea

Differentiable maps are the [[morphisms]] in the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[differentiable manifolds]].  As we have a hierarchy of ever more differentiable manifolds, so we have a hierarchy of ever more differentiable maps.  As every more differentiable manifold has an [[underlying]] less differentiable manifold, we may always consider maps that are less differentiable than the manifolds between which they run.


## Definitions

To begin with, let $X$ and $Y$ be [[smooth manifolds]], and let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a [[function]] (between their [[underlying sets]]).

* The map $f$ is __continuous__ or __$C^0$__ if it is a [[continuous map]] between underlying [[topological spaces]].

* The most na√Øve interpretation of 'differentiable' is that $f$ is __differentiable at__ a point $p$ of $X$ if the [[derivative]] $d_p f\colon T_p X \to T_{f(p)} Y$ exists; then $f$ is __differentiable on__ a [[subset]] $I$ of $X$ if $f$ is differentiable at every $p \in I$ and __differentiable__ (tout court) if $f$ is differentiable on all of $X$.  However, this condition by itself is not very useful, and often the term 'differentiable' is used for a stronger condition (continuously differentiable or even smooth).  A differentiable map is necessarily continuous (at least wherever it is differentiable).

* The map $f$ is __continuously differentiable__ or __$C^1$__ if it is differentiable (as above) and the resulting map $d f\colon T X \to T Y$ is [[continuous map|continuous]].  We may also speak of a map that is continuously differentiable at a point or on a subset (and the same goes for the other conditions in the hierarchy).

  At this point, working in infinite-dimensional spaces gives us a variety of notions of when the differential is 'continuous'; see [[continuously differentiable map]] for discussion.

* The map $f$ is __twice differentiable__ if it is differentiable and the derivative of the derivative exists at every point.  A twice differentiable map must be continuously differentiable.  Similarly, $f$ is __twice continuously differentiable__ or __$C^2$__ if it's twice differentiable and the second derivative $d d f$ is continuous.

* By [[recursion]], $f$ is __$n + 1$ times differentiable__ if $f$ is $n$ times differentiable and the $n$th derivative of $f$ is differentiable.  Similarly, $f$ is __$n$ times continuously differentiable__ or __$C^n$__ if $f$ is $n$ times differentiable and the $n$th derivative of $f$ is continuous.

* The map $f$ is __[[smooth map|smooth]]__ or __infinitely differentiable__ or __$C^\infty$__ if it is $n$ times differentiable for all $n$, or equivalently if it is $C^n$ for all $n$.  (There is no difference between infinite differentiability and infinite continuous differentiability.)

* One step higher, we may ask whether $f$ is [[analytic function|analytic]] or $C^\omega$, but this takes us beyond smooth manifolds (to [[analytic manifold]]s).

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[topological manifolds]] but not smooth manifolds, the definitions above still may still make sense up to a certain point.  In general, if $X$ is a $C^{k+1}$-manifold then the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ exists as a $C^k$-manifold, so we can define $n$ times differentiable maps or $C^n$ maps between $C^k$-manifolds whenever $n \leq k$.


## Examples

Let $k$ be a [[natural number]], and consider the function
$$ f_k(x) \coloneqq x^k \sin(1/x) $$
from the [[real line]] to itself, with $f(0) \coloneqq 0$.  Away from $0$, $f_k$ is smooth (even analytic); but at $0$, $f_0$ is not continuous, $f_1$ is continuous but not differentiable, $f_2$ is differentiable but not continuously differentiable, and so on:
*  If $k = 2 n$ is even, then $f_k$ is differentiable $n$ times but not continuously differentiable $n$ times;
*  If $k = 2 n + 1$ is odd, then $f_k$ is continuously differentiable $n$ times but not differentiable $n + 1$ times.
