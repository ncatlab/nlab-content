#Definition#

A **super Lie algebra** over a field $k$ is a [[Lie algebra]] [[internalization|internal]] to the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] $k$-linear [[category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

#Examples#

* [[super Poincare Lie algebra]]

# Higher generalizations #

Just as [[Lie algebra]]s are [[vertical categorification|categorified]] to [[L-infinity algebra]]s and [[L-infinity algebroid]]s, so super Lie algebras categorifie to [[super L-infinity algebra]]s.  A secretly famous example is the

* [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]
