## Idea

A _super Lie algebra_ is the analog of a [[Lie algebra]] in [[superalgebra]]/[[supergeometry]]. 

See also [[supersymmetry]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **super Lie algebra** over a [[field]] $k$ is a [[Lie algebra]] [[internalization|internal]] to the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] $k$-linear [[category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

###### Note

This means that a super Lie algebra is 

1. a [[super vector space]] $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_{even} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_{odd}$;

1. equipped with a bilinear bracket
 
   $$
     [-,-] : \mathfrak{g}\otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}
   $$

   that is _graded_ skew-symmetric: is is skew symmetric on $\mathfrak{g}_{even}$ and _symmetric_ on $\mathfrak{g}_{odd}$.

1. that satisfied the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Jacobi identity:

   $$
     [x, [y, z]] = [[x,y],z] + (-1)^{deg x deg y} [y, [x,z]]
     \,.
   $$

###### Note

Equivalently, a super Lie algebra is a "super-representable" Lie algebra internal to the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[Super∞Grpd]] over the site of [[super point]]s. 

See the discussion at [[superalgebra]] for details on this.

## Examples

* The [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] and various of its polyvector extension are super-extension of the ordinary [[Poincare Lie algebra]]. These are the [[supersymmetry algebra]]s in the strict original sense of the word. 

* [[super q-Schur algebra]]

* higher super Lie algebras

  Just as [[Lie algebra]]s are [[vertical categorification|categorified]] to [[L-infinity algebra]]s and [[L-infinity algebroid]]s, so super Lie algebras categorifie to [[super L-infinity algebra]]s.  A secretly famous example is the

  * [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]], [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]
