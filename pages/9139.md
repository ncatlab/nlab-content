## Idea

In [[gauge theory]] in [[physics]] a [[field (physics)|field configuration]] is modeled, in [[mathematics]]-terminology by a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ on a [[principal bundle]] $P$ (or some [[associated bundle]]). In [[physics]]-terminology the connection $\nabla$ is sometimes called the **gauge potential** (while the [[equivalence class]] of $P$ is called the [[instanton sector]] and the [[curvature]] $F_\nabla$ is called the [[field strength]]).

Specfically in _[[electromagnetism]]_ one also speaks of [[electromagnetic potential]] or _[[vector potential]]_.
