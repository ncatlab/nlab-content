## Definition

For $G$ a [[discrete group]], its **order** is the [[cardinality]] of the underlying [[set]].

## Other meanings

### Order of an element of a group

For $G$ a [[group]] and $g \in G$ an [[element]], the **order** of $g$ is the smallest [[natural number]] $n$ such that the $n$-fold group product of $g$ with itself is the neutral element:

$$
  order(g) \coloneqq min \{ n \in \mathbb{N} | g^n = e\}
  \,.
$$

### Of a group scheme

Sometimes the term ''order'' refers to the [[height of a group scheme|height]] of a ([[group scheme|group]]) [[scheme]] $X$ over a [[field]] (of [[characteristic]] $p$) which is defined to be the dimension of the associated ring of functions $O(X)$ as a $k$-[[vector space]]. Another term for this notion is ''rank''. If this group scheme is moreover [[p-divisible group|p-divisible]] - which means that is is in fact a codirected diagram of [[group scheme|group schemes]] of order $p^{v h}$; in this case $h$ is called the order or height of $X$.
