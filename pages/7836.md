The *oder of a [[group]]* is defined to be its cardinality.

The *oder of an element $g$ of a [[group]]* is defined to be the smallest natural number $n$ such that $g^n=e$ equals the [[unit]] of the group.

Sometimes the term ''order'' refers to the height of a (group) scheme $X$ over a field (of characteristic $p$) which is defined to be the dimension of the associated ring of functions $O(X)$ as a $k$-[[vector space]]. Another term for this notion is ''rank''. If this group scheme is moreover [[p-divisible group|p-divisible]] - which means that is is in fact a codirected diagram of [[group scheme|group schemes]] of order $p^{v h}$; in this case $h$ is called the order or height of $X$.
