__Quantum optics__ is an area of applied quantum mechanics concentrating on nonlinear phenomena and coherence of light and other electromagnetic waves. Main optical devices exploring nonlinear regime are lasers and their variants, e.g. masers. These phenomena are also important in [[quantum computing]] (and quantum information theory in general), plasma fusion research and study of principal questions in quantum mechanics. Quantum optics also studies microscopic quantum and semiclassical models of interaction of light with matter.
