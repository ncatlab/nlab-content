## Idea

A _filtered colimit_ is a suitable category such as [[Set]] is a [[colimit]] of shape such that it commutes with all [[finite limit]]s.



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __filtered colimit__ or **finitely filtered colimit** is a [[colimit]] of a [[functor]] $F\colon D \to C$ where $D$ is a [[filtered category]].  

For $\kappa$ a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] a **$\kappa$-filtered colimit** is one over a $\kappa$-filtered category.


Similarly, a __cofiltered limit__ is a [[limit]] of a functor $F\colon D \to C$ where $D$ is a [[cofiltered category]], or equivalently of a [[contravariant functor]] $F\colon D \to C$ (that is a functor $F\colon D^{op} \to C$) where $D$ is a filtered category.

###### Remark

A cofiltered limit may also be called a __filtered limit__ (although this can be unclear); the respective terms __filtered [[direct limit]]__ and __filtered [[inverse limit]]__ are also popular.

=--

A [[functor]] that preserves all finitely filtered colimits is called a _[[finitary functor]]_ .

###### Remark

For $C$ and $D$ two [[diagram]] categories and

$$
  F : C \times D \to Set
$$

a diagram, there is a canonical morphism

$$
  \lambda
   :
  {\lim_\to}_C {\lim_\leftarrow}_D F
   \to 
  {\lim_\leftarrow}_D {\lim_\to}_C  F
$$

from the [[colimit]] over $C$ of the [[limit]] over $D$ to the limit over $D$ of the colimit over $C$ of $F$:

$\lambda$ is given by a [[cone]], whose components

$$
  \lambda_d : 
    {\lim_\to}_C {\lim_\leftarrow}_D F
     \to
    {\lim_\to}_C  F(-,d)
$$

are in turn given by a [[cocone]] with components

$$
  (\lambda_d)_c : 
    {\lim_\leftarrow}_D F(c,-)
     \to
    {\lim_\to}_C  F(-,d)
   \,.
$$

This finally take to have as components

$$
    {\lim_\leftarrow}_D F(c,d)
     \to   
       F(c,d)
     \to
    {\lim_\to}_C  F(c,d)
  \,.
$$

One checks that this indeed makes all the components be natural and makes the origina morphism exist.

Notice that in general $\lambda$ is _not_ an [[isomorphism]].

###### Definition

We say the [[limit]] ${\lim_\leftarrow}_D F(-,-)$ **[[commuting limit|commutes]]** with the colimit ${\lim_\to}_C F(-,-)$ is the morphism $\lambda$ above is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  {\lim_\to}_C {\lim_\leftarrow}_D F
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  {\lim_\leftarrow}_D {\lim_\to}_C  F
  \,.
$$

###### Propositon

In [[Set]], filtered colimits commute with [[finite limit]]s.

In fact, [[filtered categories]] $C$ are precisely those shapes of [[diagram]] categories such that colimits over them commute with all finite limits.

=--

A detailed components proof of the first part is in [Borceux, theorem I2.13.4](#Borceux).

For more on this see also [[limits and colimits by example]].


According to 1.5 and 1.21 in [[LPAC]], a category has $\kappa$-[[directed colimits]] precisely if it has $\kappa$-filtered ones, and a functor preserves $\kappa$-directed colimits iff it preserves $\kappa$-filtered ones. A proof of this result, following Adamek & Rosicky, may be found [[theorem:directed colimits imply filtered colimits|here]]. 

The fact that directed colimits suffice to obtain all filtered ones may be regarded as a convenience similar to the fact that all [[colimits]] can be constructed from [[coproducts]] and [[coequalizers]].  Of course, a [[duality|dual]] result holds for [[codirected limits]].

### Flat functors and points of presheaf toposes 

Let $C$ be a small category. A functor $F: C \to Set$ is **[[flat functor|flat]]** if it is a filtered colimit of [[representable functor]]s. 

Equivalently, a [[module]] $F: C \to Set$ is flat if and only if the [[tensor product]] 

$$- \otimes_C F: Set^{C^{op}} \to Set$$ 

is [[left exact functor|left exact]]. One may prove as a corollary that if $C$ is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]], $F$ is flat if and only if it is [[left exact functor|left exact]] (preserves finite limits). Since this tensor product is automatically a left adjoint, we have the following basic result: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
######Proposition 

For $C$ a [[small category]], the category of [[point of a topos|topos points]] of the [[presheaf topos]] $Set^{C^{op}}$ (i.e., [[geometric morphism]]s $Set \to Set^{C^{op}}$ and natural transformations between them) is equivalent to the category of flat modules on $C$.

### Description in Set, Grp, Top and alike

Elements in filtered colimits in [[Set]] and [[Grp]] are given as classes of equivalences, so called [[germ]]s. Filtered limits in [[Set]] and [[Top]] are given as families of compatible elements, so called [[thread]]s.


### More

(More was/is to be written here, including an application to [[geometric realization]], relation to [[Diaconescu's theorem]], and perhaps more.) 

## Applications

Filtered colimits are also important in the theory of [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] and [[accessible category|accessible]] categories.  See also [[pro-object]] and [[ind-object]].
