## Definitions

A __filtered colimit__ or **finitely filtered colimit** is a [[colimit]] of a [[functor]] $F\colon D \to C$ where $D$ is a [[filtered category]].  

For $\kappa$ a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] a **$\kappa$-filtered colimit** is one over a $\kappa$-filtered category.


Similarly, a __cofiltered limit__ is a [[limit]] of a functor $F\colon D \to C$ where $D$ is a [[cofiltered category]], or equivalently of a [[contravariant functor]] $F\colon D \to C$ (that is a functor $F\colon D^{op} \to C$) where $D$ is a filtered category.  A cofiltered limit may also be called a __filtered limit__ (although this can be unclear); the respective terms __filtered [[direct limit]]__ and __filtered [[inverse limit]]__ are also popular.


A [[functor]] that preserves all finitely filtered colimits is called [[finitary functor|finitary]].


## Properties {#properties}

One of the reasons filtered colimits are important is that in [[Set]], filtered colimits commute with finite limits (and in fact, the filtered colimits can be characterized as precisely those colimits that commute with all finite limits in $Set$).  

For more on this see also [[limits and colimits by example]].

Filtered colimits are also important in the theory of [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] and [[accessible category|accessible]] categories.  See also [[pro-object]] and [[ind-object]].

According to 1.5 and 1.21 in the book 

* Adamek & Rosicky, _Locally presentable and accessible categories_

a category has $\kappa$-[[directed colimits]] precisely if it has $\kappa$-filtered ones, and a functor preserves $\kappa$-directed colimits iff it preserves $\kappa$-filtered ones.  

The fact that directed colimits suffice to obtain all filtered ones may be regarded as a convenience similar to the fact that all [[colimits]] can be constructed from [[coproducts]] and [[coequalizers]].  Of course, a [[duality|dual]] result holds for [[codirected limits]].
