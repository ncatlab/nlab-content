## Idea

A _modality_ in [[logic]]/[[type theory]] expresses a certain _mode_ (or "moment" as in [Hegel 12](#Hegel12)).

A _modal operator_ or _[[closure operator]]_ $\sharp$ is a map that sends [[types]] $X$ to new types $\sharp X$, satisfying some properties. 

The [[categorical semantics]] of these properties is that $\sharp$ is an [[idempotent monad]]/[[comonad]] on the [[category of contexts]]. 

Equipping plain [[logic]]/[[type theory]] with such modal operators
turns them into _[[modal logic]]_, _[[modal type theory]]_. See there for more details.

This has  a refinement to [[homotopy type theory]], where the [[categorical semantics]] of a _higher modality_ or _homotopy modality_ as an idempotent [[(infinity,1)-monad]] ([Shulman 12](#Shulman)).

## Examples

* [[double negation modality]]

* [[n-truncation modality]]

* [[unit type]] modality, [[empty type]] co-modality

* [[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]

* [[reduction modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]]
