## Idea

A _modality_ in [[philosophy]] and formally in [[formal logic]]/[[type theory]] expresses a certain _mode_ (or "moment" as in [Hegel 12](#Hegel12)) of [[being]].

### In philosophy
 {#IdeaInPhilosophy}

According to ([Kant 1900](#Kant1900)) (see [WP](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie_%28Philosophie%29)) the four "[[category (philosophy)|categories]]" are 

1. Quantity

1. Quality

1. Relation

1. Modality

and the modalities contain the three [[unity of opposites|pairs of opposites]]

* [[possibility]] - impossibility

* [[being]]/[[Dasein]] - [[nothing]]

* [[necessity]] - Zufälligkeit


### In formal logic
 {#InFormalLogic}

In [[formal logic]] and [[type theory]] modalities are formalized by
 _modal operator_ or _[[closure operator]]_ $\sharp$, that send [[propositions]]/[[types]] $X$ to new propositions/types $\sharp X$, satisfying some properties. 

Adding such modalities to [[propositional logic]] or similar produces what is called [[modal logic]]. Here operators that are meant to formalize [[necessity]] and [[possibility]] ([[S4 modal logic]]) are maybe most famous. Adding modalities more generally to [[type theory]] yields _[[modal type theory]]_. See there for more details

The [[categorical semantics]] of these modalities is that $\sharp$ is interpreted an [[idempotent monad]]/[[comonad]] on the [[category of contexts]]. 

This has  a refinement to [[homotopy type theory]], where the [[categorical semantics]] of a _higher modality_ or _homotopy modality_ as an idempotent [[(infinity,1)-monad]] ([Shulman 12](#Shulman)).

## Examples

* [[local modality]], [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]]

* [[double negation modality]]

* [[n-truncation modality]]

* [[unit type]] modality, [[empty type]] co-modality

* [[!-modality]]

* [[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]

* [[reduction modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]]

* [[affine modality]]
