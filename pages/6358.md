A relation between [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[arithmetic]] (= number theory) has been explored much in the work of [[Alain Connes]] and his collaborators, especially Marcolli and Consani. 

Some surveys include

* P. Almeida, _Noncommutative geometry and arithmetics_, Russian Journal of Mathematical Physics __16__, No. 3, 2009, pp. 350â€“362, [doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1061920809030030)
* [[Matilde Marcolli]], _Lectures on arithmetic noncommutative geometry_, [math/0409520](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409520) 

There is also another line of thought in the work Manin-Marcolli on the relation of [[Arakelov geometry]] and noncommutative geometry. Arakelov's geometry is of course, motivated by number theory. 

Independetly, one should also notice that the noncommutative geometry over non-archimedean fields is relevant for [[homological mirror symmetry]] as explored in the works of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and [[Yan Soibelman]].
