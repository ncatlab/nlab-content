In addition to important works of his own, he is well known as proponent of rigorous analysis and pure mathematics in Great Britain which was at the time dominated by so-called [[applied mathematics]], for his fruitful collaborations with Littlewood and Ramanujan and for some influential books including the one on divergent series ([[resummation]] methods) and the popular book "A mathematician's apology" about the mathematical profession and the reasons of mathematicians.
