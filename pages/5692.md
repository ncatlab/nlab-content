## Idea


The _model structure on [[reduced simplicial sets]]_ is a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] 

[[∞Grpd]]${}^{*/}_{\geq 1} \hookrightarrow$ [[∞Grpd]]${}^{*/}$ $\simeq$ [[Top]]${}^{*/}$ 

of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[∞-groupoids]] on those that are [[connected]]. 

By the [[looping and delooping]]-equivalence, this is [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] to the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groups]] and this equivalence is presented by a [[Quillen equivalence]] to the [[model structure on simplicial groups]].


## Definition


+-- {: .num_def }
###### Definition

A _[[reduced simplicial set]]_ is a [[simplicial set]] $S$ with a single vertex:

$$
  S_0 = *
  \,.
$$

Write $sSet_0 \subset $ [[sSet]] for the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[simplicial sets]] on those that are reduced.

###### Proposition



There is a [[model category]] structure on $sSet_0$ whose

* weak equivalences 

* and cofibrations

are those in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

This appears as ([GoerssJardine, ch V, prop. 6.2](GoerssJardine)).


## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The simplicial loop space functor $G$ and the delooping functor $\bar W(-)$ (discussed at [[simplicial group]]) constitute a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  (G \dashv \bar W) : sGr \stackrel{\overset{G}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\bar W}{\to}}
  sSet_0
$$

with the [[model structure on simplicial groups]].

This appears as ([GoerssJardine, ch. V prop. 6.3](#GoerssJardine)).


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Under the [[forgetful functor]] $U : sSet_0 \hookrightarrow sSet$ 

* a fibration $f : X \to Y$ maps to a fibration precisely if it has the [[right lifting property]] against $* \to S^1 := \Delta[1]/ \partial \Delta[1]$;

In particular

* every fibrant object maps to a fibrant object.

The first statment appears as ([GoerssJardine, ch. V, lemma 6.6.](#GoerssJardine)). The second (an immediate consequence) appears as ([GoerssJardine, ch. V, corollary 6.8](#GoerssJardine)).
