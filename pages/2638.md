_Laurent series_ generalize [[Taylor series]] and other [[power series]] by allowing negative indices.  A Laurent series for the function $f(z)$ has the form
$$ f(z) = \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}f_n z^n, $$
where $k$ is merely constrained to be finite and is often negative.
Alternatively, we may write it as
$$ f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f_n z^n ,$$
where all but finitely many of the negatively indexed terms are zero.
