## Idea

_Laurent series_ generalize [[Taylor series]] and other [[power series]] by allowing negative indices.  A Laurent series for the function $f(z)$ has the form
$$ f(z) = \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}f_n z^n, $$
where $k$ is merely constrained to be finite and is often negative.
Alternatively, we may write it as
$$ f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f_n z^n ,$$
where all but finitely many of the negatively indexed terms are zero.

## Properties

### Algebraic closure

+-- {: .num_theorem #Puiseux} 
###### Theorem 
If $K$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] and has [[characteristic]] 0, then the [[algebraic closure]] of the field of Laurent series over $K$ is the field of [[Puiseux series]] over $K$.
