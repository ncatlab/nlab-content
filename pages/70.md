## Idea

The term _$\omega$-category_ is used more or less synonymous with _[[∞-category]]_ , though the two terms appear with different frequency in different parts of the literature.

Originally, $\omega$-categories were introduced as

* [[strict ∞-categories]].

The general concept is that of

* [[weak ∞-categories]].

## Related concepts

* [[∞-groupoid]]

* [[globular set]], [[globular operad]], [[globular theory]]

* [[cellular set]]
