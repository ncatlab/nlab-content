## Definition

The **plane** is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^2$. This is naturally a [[topological space]], a [[manifold]], and a [[smooth manifold]].  If we take one of the axes (traditionally the second) to be imaginary, then this __real plane__ may be identified with the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}^1$.  As a stage for [[Euclidean geometry]], it may be called the __Cartesian plane__, __Euclidean plane__, or __coordinate plane__.
