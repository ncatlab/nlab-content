L-functions are certain meromorphic functions generalizing the Riemann zeta function. They are typically defined by so called L-series which is then meromorphically extended to the complex plane. 

Many L-functions have mutually similar deep features like satisfaction of a functional equation etc. The generalized Riemann conjecture is concerned with zeros of so called Dirichlet's zeta function for which the L-series is complicated from the classical Riemann case by the presence of the additional parameter, the Dirichlet character.

Review of Faltings: The determinant of cohomology in the etale topology
Theta functions can be viewed as the canonical section of the determinant of cohomology. The corresponding notion in the etale topology would be L-series. 
"All known constructions of p-adic L-functions seem to be related to some situation where some etale cohomology has vanishing Euler char.

Would like L-functions of mixed motives. Can we define L-functions for simplicial sheaves in a suitable sense???

[arXiv:1009.0736](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1009.0736) Quantum Statistical Mechanics, L-series and Anabelian Geometry
from arXiv Front: math.NT by Gunther Cornelissen, Matilde Marcolli
It is known that two number fields with the same Dedekind zeta function are
not necessarily isomorphic. The zeta function of a number field can be
interpreted as the partition function of an associated quantum statistical
mechanical system, which is a C*-algebra with a one parameter group of
automorphisms, built from Artin reciprocity. In the first part of this paper,
we prove that isomorphism of number fields is the same as isomorphism of these
associated systems. Considering the systems as noncommutative analogues of
topological spaces, this result can be seen as another version of
Grothendieck's "anabelian" program, much like the Neukirch-Uchida theorem
characterizes isomorphism of number fields by topological isomorphism of their
associated absolute Galois groups. In the second part of the paper, we use
these systems to prove the following. If there is an isomorphism of character
groups (viz., Pontrjagin duals) of the abelianized Galois groups of the two
number fields that induces an equality of all corresponding L-series (not just
the zeta function), then the number fields are isomorphic.This is also
equivalent to the purely algebraic statement that there exists a topological
group isomorphism as a above and a norm-preserving group isomorphism between
the ideals of the fields that is compatible with the Artin maps via the other
map.
