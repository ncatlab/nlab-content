Corbin is a musician. After reading far too much about computer science, Corbin is writing articles for the community. This page is a third-person collection of notes, because Corbin is scatterbrained and loses track of work easily.

## Things to do

### Stubs

The following pages need to be created and stubbed:

* [[Shutt expressiveness]] and [[Shutt abstraction]], based on [Shutt's writings about abstractive power](https://fexpr.blogspot.com/2013/12/abstractive-power.html)
* [[meros]], a relational version of topoi
* [[categorical combinator]], explaining Curien and Hagino
* [[Hagino CPL]], Hagino's Categorical Programming Language
* [[complexity class]]
* [[Impagliazzo's five worlds]], the hidden gem of complexity theory
* [[TurCat]], maybe? This is the category where each object is a [[Turing category]] and the arrows are functors which preserve restriction structure. It's a full subcategory of [[RCat]], where each object is a [[restriction category]].

### Additions

Big changes needed:

* [[Haskell]] really should be clarified when it comes to category theory. At least [Fast & Loose](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf) and [Hask](https://wiki.haskell.org/Hask) should be linked.
* [[Separation axiom]] and [[topological vector space]] could have zaha-style diagrams, see [this conversation](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13419/catabase-a-database-of-categories/) for details.

### Original research

Pages that I need to write from scratch based on my own research:

* [[Tomb]], my precious child, the e.w. subcategory of TurCat whose arrows are compilers. Can't write this page until I know what a compiler is.
* [[Metaverse theory]], my pipe dream where literary analysis is categorified
* [[Perfectoid dramatic analysis]], the number-theoretic version of metaverse theory
* [[Compositional tool-assisted speedrunning]], a categorified approach to TAS
* [[Cammy]], my own take on Curien and Hagino, might not be a fit for nLab since it's already got [an esowiki page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cammy).
