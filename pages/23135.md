## Pages to work on

* [[categorical combinator]], explaining Curien and Hagino
* [[Cheng morality]], maybe? The [original paper](http://eugeniacheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cheng-morality.pdf) is important, but not sure of the name. Contrast with e.g. [[Pirsig morality]], which definitely is not as relevant.
* [[complexity class]]
* [[complexity theory]]
* [[Haskell]] really should be clarified when it comes to category theory. At least [Fast & Loose](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf) and [Hask](https://wiki.haskell.org/Hask) should be linked.
* [[Impagliazzo's five worlds]], the hidden gem of complexity theory
* [[meros]]
* [[Shutt expressiveness]] and [[Shutt abstraction]], based on [Shutt's writings about abstractive power](https://fexpr.blogspot.com/2013/12/abstractive-power.html)
* [[separation axiom|Separation axiom]] and [[topological vector space]] could have zaha-style diagrams, see [this conversation](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13419/catabase-a-database-of-categories/) for details.
* [[timed set]], from the paper "Timed Sets, Functional Complexity, and Computability"
* [[TurCat]], maybe? This is the category where each object is a [[Turing category]] and the arrows are functors which preserve restriction structure. It's a full subcategory of [[RCat]], where each object is a [[restriction category]].
