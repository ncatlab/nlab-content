A [[filter]] $F$ a left $R$-[[module]] $M$ is _$F$-torsion_ if for any $m\in M$ there exists a $L$ in $F$ which annihilates it: $L m=0$. Given two filters $F,G$ in the [[lattice]] $I_l R$ of left ideals on $R$, one defines their __Gabriel composition__ (or __Gabriel product__) $F\bullet G$ as the set of all left $R$-[[ideal]]s $L$ such that there is $K$ in $G$ such that $K/L$ is $F$-torsion. Gabriel composition of filters corresponds to the [[Gabriel multiplication]] of the corresponding torsion classes considered as strictly full subcategories. A Gabriel composition of [[uniform filter]]s is uniform.
