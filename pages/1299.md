Given a filter $F$ a left $R$-module $M$ is $F$-torsion if for any $m\in M$ there exists a $L$ in $F$ which annihilates it: $Lm=0$. Given two filters $F,G$ in the lattice $I_l R$ of left ideals in $R$, one defines their __Gabriel composition__ (or Gabriel product) $F\bullet G$ as the set o all left $R$-ideals $L$ such that there is $K$ in $G$ such that $K/L$ is $F$-torsion. Gabriel composition of filters corresponds to the [[Gabriel multiplication]] of the corresponding torsion classes considered as strictly full subcategories. Gabriel composition of [[uniform filter]]s is uniform.
