
One definition of the _generalized Fitting subgroup_  $F^*(G)$ of a [[group]] $G$ is that it is the [[subgroup]] generated by all [[normal subgroup]]s $N$ of $G$ possessing subgroups $N_1,N_2,\dots, N_r$ for some integer $r$ such that $N=N_1N_2\cdots N_r$; $x_i x_j=x_j x_i$ for all $x_i\in N_i$, $x_j\in N_j$, and distinct subscripts $i$ and $j$; and each $N_i$ either has prime power order or is a [[quasisimple group]]. [[Helmut Bender]] proved that $F^*(G)$ itself enjoys these properties. 

Named after [[Hans Fitting]].
