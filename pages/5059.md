## Idea

The _Green-Schwarz action functional_ is the [[action functional]] of a [[sigma-model]] that describes the propagation of a fundamental $p$-[[brane]] $\Sigma$ on a [[supermanifold]] [[spacetime]].

For $p = 0$ this is the **Green-Schwarz superparticle.

For $p = 1$ the **Green-Schwarz superstring** (at the center of attention in [[string theory]]).

## Properties

The Green-Schwarz action functional of a $p$-brane propagating on an $d$-dimensional target spacetimes makes sense only for special combinations of $(p,d)$.



The corresponding table has been called the **brane scan**
