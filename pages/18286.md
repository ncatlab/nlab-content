## Statement


Every [[separable space|separable]] [[metrisable topological space]] is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]].

With the [[axiom of choice]] we have more generally that:


Every [[metrisable topological space]] is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]. 

The historica **proof** proceeds in the two steps

1. [[metric spaces are fully normal]]

1. [[fully normal spaces are equivalently paracompact]].
