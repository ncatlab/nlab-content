## Idea

What is called the _Feynman propagator_ (or just _propagator_ for short) in [[quantum field theory]] of [[scalar particles]] or other [[bosons]] is effectively the [[Green's function]] of the [[wave operator]] of the given [[field (physics)]]/[[particle]] (e.g. [GFP](#GFP)).

For [[fermion]] fields the analogous expressions are called _Dirac propagators_.

From another perspective, the loop contributions of [[Feynman diagrams]] are typically would-be [[traces]] over inverse powers $H^{-n}$ of the relativistic particle [[Hamiltonian]].

For instance for the free [[scalar particle]] of [[mass]] $m$ in 4d [[Minkowski spacetime]] the 1-loop term is 

$$
  \propto \int d^4 \mathbf{p} \; \frac{1}{\mathbf{p}^2+ m^2}
$$

where the integral would naively be over all of $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is of course not well defined. The integrand here is typically called the _Feynman  propagator_ or _propagator_ for short (e.g. [Kleinert 11, 8.1](#Kleinert11)). 

Several methods are considered for _[[regularization (physics)|regularizing]]_, hence making sense of it as a finite expression. One of these is [[zeta function regularization]] (e.g. [Kleinert 11, 8.1 (c)](#Kleinert11)). Here one notices that the [[zeta function of an elliptic differential operator|zeta function]] of the [[wave operator]]/[[Laplace operator]] $H = \mathbf{p}^2 + m^2$ is well-defined for $\Re(s) \gt 1$ by the naive [[trace]]

$$
  \zeta_H(s)\coloneqq Tr( H^{-s} )
$$

and defined from there by [[analytic continuation]] on allmost all of the [[complex plane]]. The [[special values of L-functions|special value]] at $s = 1$ (or its [[residue]]) is the regularized Feynman propagator.
