## Idea

What is called the _Feynman propagator_ (or just _propagator_ for short) in [[quantum field theory]] of [[scalar particles]] or other [[bosons]] is effectively the [[Green's function]] of the [[wave operator]] of the given [[field (physics)]]/[[particle]] (e.g. [GFP](#GFP)).

For [[fermion]] fields the analogous expressions are called _Dirac propagators_.

From another perspective, the loop contributions of [[Feynman diagrams]] are typically would-be [[traces]] over inverse powers $H^{-n}$ of the relativistic particle [[Hamiltonian]].

For instance for the free [[scalar particle]] of [[mass]] $m$ in 4d [[Minkowski spacetime]] the 1-loop [[vacuum amplitude]] is the regularized trace over the Feynman propagator

$$
  \propto \int d^4 \mathbf{p} \; \frac{1}{\mathbf{p}^2 - m^2}
$$

where the integral would naively be over all of $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is of course not well defined. The integrand here is typically called the _Feynman  propagator_ or _propagator_ for short (e.g. [Grozin 05, section 2.1](#Grozin05) [Kleinert 11, 8.1](#Kleinert11)). See at _[Feynman diagram -- For finitely many degrees of freedoms](Feynman+diagram#ForFinitelyManyDegreesOfFreedom)_ for how this comes about.

Several methods are considered for _[[regularization (physics)|regularizing]]_, hence making sense of it as a finite expression. One of these is [[zeta function regularization]] (also "analytic regularization/renormalization" [Speer 71](#Speer71)). Here one notices that the [[zeta function of an elliptic differential operator|zeta function]] of the [[wave operator]]/[[Laplace operator]] $H = \mathbf{p}^2 + m^2$ is well-defined for $\Re(s) \gt 1$ by the naive [[trace]]

$$
  \hat \zeta_H(s)\coloneqq Tr_{reg}( H^{-s} )
$$

and defined from there by [[analytic continuation]] on allmost all of the [[complex plane]]. The [[special values of L-functions|special value]] at $s = 1$ (or its [[principal value]]) is the regularized Feynman propagator. See ([BCEMZ 03, section 2.4.2](#BCEMZ03)).  For the example of the above basic Feynman propagator see e.g. [Grozin 05, section 2.1](#Grozin05)

Representing the (completed) [[zeta function]] here are the [[Mellin transform]] of some [[theta function]] -- which in the present case is the [[partition function]] $t\mapsto Tr_{reg} \exp(-t H)$ of the [[worldline formalism]] of the given theory, is what in the physics literature is known as the [[Schwinger parameter]]-formulation

$$
  Tr_{reg} H^{-s} = \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} Tr\, \exp(-t H)\,d t
  \,.
$$
