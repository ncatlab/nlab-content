## Idea

_Ricci flow_ is the [[gradient flow]] of the [[action functional]] of [[dilaton gravity]]: the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] coupled to a [[dilaton field]]. 

Equivalently it is the [[renormalization group flow]] of the [[bosonic string]] [[sigma-model]] for [[background gauge field|background fields]] containing [[gravity]] and [[dilaton]] (reviewed e.g. in [Woolgra 07](#Woolgra07), [Carfora 10](#Carfora10), see also the introduction of [Tseytlin 06](#Tseytlin06)).

In ([Perelman 02](#Perelman02)) Ricci flow for dilaton gravity in 3d was shown to enjoy sufficient monotonicity properties such as to complete [[Richard Hamilton]]'s proof of the [[Poincar√© conjecture]].
Hamilton's strategy was to equip a compact simply connected 3d manifold with a [[Riemannian metric]], argue that its Ricci flow will, after many "pinchings" (points where the metric degenerates) produce a collection of 3-[[spheres]] and conclude that therefor the original manifold must have been a 3-sphere, too. The technical problem is to control the number of pinchings, which may occur rapidly. Adding also the [[dilaton field]] turns out not to change the qualitative nature of the flow but make it "monotone enough" to control the pinching.

In [Rubinstein-Sinclair](#RubinsteinSinclair) a typical such Ricci flow with pinchings is visualized as follows:
