## Idea

_Ricci flow_ is the [[gradient flow]] of the the [[action functional]] of [[dilaton gravity]]: the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] coupled to a [[dilaton field]]. 

(Equivalently: it isthe [[renormalization group flow]] of the [[string]] [[sigma-model]] for [[background gauge field|background fields]] containing [[gravity]] and [[dilaton]].)

## References

The identification of Ricci flow as a gradient flow of gravity+dilaton is due to 

* Perelman, ...

and was a key step in his completion of Hamilton's program for how to prove the [[Poincare conjecture]].

A quick survey is in the slides
