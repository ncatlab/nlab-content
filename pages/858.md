A cubical T-complex is a [[cubical set]] $K$ which is also a special kind of Kan complex, in that it has  a family $T_n \subseteq K_n$, $n \geq 1$,  of elements called [[thin]] with the properties, due first to Keith Dakin, for the simplicial case, see [[simplicial T-complex]],  in his  doctoral thesis:

* T1) Degenerate elements are thin. 

* T2) Every box in $K$ has a unique thin filler. 

* T2) If all faces bar possibly one of a thin element are thin, then so also is the remaining face. 

Cubical T-complexes are equivalent to crossed complexes, and also to cubical omega-groupoids with connections. 

A modification of axiom T2) to be more like an axiom for a [[quasi-category]] is suggested in  the paper by Steiner below.
