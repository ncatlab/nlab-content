## Definition

Every [[algebraic category]] (in just about any sense of the term) has a [[terminal object]] which is usually called the __trivial algebra__, often denoted $0$ or $1$.  Its [[underlying set]] is a [[singleton]], and every algebraic operation $1^n \to 1$ is the unique [[function]] to the singleton set.


## Examples

*  The [[singleton set]] is itself the trivial [[set]].
*  The [[trivial group]] is the trivial [[group]].
*  The [[trivial ring]] is the trivial [[ring]].
*  The $0$-dimensional vector space is the trivial [[vector space]].
*  The [[trivial Lie algebra]] is the trivial [[Lie algebra]].
*  The [[trivial category]] is the trivial [[strict category]].
