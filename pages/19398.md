## Idea

The possible [[actions]] of well-behaved [[topological groups]] (such as [[compact Lie groups]]) on [[topological space|topological]] or [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[n-spheres]] display various interesting patterns in their classification. 

This entry is meant to eventually list and discuss some of these. For the moment it mainly just collects some references.

## Spherical space forms

Let $G$ be a [[discrete group]] and $\rho$ an [[action]] of $G$ on the [[n-sphere]] by [[isometries]], which is [[free action|free]] and [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuous]].

The induced [[quotient spaces]] $S^n/G$ in this case are also called _[[spherical space forms]]_.

###### Proposition

Given an continuous [[action]] of the [[circle group]] on the [[topological space|topological]] [[4-sphere]], its [[fixed point]] space is of one of two types:

1. either it is the [[0-sphere]] $S^0 \hookrightarrow S^4$

1. or it has the [[rational homotopy theory|rational homotopy type]] of an even-dimensional sphere.
