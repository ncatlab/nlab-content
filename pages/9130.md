## Definition

Given a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$, the **Einstein tensor** is the [[tensor]] field on $X$ given by

$$
  G \coloneqq Ric - \tfrac{1}{2}R g
  \,,
$$

where

* $Ric$ is the [[Ricci tensor]]

* $R$ is t
he [[scalar curvature]]

of the metric $g$.


## In gravity

The Einstein tensor is the [[variational derivative]] of the pure [[Einstein-Hilbert action]]. Therefore the [[equations of motion]] of [[gravity]] ([[Einstein's equations]]) are the [[equation]]

$$
  G = T
  \,,
$$

where $T$ is the [[energy-momentum tensor]] of the further [[force]]- and [[matter]]-[[field (physics)|fields]] of the [[theory (physics)|theory]].
