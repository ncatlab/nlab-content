## Definition

A [[homomorphism]] $f:X\to Y$ of [[schemes]] is a __closed immersion__ if it induces a [[homeomorphism]] of the underlying [[topological spaces]] (in the [[Zariski topology]]) and the [[comorphism]] $f^\sharp:\mathcal{O}_Y\to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is an [[epimorphism]] of sheaves on $Y$.

More generally, let us consider some category of spaces, i.e. [[sheaves]] of sets on $C = Aff$ equipped with a [[subcanonical Grothendieck topology]]. Then a morphism $F\to G$ of spaces is said to be __closed immersion__ if it is [[representable morphism|representable]] by a [[strict monomorphism]].
