## Definition

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. For all $(-2) \leq n \leq \infty$ the [[class]] of [[n-truncated]] morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$ forms the right class in a [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category]]. The left class is that of [[n-connected]] morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$.

This appears as a remark in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, Example 5.2.8.16]]. A construction of the factorization in terms of a [[model category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] is in ([Rezk, prop. 8.5](#Rezk)).

###### Remark

For $n = -1$ this says that [[effective epimorphisms in an (∞,1)-category]] have the left lifting property against [[monomorphisms in an (∞,1)-category]]. Therefore one may say that the effective epimorphisms in an $(\infty,1)$-topos are the [[strong epimorphisms]].
