###### Proposition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. For all $(-2) \leq n \leq \infty$ the [[class]] of [[n-truncated]] morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$ forms the right class in a [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category]]. The left class is that of [[n-connected]] morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$.

This appears as a remark in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, Example 5.2.8.16]]. A construction of the factorization in terms of a [[model category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] is in ([Rezk, prop. 8.5](#Rezk)).

###### Remark

For $n = -1$ this says that [[effective epimorphisms in an (∞,1)-category]] have the left lifting property against [[monomorphisms in an (∞,1)-category]]. Therefore one may say that the effective epimorphisms in an $(\infty,1)$-topos are the [[strong epimorphisms]].

## Examples

### The case $n = -2$

A [[(-2)-truncated]] [[morphism]] is precisely an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]] (see there or [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, example 5.5.6.13]]).

Moreover, every morphism is [[(-2)-connected]]. 

Therefore for $n = -2$ the $n$-connected/$n$-truncated factorization system says (only) that equivalences have inverses, unqique up to coherent homotopy.

### The case $n = -1$

A [[(-1)-truncated]] morphism is precisely a [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|full and faithful morphism]].

A [[(-1)-connected]] morphism is one whose [[homotopy fiber]]s are [[inhabited]].

In [[∞Grpd]] a morphism between _[[0-truncated]]_ [[object]]s ([[set]]s) 

* is full and faithful precisely if it is an [[injection]];

* has non-empty fibers precisely if it is an [[epimorphism]].

Therefore between 0-truncated objects the (-1)-connected/(-1)-truncated factorization system is the [[epi/mono factorization system]] and hence [[image]] factorization.

Generally, the (-1)-connected/(-1)-truncated factorization is through the **[[homotopy image]]** (see there for more details).


### The case $n = 0$

Let $X,Y$ be two [[groupoid]]s ([[homotopy n-type|homotopy 1-types]]) in [[∞Grpd]]. 

A morphism $X \to Y$ is [[0-truncated]] precisely if it is a [[faithful functor]]. 

A morphism $X \to Y$ is [[0-connected]] precisely if it is a [[full functor]] and an [[essentially surjective functor]].

Therefore on 1-trypes the 0-connected/0-truncated factorization system is the [[(eso+full, faithful) factorization system]].
