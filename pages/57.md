## Idea

Lie integration assigns to a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ -- or more generally an [[L-∞-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] or [[∞-Lie algebroid]] -- a [[Lie group]] -- or more generally [[∞-Lie groupoid]] -- that is [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]] modeled by $\mathfrak{g}$.

If the [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s $\mathfrak{a}$ involved are incarnated dually in the form of their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s $CE(\mathfrak{a})$ then the bare [[∞-groupoid]] (that is: without the smooth structure) integrating them is effectively given by the [[Sullivan construction]] from [[rational homotopy theory]] which turns a [[dg-algebra]] into a [[simplicial set]] (and then into a [[topological space]] by [[geometric realization]]) applied here to the [[dg-algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{a})$.

This construction applied to an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] reproduces the _integration method by paths_ in standard [[Lie theory]] (maybe less widely known than other integration methods). See our first example [below](#LieAlgebrasToLieGroups).

## Definition

Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] (for instance a [[Lie algebra]], or a [[Lie algebroid]] or an [[L-∞-algebra]]). 

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\Delta^n$ for the $n$-[[simplex]] regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] (with boundary and corners).  

For $d \in \mathbb{N}$, a **$d$-path** in the $\infty$-Lie algebroid is a morphism of $\infty$-Lie algebroids

$$
  \Sigma : T \Delta^d_{Diff} \to \mathfrak{a}
$$ 

from the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T \Delta^d_{Diff}$ of the standard smooth $d$-simplex to $\mathfrak{a}$.


Dually this a morphism of [[dg-algebra]]

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{a}) : \Sigma^*
$$

from the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{a}$ to the [[de Rham complex]].



### Integration to a discrete $\infty$-groupoid {#IntToBareGrpd}

Here we discuss the [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]s underlying the 
[[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s to which an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] integrates.

For $\mathfrak{a}$ an $\infty$-Lie algebroid, the $d$-paths in $\mathfrak{a}$ naturally form a [[simplicial set]] 

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{a})_{bare}
  :=
  \left(
   \cdots    
   Hom(T \Delta^2, \mathfrak{a})
   \stackrel{\t}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   Hom(T \Delta^1, \mathfrak{a})
   \stackrel{\to}{\to}
   Hom(T \Delta^0, \mathfrak{g})
  \right)
$$

which is a [[Kan complex]] under mild technical fine-tuning of the definition of $d$-paths.

Since morphisms of [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s are dually equivalent to [[dg-algebra]] morphisms of their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]], the above is equivalent to

$$
   \exp(\mathfrak{a})_{bare}
   :=
   (
   \cdots 
   Hom(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^2))
   \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   Hom(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^1))
   \stackrel{\to}{\to}
   Hom(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^0))
   )
  \,.
$$

This is (up to fine-tuning of the nature of the differential forms on the simplices) the [[Sullivan construction]] of [[rational homotopy theory]] that tuns a dg-algvebra into a simplicial set, applied to the dg-algebra $CE(\mathfrak{a})$.


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark
**(spurious homotopy groups)**

For $\mathfrak{a}$ a [[infinity-Lie algebroid|Lie n-algebroid]] (an $n$-[[truncated]] $\infty$-Lie algebroid) this construction will not yield in general an $n$-[[truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]] $\exp(\mathfrak{a})$. 

To see this, consider the example (discussed in detail [below](#LieAlgebrasToLieGroups)) that $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{g}$ is an ordinary [[Lie algebra]]. Then $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_n$ is canonically identified with the set of smooth based maps $\Delta^n \to G$ into the simply connected [[Lie group]] that integrates $\mathfrak{g}$ in ordinary [[Lie theory]]. This means that the simplicial [[homotopy group]]s of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ are the topological homotopy groups of $G$, which in general (say for $G$ the [[orthogonal group]] or [[unitary group]]) will be non-trivial in arbitrarily higher degree, even though $\mathfrak{g}$ is just a Lie 1-algebra. This phenomenon is well familiar from [[rational homotopy theory]], where a classical theorem asserts that the rational homotopy groups of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ are generated from the generators in a [[minimal Sullivan model]] resolution of $\mathfrak{g}$. 

=--

For the purposes of $\infty$-Lie theory therefore instead one wants to [[truncated|truncate]] $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ to its $(n+1)$-[[coskeleton]]

$$
  \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1}\exp(\mathfrak{a})_{bare}  
  \,.
$$


This divides out [[k-morphism|n-morphisms]] by $(n+1)$-morphisms and forgets all higher higher nontrivial morphisms, hence all higher homotopy groups.


### Integration to a smooth $\infty$-groupoid {#SmoothIntegration}

We now discuss Lie integration of $\infty$-Lie algebroids to [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s, [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$ over the [[site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$.

For discussing smooth families of $d$-paths we need the following technical notion.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ regard the $k$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^k$ as a [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[manifold with corners]] in the standard way. We think of this embedded into the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^k$ in the standard way with maximal rotation symmetry about the center of the simplex, and equip $\Delta^k$ with the [[metric space]] structure induced this way.

A smooth [[differential form]] $\omega$ on $\Delta^k$ is said to have **sitting instants** along the boundary if, for every $(r \lt k)$-face $F$ of $\Delta^k$ there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_F$ of $F$ in $\Delta^k$ such that $\omega$ restricted to $U$ is constant in the directions perpendicular to the $r$-face on its value restricted to that face.

More generally, for any $U \in $ [[CartSp]] a smooth differential form $\omega$ on $U \times\Delta^k$ is said to have sitting instants if there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all points $u : * \to U$ the pullback along  $(u, \mathrm{Id}) : \Delta^k \to U \times \Delta^k$ is a form with sitting instants on $\epsilon$-[[open neighbourhood|neighbourhood]]s of faces.

Smooth forms with sitting instants clearly form a sub-dg-algebra of all smooth forms. We write $\Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)$ for this sub-dg-algebra.

We write $\Omega_{si,vert}^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)$ for the further sub-dg-algebra of [[vertical differential form]]s with respect to the projection $p : U \times \Delta^k \to U$, hence the [[coequalizer]]

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U)
  \stackrel{\stackrel{p^*}{\to}}{\underset{0}{\to}}
  \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)
  \to
  \Omega^\bullet_{si, vert}(U \times \Delta^k)  
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Note that the dimension of the normal direction to a face depends on the dimension of the face:  there is one perpendicular direction to a codimension-1 face, and $k$ perpendicular directions to a
vertex. 

=--


+-- {: .un_example}
###### Examples

* A smooth 0-form (a [[smooth function]]) has sitting instants on $\Delta^1$ if in a neighbourhood of the endpoints it is constant.

  A smooth function $f : U \times \Delta^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ is in $\Omega^0_{\mathrm{vert}}(U \times \Delta^1)$ if there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for each $u \in U$ the function $f(u,-) : \Delta^1  \simeq [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is constant on $[0,\epsilon) \coprod (1-\epsilon,1)$.

* A smooth 1-form has sitting instants on $\Delta^1$ if in a neighbourhood of the endpoints it vanishes.

* Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]], $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(X)$ be a smooth differential form. Let 

  $$
    \phi : \Delta^n \to X
  $$

  be a [[smooth function]] that has [[sitting instant]]s as a function: towards any $k$-face of $\Delta^n$ it eventually becomes perpendicularly constant.

  Then the pullback form $\phi^* \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n)$ is a form with sitting instants.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

The condition of sitting instants serves to make smooth differential forms not be affected by the boundaries and corners of $\Delta^n$. Notably for $\omega_j \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^{n-1})$ a collection of forms with sitting instants on the $(n-1)$-cells of a horn $\Lambda^n_i$ that coincide on adjacent boundaries, and for

$$
  p : \Delta^n \to \Lambda^{n-1}_i
$$

a standard piecewise smooth [[retract]]s, the pullbacks

$$
  p^* \omega_i 
$$

glue to a single smooth form (with sitting instants) on $\Delta^n$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Notice that $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n)$ having sitting instants does not imply that there is a neighbourhood of the boundary of $\Delta^n$ on which $\omega$ is entirely constant. It is important for the following constructions that in the vicinity of the boundary $\omega$ is allowed to vary parallel to the boundary, just not perpendicular to it.

=--

For the following definition recall the [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] over the [[site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$. 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $\mathfrak{a}$ an [[L-∞ algebra]] of [[finite type]] with [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ define the [[simplicial presheaf]] $\exp(\mathfrak{a}) : CartSp_{smooth}^{op} \to sSet$ by

$$  
  \exp(\mathfrak{a})
  : 
  (U,[n]) \mapsto 
  Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{a}), 
  \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^n)_{si,vert})
  \,,
$$

for all $U \in $ [[CartSp]] and $[n] \in \Delta$. 

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Compared to the integration to [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]s [above](#IntToBareGrpd) this definition knows about $U$-parametrized _smooth families_ of $n$-paths in $\mathfrak{g}$.

The underlying [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] is recovered as that of the $\mathbb{R}^0 = *$-parametrized family:

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{a}) : \mathbb{R}^0 \mapsto \exp(\mathfrak{a})_{disc}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The objects $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ are indeed [[Kan complex]]es over each $U \in $ [[CartSp]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that the standard [[continuous function|continuous]] [[horn]] [[retract]]s $f : \Delta^k \to \Lambda^k_i$ are smooth away from the preimages of the $(r \lt k)$-faces of $\Lambda[k]^i$.

For $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda[k]^i)$ a differential form with sitting instants on $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods, let therefore $K \subset \partial \Delta^k$ be the set of points of distance $\leq \epsilon$ from any subface. Then we have a smooth function 

$$
  f : \Delta^k \setminus K \to \Lambda^k_i \setminus K
  \,.
$$

The pullback $f^* \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k \setminus K)$ may be extended constantly back to a form with sitting instants on all of $\Delta^k$. 

The resulting assignment

$$
  (CE(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{A}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda^k_i))
  \mapsto
  (CE(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{A}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda^k_i) \stackrel{f^*}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Delta^n))
$$

provides fillers for all [[horn]]s over all $U \in $ [[CartSp]].

=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Write $\mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(a)$ for the simplicial presheaf obtained by postcomposing $\exp(\mathfrak{a}) : CartSp^{op} \to sSet$ with the $(n+1)$-[[coskeleton]] [[functor]] $\mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} : sSet \stackrel{tr_n}{\to} sSet_{\leq n+1} \stackrel{cosk_{n+1}}{\to} sSet$.

### Interating Lie algebras to Lie groups {#LieAlgebrasToLieGroups}

Let $\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty$ be an ordinary (finite dimensional) [[Lie algebra]]. Standard [[Lie theory]] (see [[Lie's three theorems]]) provides a [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]] $G$ integrating $\mathfrak{g}$.

With $G$ regarded as a [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth ∞-group]] write $\mathbf{B}G \in $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for its [[delooping]]. The standard presentation of this on $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]$ is by the [[simplicial presheaf]] 

$$
  \mathbf{B}G_c : U \mapsto N(C^\infty(U,G) \stackrel{\to}{\to} *)
  *
  \,.
$$


See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#LieGroups">Cohesive ∞-groups -- Lie groups</a> for details.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The operation of [[parallel transport]] $P \exp(\int -) : \Omega^1([0,1], \mathfrak{g}) \to G$ yields a weak equivalence (in $[CartSp^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$)

$$
  P \exp(\int - )
  :
  \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) 
  \simeq 
   \mathbf{cosk}_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \simeq \mathbf{B}G_c
  \,.
$$

=--


This follows from the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]] and the following observation.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[simply connected]] [[smooth manifold]] and $x_0 \in X$ a basepoint, there is a canonical [[bijection]]

$$
  \Omega^1_{flat}(X,\mathfrak{g}) \simeq C^\infty_*(X,G)
$$

between the set of [[Lie-algebra valued 1-form]]s on $X$ whose [[curvature]] 2-form vanishes, and the set of [[smooth function]]s $X\to G$ that take $x_0$ to the neutral element $e \in G$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bijection is given as follows. For $A \in \Omega^1_{flat}(X,\mathfrak{g})$ a flat 1-form, the corresponding function $f_A : X \to G$ sends $x \in X$ to the [[parallel transport]] along any path $x_0 \to x$ from the base point to $x$

$$
  f_A : x \mapsto tra_A(x_0 \to x)
  \,.
$$

Because of the assumption that the [[curvature]] 2-form of $A$ vanishes and the assumption that $X$ is [[simply connected]], this assignment is independent of the choice of path.

Conversely, for every such function $f : X \to G$ we recover $A$ as the pullback of the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] on $G$

$$
  A = f^* \theta
  \,.
$$

=--

From this we obtain

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the proposition

The $\infty$-groupoid $\mathbf{cosk}_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g})$ is equivalent to the [[groupoid]] with a single object (no non-trivial 1-form on the point) whose morphisms are equivalence classes of smooth based paths $\Delta^1 \to G$ (with sitting instants), where two of these are taken to be equivalent if there is a smooth [[homotopy]] $D^2 \to G$ (with sitting instant) between them.

Since $G$ is [[simply connected]], these equivalence classes are labeled by the endpoints of these paths, hence are canonically identified with $G$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

We do not need to fall back to classical [[Lie theory]] to obtain $G$ in the above argument. A detailed discussion of how to find $G$ with its group structure and smooth structure from $d$-paths in $\mathfrak{g}$ is in ([Crainic](#Crainic)).

### Integrating to line/circle Lie $n$-groups {#IntegrationToLineNGroup}


+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 1$ write $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ for the [[L-∞-algebra]] whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is given by a single generator in degree $n$ and vanishing differential. We may call this the **line Lie $n$-algebra**.

Write $\mathbf{B}^{n} \mathbb{R}$ for the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#CircleLienGroup">smooth line (n+1)-group</a>.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Observation

The [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] underlying $\exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})$ is given by the [[Kan complex]] that in degree $k$ has the set of closed differential $n$-forms (with sitting instants) on the $k$-[[simplex]]

$$
  \exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})_{disc}
  : 
  [k] \mapsto \Omega^n_{si,cl}(\Delta^k)
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The $\infty$-Lie integration of $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ is the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#CircleLienGroup">line Lie n-group</a> $\mathbf{B}^{n} \mathbb{R}$. 

Moreover, with $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_{chn} \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]$ the standard presentation given under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] by the chain complex of sheaves concentrated in degree $n$ on $C^\infty(-, \mathbb{R})$ the equivalence is induced by the [[fiber integration]] of differential $n$-forms over the $n$-[[simplex]]:

$$
  \int_{\Delta^\bullet} 
   : 
  \exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n} \mathbb{R}_{chn}
  \,.
$$


=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


First we observe that the map

$$
  \int_{\Delta^\bullet}
  :
  (\omega \in \Omega^n_{si,vert,cl}(U \times \Delta^k))
  \mapsto
  \int_{\Delta^k} \omega \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})
$$ 

is a morphism of 
[[simplicial presheaves]] $\exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}_{chn}$ on [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$. Since it goes between presheaves of abelian [[simplicial group]]s by the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] it is sufficient to check that we have a morphism of [[chain complex]]es of presheaves on the corresponding [[Moore complex|normalized chain complex]]es.

The only nontrivial degree to check is degree $n$. Let $\lambda \in \Omega_{si,vert,cl}^n(\Delta^{n+1})$. The differential of the [[Moore complex|normalized chains complex]] sends this to the signed sum of its restrictions to the $n$-faces of the $(n+1)$-simplex. Followed by the integral over $\Delta^n$ this is the piecewise integral of $\lambda$ over the boundary of the $n$-simplex. Since $\lambda$ has sitting instants, there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that there are no contributions to this integral in an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the $(n-1)$-faces. Accordingly the integral is equivalently that over the smooth surface inscribed into the $(n+1)$-simplex, as indicated in the following diagram

Since $\lambda$ is a closed form on the $n$-simplex, this surface integral vanishes, by the [[Stokes theorem]]. Hence $\int_{\Delta^\bullet}$ is indeed a chain map.

It remains to show that $\int_{\Delta^\bullet} : \exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}_{chn}$ is an [[isomorphism]] on all the [[simplicial homotopy]]s group over each $U \in CartSp$. This amounts to the statement that 

1. a smooth family of closed $n$-forms with sitting instants on the boundary of $\Delta^{n+1}$ may be extended to a smooth family of closed forms with sitting instants on $\Delta^{n+1}$ precisely if their smooth family of integrals over the boundary vanishes;

1. Any smooth family of closed $n \lt k$-forms with sitting instants on the boundary of $\Delta^{k+1}$ may be extended to a smooth family of closed $n$-forms with sitting instants on $\Delta^{k+1}$.

To demonstrate this, we want to work with forms on the $(k+1)$-[[ball]] instead of the $(k+1)$-[[simplex]]. To achieve this, choose again $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ and construct the [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] image of $S^k \times [1,1-\epsilon]$ inside the $(k+1)$-simplex as indicated in the above diagram: outside an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the corners the image is a rectangular $\epsilon$-thickening of the faces of the simplex. Inside the $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of the corners it bends smoothly. By the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]] the diffeomorphism from this $\epsilon$-thickening of the smoothed boundary of the simplex to $S^k \times [1-\epsilon,1]$ extends to a smooth function from the $(k+1)$-simplex to the $(k+1)$-ball. 

By choosing $\epsilon$ smaller than each of the sitting instants of the given $n$-form on $\partial \Delta^{k+1}$, we have that this $n$-form vanishes on the $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of the corners and is hence entirely determined by its restriction to the smoothed simplex, identified with the $(k+1)$-ball.

It is now sufficient to show: a smooth family of smooth $n$-forms $\omega \in \Omega^n_{vert,cl}(U \times S^k)$ extends to a smooth family of closed $n$-forms $\hat \omega \in \Omega^n_{vert,cl}(U \times B^{k+1})$ that is radially constant in a neighbourhood of the boundary for all $n \lt k$ and for $k = n$ precisely if its smooth family of integrals vanishes, $\int_{S^k} \omega = 0 \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$.

Notice that over the point this is a direct consequence of the [[de Rham theorem]]: an $n$-form $\omega$ on $S^k$ is exact precisely if $n \lt k$  or if $n = k$ and its integral vanishes. In that case there is an $(n-1)$-form $A$ with $\omega = d A$. Choosing any smoothing function $f : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ (smooth, surjective, non,decreasing and constant in a neighbourhood of the boundary) we obtain an $n$-form $f \wedge A$ on $(0,1] \times S^k$, vertically constant in a neighbourhood of the ends of the interval, equal to $A$ at the top and vanishing at the bottom. Pushed forward along the canonical $(0,1] \times S^k \to D^{k+1}$ this defines a form on the $(k+1)$-ball, that we denote by the same symbol $f \wedge A$. Then the form $\hat \omega := d (f \wedge A)$ solves the problem.

To complete the proof we have to show that this simple argument does extend to smooth families of forms, i.e., that we can choose the $(n-1)$-form $A$ in a way depending smoothly on the the $n$-form $\omega$. 

One way of achieving this is using [[Hodge theory]]. Fix a [[Riemannian metric]] on $S^n$, and let $\Delta$ be the corresponding [[Laplace operator]], and $\pi$ the projection on the space of [[harmonic forms]]. Then the 
<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hodge+theory#ResultsOverRiemannianManifold">central result of Hodge theory</a> for [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]]s states that the operator $\pi$, seen as an operator from the 
[[de Rham complex]] to itself, is a cochain map [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the identity, via an explicit homotopy $P := d^* G$ expressed in terms of the adjoint $d^*$ of the de Rham differential and of the [[Green operator]] $G$ of $\Delta$. Since the $k$-form $\omega$ is exact its projection on [[harmonic form]]s vanishes. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \omega & = (Id-\pi)\omega 
    \\
     & = d (P\omega)+P (d\omega)
    \\
    & = d (P\omega).
  \end{aligned}
$$

Hence $A := P\omega$ is a solution of the differential equation $d A=\omega$ depending smoothly on $\omega$.

### Integrating the string Lie 2-algebra to the string Lie 2-group

Let $\mathfrak{string} = \mathfrak{g}_\mu$ be the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

Then $\mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ is equivalent to the [[2-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}String$ 

* with a single object;

* whose morphisms are based paths in $G$;

* whose 2-morphisms are equivalence class of pairs $(\Sigma,c)$, where 

  * $\Sigma : D^2_*  \to D$ is a smooth based map (where we use a [[homeomorphism]] $D^2 \simeq \Delta^2$ which away from the corners is smooth, so that forms with sitting instants there do not see any non-smoothness, and the basepoint of $D^2_*$ is the 0-vertex of $\Delta^2$) 

  * and $c \in U(1)$, and where two such are equivalent if the maps coincides at their boundary and if for any 3-ball $\phi : D^3 \to G$ filling them the labels $c_1, c_2 \in U(1)$ differ by the integral $\int_{D^3} \phi^* \mu(\theta) \;\; mod \;\; \mathbb{Z}$,,

where $\theta$ is the [[Maurer-Cartan form]], $\mu(\theta) = \langle \theta\wedge [\theta \wedge \theta]\rangle $ the 3-form obtained by plugging it into the cocycle.

This is the [[string Lie 2-group]]. It's construction in terms of integration by paths is due to ([Henriques](#Henriques))
