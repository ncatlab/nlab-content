## Statement

The __representable functor theorem__ states that a [[Set]]-valued [[functor]] on a [[complete category]] is [[representable functor|representable]] if and only if it is [[continuous functor|continuous]] and has a [[solution set]].


## Related facts

As representable functors are ubiquitous, this theorem is essentially equivalent to the [[adjoint functor theorem]] and to theorems guaranteeing the existence of [[limits]].
