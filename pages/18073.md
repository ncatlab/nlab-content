###### Proposition

Assuming [[excluded middle]], then: 

Every [[Hausdorff topological space]] is a [[sober topological space]].

More specifically, in a Hausdorff topological space
the [[irreducible closed subspaces]] 
are precisely the [[singleton]] [[subspaces]].

###### Proof

The second statement clearly implies the first. To see the second
statement, suppose that $F$ is an irreducible closed subspace which
contained two distinct points $x \neq y$. Then by the Hausdorff property
there are disjoint neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y$, and hence it would follow that the relative [[complements]] $F \backslash U_x$ and $F \backslash U_y$ were distinct proper closed subsets of
$F$ with

$$
  F = (F \backslash U_x) \cup (F \backslash U_y)
$$

in contradiction to the assumption that $F$ is irreducible. 

This [[proof by contradiction|proves by contradiction]] that every irreducible closed subset is a singleton. 
Conversely, generally the [[topological closure]] of every singleton is irreducible closed.
