An **indiscrete category** is a [[category]] in which there is a unique [[morphism]] between any two [[object]]s.  This means that any [[inhabited set|inhabited]] indiscrete category is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[terminal category]].

The functor $Set\to Cat$ sending a set $X$ to the indiscrete category with $X$ as its set of objects is [[right adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $Cat\to Set$ sending a category to its set of objects.  The [[left adjoint]] to this forgetful functor sends a set $X$ to the [[discrete category]] on $X$.

Indiscrete categories are also called **chaotic** categories.
