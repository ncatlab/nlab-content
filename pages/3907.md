_Julius Wess_ was a theoretical physicist, one of the discoverers of the [[supersymmetry]] as a possible symmetry in physical models (with Bruno Zumino, and independently from Akulov and Volkov). With Zumino he introduced Wess-Zumino sigma model. From around 1990, he was working also on quantum groups and noncommutative geometry with a view toward physics on noncommutative space-times.
