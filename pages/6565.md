## Idea

What has come to be called _Geometric Algebra_ is a school of thought among some [[physics|physicists]] who amplify the good use of [[Clifford algebra]] in treatments of basic [[classical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

This is not about deep mathematical properties of Clifford algebras (for instance something like [[Bott periodicity]] or [[K-theory]] will never be mentioned in "Geometric Algebra"-texts), but is about clean and useful exposition of basic mechanics (classical and quantum). One point being made here is that the traditional textbook emphasis on the special geometry of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$ with its exceptional [[vector product]] structure is outdated and contra-productive and can be replaced by a more elegant and more universal description in terms of [[bivector]] calculus (which canonically embeds into the [[Clifford algebra]]).

Geometric Algebra is, naturally, strongest where it comes to the description of [[rotation]] and [[spin]]. 

At other points the strict emphasis of the Clifford algebra is maybe a bit too much.
