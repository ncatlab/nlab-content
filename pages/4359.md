###### Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, a [[closed subspace]] $F$ of $X$ is __irreducible__ if it is [[inhabited]] and not the [[union]] of two closed proper (i.e. smaller) subspaces. In other words, $F$ is irreducible if whenever $F_1$ and $F_2$ are closed subsets of $X$ such that 

$$
  F = F_1 \cup F_2
$$

then $F_1 = F$ or $F_2 = F$.

Equivalently this may be expressed in terms of [[open subsets]]:

###### Proposition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $P \in \tau \subset P(X)$ be a proper [[open subset]],
so that the [[complement]] $F \coloneqq X\backslash P$ is an [[inhabited]] [[closed subspace]]. Then $F$ 
is [[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]] in the sense of def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} precisely if whenever $U_1,U_2 \in \tau$ are open subsets
with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$:

$$
  X \backslash P \,\text{irreducible}
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{U_1, U_2 \in \tau}{\forall } 
    \left(
      \left(
        U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P
      \right) 
      \;\Rightarrow\;
      \left(U_1 \subset P \;\text{or}\; U_2 \subset P\right)
    \right)
  \right)
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Every [[closed subset]] $F_i \subset F$ may be exhibited as the [[complement]]

$$
  F_i = F \backslash U_i
$$

for some open subset $U_i \in \tau$. Observe that under this identification the condition
that $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_1 \cup F_2 = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equation labeled $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  F_1 \cup F_2
  & = 
  (F \backslash U_1) \cup (F \backslash U_2) 
  \\
  & 
  = \left( X \backslash (P \cup U_1) \right) \cup \left( X \backslash P \cup U_2 \right)
  \\
  & = X \backslash ( P \cup (U_1 \cap U_2)  )  
  \\
  & \stackrel{(\star)}{=}   X \backslash P 
  \\
  & = F  
\end{aligned}
\,.
$$

Similarly, the condition that $U_i \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_i = F$,
because it is quivalent to the equality $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equalities:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F_i &= F \backslash U_i
    \\
    & = X \backslash ( P \cup U_i )
    \\
    & \stackrel{(\star)}{=} X \backslash P
    \\
    & = 
    F
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Under these equivalences, the two conditions are manifestly the same.

## Properties

Note that the [[closure]] of any [[point]] of $X$ is an irreducible closed subspace.  $X$ is [[sober space|sober]] if and only if every irreducible closed subspace is the closure of a unique point of $X$.  In general, the irreducible closed subspaces of $X$ correspond to the [[point of a locale|points]] of the [[topological locale]] $\Omega(X)$, which are (by definition) the [[completely prime filters]] on the [[frame of open subspaces]] of $X$.  Specifically, given an irreducibly closed subspace, the filter of open subspaces that contain it is completely prime; conversely, given a completely prime filter of open subspaces, the closure of its intersection is irreducible.

The theory of irreducible closed subspaces is not useful in [[constructive mathematics]]; instead, one must use the [[completely prime filters]] directly.  While one might hope that the irreducibly open subsets (that is those that satisfy the conditions of Proposition \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}) might be more tractible constructively, they are in fact no better.  (We should probably put in the classical proof and see where it goes wrong.)
