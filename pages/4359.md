## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, a [[closed subspace]] $F$ of $X$ is __irreducible__ if it is [[inhabited]] and not the [[union]] of two closed proper (i.e. smaller) subspaces. In other words, $F$ is irreducible if whenever $F_1$ and $F_2$ are closed subsets of $X$ such that 

$$
  F = F_1 \cup F_2
$$

then $F_1 = F$ or $F_2 = F$.

## Properties

Note that the [[closure]] of any [[point]] of $X$ is an irreducible closed subspace.  $X$ is [[sober space|sober]] if and only if every irreducible closed subspace is the closure of a unique point of $X$.  In general, the irreducible closed subspaces of $X$ correspond to the [[point of a locale|points]] of the [[topological locale]] $\Omega(X)$.

The theory of irreducible closed subspaces is not useful in [[constructive mathematics]]; instead, one should use the [[completely prime filters]] on the [[frame of open subspaces]] of $X$ (which are the points of $\Omega(X)$ *by definition*).
