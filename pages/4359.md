Given a [[topological space]] $X$, a [[closed subspace]] $F$ of $X$ is __irreducible__ if there are exactly two ways to express $F$ as a [[union]] of two closed subspaces: $F = \empty \cup F$ and $F = F \cup \empty$.  In other words, $F$ must be [[inhabited set|inhabited]] (so that these two ways are distinct) but it must be impossible to express $F$ as a union of two inhabited closed subspaces.

Note that the closure of any [[point]] of $X$ is an irreducible closed subspace.  $X$ is [[sober space|sober]] if and only if every irreducible closed subspace is the closure of a unique point of $X$.  In general, the irreducible closed subspaces of $X$ correspond to the [[point of a locale|points]] of the [[topological locale]] $\Omega(X)$.

The theory of irreducible closed subspaces is not useful in [[constructive mathematics]]; instead, one should use the [[completely prime filters]] on the [[frame of open subspaces]] of $X$ (which are the points of $\Omega(X)$ *by definition*).
