## Idea ##
In the [[Haag-Kastler approach]] to [[quantum field theory]] the central object is a [[local net]] of [[operator algebras]]. The [[modular theory]] says that the local algebras have an associated modular group and a modular conjugation. The result of Bisognano-Wichmann that this page is about, describes the relation of these to the [[Poincare group]].

## The Theorem ##
Assume a Wightman field theory of a scalar neutral field is such that the smeared field operators generate the local algebras, see [[Wightman axioms]]. 

Then:

1. The modular group of the algebra associated with a wedge and the
vacuum vector coincides with the unitary representation of the group
of Lorentz boosts which maps the wedge onto itself.

2. The modular conjugation of the wedge W is given by the formula 
$$
J_W = \Theta U(R_W(\pi))
$$
Here $\Theta$ denotes the PCT-operator of the Wightman field theory and
$U(R_W(\pi))$ is the unitary representation of the rotation which leaves the
characteristic two-plane of the wedge invariant. The angle of rotation
is $\pi$.

3. The theory fulfills wedge duality, that is the commutant of the algebra associated to a wedge is the algebra associated to the causal complement of the wedge.
