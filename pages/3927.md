Any [[braided monoidal category]] has a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$B_{x,y} : x \otimes y \to y \otimes x $$

called the **braiding**.

A braided monoidal category is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] if and only if $B_{x,y}$ and $B_{y,x}$ are [[inverses]] (although they are isomorphisms regardless).

For example, in [[Vect]], the braiding maps $a \otimes b$ (a typical generator of $x \otimes y$) to $b \otimes a$. But a braiding is most interesting when it does *not* look like something trivial like that.
