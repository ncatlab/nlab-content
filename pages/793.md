## Idea

The space of [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] data consisting of

* a smooth [[manifold]] $X$

* equipped with the structure of a $k$-torus [[bundle]] $X \simeq Y \times T^k$;

* and equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]] $g$

* and a $U(1)$-[[gerbe]] with connection $G$

admits a certain operation that, roughly, inverts the Riemannian circumference of the torus fibers and mixes the metric with the gerbe data. This operation is called **T-duality**.

It was noticed originally in the study of [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] in the context of [[string theory]]: the conformal field theory [[sigma-model]]s with target space $X$ turn out to be equivalent as [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] for T-dual backgrounds $(X,g,G)$ and $(X',g',G')$ (at least to the approximate degree to which these are realized as full CFTs in the first place).

Further generalisations let $X$ be a nontrivial torus bundle, but the T-dual is then generically a bundle of [[noncommutative torus|non-commutative tori]]. (cite Mathai, Rosenberg and Hannabus)


## topological T-duality 

It turns out to be possible and useful to discuss just the _topological_ aspects of T-duality, meaning all the aspects that depend on the $X$ as a [[topological space]], on the topological class of the [[gerbe]] and of its 3-form curvature, but not on the [[Riemannian metric]] and not on the precise connection on the gerbe (there may be several inequivalent one for a given curvature)!

This sub-phenomenon is discussed in more detail at [[topological T-duality]].


## geometric T-duality

Another approach to the study of T-duality takes a somewhat complementary point of view and ignores the  [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|integral cohomology]] class in $H^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ of the [[gerbe]] but does consider the [[Riemannian metric]].

In this context T-duality is described as an isomorphism of [[standard Courant algebroid]]s. This picture emerged in the study of [[generalized complex geometry]].
