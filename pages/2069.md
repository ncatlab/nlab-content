[[!redirects fibration of simplicial sets]]
There are several different useful notions of morphisms between [[simplicial set]]s that are _fibrations_ in one sense or other.

Often the standard or the Joyal [[model structure on simplicial sets]] is understood in which case "fibration" is usually taken to mean [[Kan fibration]] or [[inner Kan fibration]].

But there are several other useful notions of fibrations. In as far as the simplicial sets in question are [[nerve]]s of [[category|categories]] or [[infinity-category|higher categories]] these notions of fibrations of simplicial sets translate in parts to various notions of fibrations of (higher) categories, such as [[Grothendieck fibration]]s.

The various notions, their meaning and the way they imply each other are this:

* [[Kan fibration]] 

  $\Rightarrow$ 

  [[right Kan fibration]]/[[left Kan fibration]] -- $(\infty,1)$-version of [[fibered category|category (co)fibered in groupoids]]

  $\Rightarrow$ 

  [[Cartesian fibration]]/[[Cartesian fibration|coCartesian fibration]] -- $(\infty,1)$-version of [[fibered category]]

  $\Rightarrow$ 

  [[categorical fibration]] 

  $\Rightarrow$ 

  [[inner Kan fibration]].

The study of left/right/inner Kan fibrations goes back to Joyal's work on the Joyal [[model structure on simplicial sets]] used in his work on [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].
