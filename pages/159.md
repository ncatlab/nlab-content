In [[higher category theory]] a notion of $\infty$-categories is said to describe **semi-strict** $\infty$-categories, if these are, somewhat vaguely, _as strict as possible while still being equivalent to general weak $\infty$-categories_.

For $n \leq 3$ two alternative semi-strictifications are known:

1. **Gray-semistrictness**: everything except the [[exchange law]]s hold strictly;

2. **Simpson-semistrictness**: everything except the unit laws hold strictly. See [[Simpson's conjecture]]
