## Overview

Various identities coming from [[algebraic geometry]] (and particularly [[algebraic groups]]) over  [[finite fields]] $\mathbb{F}_q$ turn out to make perfect sense _as expressions in $q$_ when extrapolated to the case $q=1$, and to reflect interesting (combinatorial, representation theoretical...) facts, even though, of course, there is no actual [[field]] with a single element (since in a field by definition the elements 1 and 0 are distinct).

Motivated by such observations, [[Jacques Tits]] envisioned a new kind of geometry adapted to the explanation of these identities. [[Christophe Soulé]] then expanded on Tits' ideas by introducing the notion of _field with one element_ and studying its fine arithmetic invariants. While there is no field with a single element in the standard sense of _[[field]]_, the idea is that there is some other object, denoted $\mathbb{F}_1$, such that it makes sense to speak of "geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$". Following the French pronunciation one also writes $F_{un}$ (and is thus led to the inevitable pun).

In the [[relative point of view]] the $S$-schemes are schemes with a morphism of schemes over a base scheme $S$; but every $S$-scheme is a scheme over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. In __absolute algebraic geometry__ all "generalized schemes" should live over $Spec(F_1)$ and $Spec(F_1)$ should live **below** $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$; this is similar to the fact that the quotient stacks like $[*/G]$ live below the single point $*$ (there is a direct image functor from sheaves on a point to sheaves over $[*/G]$. One of the principal and very bold hopes is that the study of $F_{un}$ should lead to a natural proof of [[Riemann conjecture]]; namely some attractive strategies to such a proof already exist (see MathOverflow [here](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/69389/riemann-hypothesis-via-absolute-geometry)).

## Contributors

After the very first observations by Tits, pioneers were Soulé and Kapranov and Smirnov. More recently there are extensive works by [[Alain Connes]] and Katia Consani, [[Nikolai Durov]], James Borger and Oliver Lorscheid.
