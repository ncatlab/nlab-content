# Overview

[[Jacques Tits]] first observed that many identities coming from algebraic geometry (and particularly algebraic groups) over finite [[fields]] $\mathbb{F}_q$ made perfect sense _as expression in $q$_ when extrapolated to the case $q=1$, and even reflected some interesting (combinatorial, representation theoretical...) facts, even though, of course, there is no actual field with a single element.

He defined a new kind of geometry adapted to the explanation of these identities. [[Christophe Soulé]] expanded on Tits' ideas by introducing the notion of field with one element and studying its fine arithmetic invariants. While there is no field $F_1$, there could be possibly some other object which would make sense of the algebraic geometry over the field of one element $F_1$, popular from the French pronunciation as $F_{un}$. In the [[relative point of view]] the $S$-schemes are schemes with a morphism of schemes over a base scheme $S$; but every $S$-scheme is a scheme over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. In __absolute algebraic geometry__ all "generalized schemes" should live over $Spec(F_1)$ and $Spec(F_1)$ should live **below** $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$; this is similar to the fact that the quotient stacks like $[*/G]$ live below the single point $*$ (there is a direct image functor from sheaves on a point to sheaves over $[*/G]$. One of the principal and very bold hopes is that the study of $F_{un}$ should lead to a natural proof of [[Riemann conjecture]]; namely some attractive strategies to such a proof already exist (see MathOverflow [here](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/69389/riemann-hypothesis-via-absolute-geometry)).

# Contributors

After the very first observations by Tits, pioneers were Soulé and Kapranov and Smirnov. More recently there is much work by [[Alain Connes]] and Katia Consani, by [[Nikolai Durov]], and James Borger.
