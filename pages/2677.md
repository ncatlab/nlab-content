# Idea

Christophe Soulé has observed that many identities coming from algebraic geometry over finite fields $F_q$ where $q$ is a prime number make sense if they are extrapolated to the case $q=1$. Of course there is no field $F_1$ but there is possibly some other object which would make sense of the algebraic geometry over the field of one element $F_1$, popular from the French pronunciation as $F_{un}$. In the [[relative point of view]] the $S$-schemes are schemes with a morphism of schemes over a base scheme $S$; but every $S$-scheme is a scheme over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. In absolute algebraic geometry all "generalized schemes" should live over $Spec(F_1)$ and $Spec(F_1)$ should live **below** $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$; this is similar to the fact that the quotient stacks like $[*/G]$ live below the single point $*$ (there is a direct image functor from sheaves on a point to sheaves over $[*/G]$. One of the principal and very bold hopes is that the study of $F_{un}$ should lead to a natural proof of [[Riemann conjecture]]; namely some attractive strategies to such a proof already exist.
