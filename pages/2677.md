## Overview

Various phenomena in the context of  [[algebraic geometry]]/[[arithmetic geometry]] (and particularly in the context of [[algebraic groups]]) over  [[finite fields]] $\mathbb{F}_q$ turn out to make perfect sense _as expressions in $q$_ when extrapolated to the case $q=1$, and to reflect interesting (combinatorial, representation theoretical...) facts, even though, of course, there is no actual [[field]] with a single element (since in a field by definition the elements 1 and 0 are distinct).

Motivated by such observations, [[Jacques Tits]] envisioned in ([Tits 57](#Tits57)) a new kind of geometry adapted to the explanation of these identities. [[Christophe Soulé]] then expanded on Tits' ideas by introducing the notion of _field with one element_ and studying its fine arithmetic invariants. While there is no field with a single element in the standard sense of _[[field]]_, the idea is that there is some other object, denoted $\mathbb{F}_1$, such that it does make sense to speak of "geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$". Following the French pronunciation one also writes $F_{un}$ (and is thus led to the inevitable pun).

In the [[relative point of view]] the $S$-schemes are schemes with a morphism of schemes over a base scheme $S$; but every $S$-scheme is a scheme over [[Spec(Z)]]. In __absolute algebraic geometry__ all "generalized schemes" should live over $Spec(F_1)$ and $Spec(F_1)$ should live **below** $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$; this is similar to the fact that the quotient stacks like $[*/G]$ live below the single point $*$ (there is a direct image functor from sheaves on a point to sheaves over $[*/G]$). One of the principal and very bold hopes is that the study of $F_{un}$ should lead to a natural proof of [[Riemann conjecture]] (see also MathOverflow [here](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/69389/riemann-hypothesis-via-absolute-geometry)). It was originally suggested by ([Manin 95](#Manin95)) that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] might be solved by finding an $\mathbb{F}_1$-[[analogy|analogue]] of [[André Weil]]'s proof for the case of [[arithmetic curves]] over the [[finite fields]] $\mathbb{F}_q$.

A first proposal for what a [[variety]] "over $\mathbb{F}_1$" ought to be is due to ([Soulé 04](#Soule)).  After that a plethora of further proposals appeared, including ([Connes-Consani 08](#ConnesConsani08)). 

## Borger's absolute geometry
 {#BorgerAbsoluteGeometry}

Maybe an emerging consensus is that the preferred approach is [[Borger's absolute geometry]] ([Borger 09](#Borger09)). Here the structure of a [[Lambda-ring]] on a ring $R$, hence on $Spec(R) \to Spec(\mathbb{Z})$,  is interpreted as a collection of lifts of all [[Frobenius morphisms]] and hence as [[descent]] data for descent to $Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)$ (which is defined thereby).  This definition yields an [[essential geometric morphism]] of [[gros topos|gros]] [[etale toposes]]

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
   \stackrel{\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}}
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
  \,,
$$

where on the right the notation is just suggestive, the [[topos]] is a suitable one over [[Lambda-rings]]. Here the middle [[inverse image]] is the [[forgetful functor]] which forgets the Lambda structure, and its [[right adjoint]] [[direct image]] is given by the [[arithmetic jet space]] construction (via the [[ring of Witt vectors]] construction).

This proposal seems to subsume many aspects of other existing proposals (see e.g. [Le Bruyn 13](#LeBruyn13)) and stands out as yielding an "absolute [[base topos]]" $Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))$ which is rich and genuinely interesting in its own right.
