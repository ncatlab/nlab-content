## Idea

A _symplectic $\infty$-groupoid_ is a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] equipped with a [[symplectic form]], or, more generally, with an [[n-plectic form]].

This is the generalization of the notion of [[symplectic manifold]] to [[higher symplectic geometry]]. It is also the image under [[Lie integration]] of the notion of [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid|symplectic L-∞ algebroid]], which is also a higher analog of symplectic manifolds, but in an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] way.

Notice that every symplectic manifold is in particular a [[Poisson manifold]] and that the structure of a Poisson manifold is equivalently encoded in the corresponding [[Poisson Lie algebroid]]. A _[[symplectic groupoid]]_ is the [[Lie integration]] of such a Poisson Lie algebroid. Therefore, strictly speaking, already "ordinary" symplectic geometry secretly involves [[Lie groupoid]]s. This insight is exploited in the refinement of [[geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids]]. 

## Properties

### As Lie integration of symplectic $L_\infty$-algebroids

Let $\mathfrak{P}$ be the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] corresponding to a [[Poisson manifold]] that comes from a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$.

Assume for the moment that $(X,\omega)$ has a global [[Darboux coordinate chart]] $\{x^i\}$. Write $\{\omega_{i j}\}$ for the components of the [[symplectic form]] in these coordinates, and $\{\omega^{i j}\}$ for the components of the [[inverse]].


Then the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{P})$ is generated from $\{x^i\}$ in degree 0 and $\{\partial_i\}$ in degree 1, with differential given by

$$
  d_{CE} x^i = - \omega^{i j} \partial_j
$$

$$
  d_{CE} \partial_i = \frac{\partial \pi^{j k}}{\partial i} \partial_j \wedge \partial_k = 0
  \,.
$$

The differential in the corresponding [[Weil algebra]] is hence

$$
  d_{W} x^i = - \omega^{i j} \partial_j + \mathbf{d}x^i
$$

$$
  d_{W} \partial_i = \mathbf{d} \partial_i
  \,.
$$


The symplectic [[invariant polynomial]] is

$$
  \mathbf{\omega} = \mathbf{d} x^i \wedge \mathbf{d} \partial_i \in W(\mathfrak{P})
  \,.
$$

Clearly we should introduce the new basis of generators with

$$
  \partial^i := -\omega^{i j} \partial_j
  \,.
$$

In this new basis we have a manifest isomorphism

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{P}) = CE(\mathfrak{T}X)
$$

with the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] of $X$. 

Therefore the [[Lie integration]] of $\mathfrak{P}$ is the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$, which, since we have assumed gloabl Darboux oordinates and [[contractible]] $X$, is just the [[pair groupoid]]:

$$
  \tau_1 \exp(\mathfrak{P}) = \Pi_1(X) = (X \times X \stackrel{\overset{p_2}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} X)
  \,.
$$

It remains to show that the symplectic form on $\mathfrak{P}$ makes this a [[symplectic groupoid]].

Notice that in the new basis the invariant polynomial reads

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{\omega} 
      &= 
     - \omega_{i j} \mathbf{d}x^i \wedge \mathbf{d} \partial^j 
     \\
      \mathbf{d}( \omega_{i j} \partial^i \wedge \mathbf{d}x^j)
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$



$$
  \mathbf{\omega}
   : 
  \mathfrak{T}\mathfrak{P} \to \mathfrak{T}b \mathbb{R}
$$

We construct the corresponding [[infinity-Chern-Weil theory|infinity-Chern-Weil homomorphism]].

$$
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{P})_{diff}
     &\stackrel{\exp(\mathbf{\omega})}{\to}&
    \exp(b \mathbb{R})_{dR}
    &\stackrel{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}{\to}&
    \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{R} 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{P})
  }
  \,.
$$

Over a test space $U$ in degree 1 an element in $\exp(\mathfrak{P})_{diff}$ is a pair
$(X^i, \eta^i)$

$$
  X^i \in C^\infty(U \times \Delta^1)
$$

$$
  \eta^i \in \Omega^1_{vert}(U \times \Delta^1)
  \,.
$$

This pair is taken by the top morphism to

$$
  (X^i, \eta^j) 
    \mapsto 
  \int_{\Delta^1}
    \omega_{i j} (d_{dR} X^i + \eta^i) \wedge d_{dR} \eta^j
  \in 
  \Omega^2(U)
  \,.
$$

By the [[Stokes theorem]] the integration yields

$$
  \cdots 
    =
  \omega_{i j} d_{dR} x^i \wedge \eta^j|_{1}
   -
  \omega_{i j} d_{dR} x^i \wedge \eta^j|_{0}
   + \cdots
  \,.
$$

Restricting this back to $\exp(\mathfrak{P})$ where the flatness conditions

$$
  d_{dR} X^i - \eta^i = 0
$$

and

$$
  d_{dR} \eta^i = 0
$$

holds this yields the promised form on the space of morphisms of the [[symplectic groupoid]].
