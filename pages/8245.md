A **pro-space** is a [[pro-object]] in a category of topological spaces. In many applications, the spaces considered will have the homotopy type of CW-complexes. This is the case in [[strong shape theory]], but also in the important applications to algebraic geometry.


Pro-simplicial sets are often called pro-spaces following the tradition in certain schools of homotopy theory of referring to simplicial sets as 'spaces'.


There are several useful model category structures on the category of pro-spaces.  These are described in Isaksen's paper (listed below).
