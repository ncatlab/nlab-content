## Idea

Sometimes  systems of 'spaces' are used  to approximate a space which does not have 'nice' properties.  This can be a general compact space (as in [[shape theory]], or an object of interest from algebraic geometry such as a scheme or algebraic stack. The use of [[Čech methods]], for instance, allows for the extraction of invariants (and other information) from an approximating pro-space using  methods from adapted standard homotopy theory, where standard method cannot be directly applied to the original 'spatial object'.

##Definition

A **pro-space** is a [[pro-object]] in a category of [[topological spaces]]. 


In many applications, the spaces considered will have the [[homotopy type]] of [[CW-complexes]]. This is the case in [[strong shape theory]], but also in the important applications to [[algebraic geometry]].


Pro-[[simplicial sets]] are often called pro-spaces following the tradition in certain schools of [[homotopy theory]] of referring to simplicial sets as 'spaces'.


There are several useful [[model category]] structures on categories of pro-spaces.  These are described in Isaksen's paper (listed below).
