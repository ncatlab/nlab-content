## Meanings

The word "locally" has several different meanings in category theory.

### Slice-wise

A [[category]] $C$ may be called "locally $P$" (for some property $P$) if each [[slice category]] $C/X$ is $P$. Examples include [[locally cartesian closed categories]].

### Hom-wise

A [[2-category]] $K$ (or more generally enriched category) may be called "locally $P$ (for some property $P$) if each [[hom-category]] (or more generally [[hom-object]]) $K[X, Y]$ is $P$. Examples include [[locally discrete 2-categories]], and locally graded and locally indexed categories.

### Local presentability

Categories are called [[locally presentable]] if they are [[accessible category|accessible]] and [[cocomplete]]. The "locally" in the name is intended to disambiguate between such categories and the [[finitely presentable objects]] in the 2-category [[Cat]].

## Ambiguity

Unfortunately, these meanings can overlap. For instance, the term "locally cartesian closed 2-category" could in theory refer either to a 2-category whose [[slice 2-categories]] are [[locally cartesian closed]], or a 2-category each of whose [[hom-categories]] are locally cartesian closed. For this reason, it is often worth considering whether a different term than "locally" may be used when naming such a concept.
