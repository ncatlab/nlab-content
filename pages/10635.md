## Idea

There are two parts of the fundamental theorem of [[differential calculus]]. The constructive content of the first part is that a [[uniformly continuous]] real-valued function on a closed bounded interval has an [[antiderivative]]. The second part is the [[Stokes theorem]] in the case of a closed bounded interval.

###### Theorem
A uniformly differentiable function $f:[0,1] \to {\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies $f(1) - f(0) = \int_0^1 \! f'(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$.  
=-- 

## Proofs

The following exposition is adapted from Bridger-Stolzenberg. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
**(Proof of theorem \ref{ExistAntiderivative})**. We are to show that $F' = f$ where $F$ is the function given by $F(x)= \int_{0}^x \! f(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are in $[0,1]$. Then $F(y)-F(x) = \int_{x}^y f(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. Hence $ (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) = \int_{x}^y \left( f(t) - f(x)\right) \, {\mathrm{d}}t  $. Thus the inequality
$$ 
| (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) | \le \int_{x}^y \! \left| f(t) - f(x)\right| \, {\mathrm{d}}t
$$

For $\epsilon$ a positive number, the uniformly continuity of $f$ gives a positive number $\delta$ such that $| y - x| \le \delta$ implies $|f(y) - f(x)|\le \epsilon$. For such $x$ and $y$, the above inequality implies that $ | (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) | \le \epsilon | y - x |$. Thus $F'(x) = f(x)$ and $F$ is uniformly differentiable.

The following lemma is known as the increasing function theorem. Here "increasing" is used in the weak sense, namely that $x \le y$ implies $f(x) \le f(y)$.

###### Lemma 
A function whose derivative is equal to zero is constant on each interval.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
It suffices to show that a function $f:[0,1] \to {\mathbb{R}}$ with $f' = 0$ is constant. Since $f' = 0$, both $f$ and $-f$ are uniformly differentiable. Hence we may apply the previous lemma to deduce that $f$ and $-f$ are increasing. Therefore $f$ is constant.

###### Proof 
**(Proof of theorem \ref{StokesForInterval})**. Define a function $g:[0,1]\to {\mathbb{R}}$ by $g(x) = \int_0^x \! f'(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. The uniform differentiability of $f$ implies that $f'$ is uniformly continuous. Hence we may apply the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to deduce that $g$ is uniformly differentiable with $g' = f'$. Since $g(0) = f(0)$, by the above lemma, we have $g = f$. In particular, $g(1) = f(1)$, which is the assertion of this theorem.

## In synthetic differential geometry

In synthetic differential geometry, the Stokes theorem in the case of $[0, 1]$ is mandated definitionally.

+--{: .num_defn}
###### Definition
For a map $f: [0, 1] \to R$, the __definite integral of its derivative__ $\int_0^1 \! f'(t) dt$ is equal to $f(1) - f(0)$.
=--

This defines the definite integral of each map which is the derivative of another map. The other part of the fundamental theorem of differential calculus is axiomatized into synthetic differential geometry.

 **Integration axiom**. A map $f: [0, 1]\to R$ has a unique antiderivative $g:[0,1]\to R$ that satisfies $g(0) = 0$.

Assuming the Integration axiom, the definite integral of every map is now defined.
