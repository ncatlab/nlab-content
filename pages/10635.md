## Idea

There are two parts of the fundamental theorem of [[differential calculus]]. The constructive content of the first part is that a [[uniformly continuous]] real-valued function on a closed bounded interval has an [[antiderivative]]. The second part is the [[Stokes theorem]] in the case of a closed bounded interval.

###### Theorem
A uniformly differentiable function $f:[0,1] \to {\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies $f(1) - f(0) = \int_0^1 \! f'(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$.

## Proofs

The following exposition is adapted from Bridger-Stolzenberg. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
**(Proof of theorem \ref{ExistAntiderivative})**. We are to show that $F' = f$ where $F$ is the function given by $F(x)= \int_{0}^x \! f(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are in $[0,1]$. Then $F(y)-F(x) = \int_{x}^y f(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. Hence $ (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) = \int_{x}^y \left( f(t) - f(x)\right) \, {\mathrm{d}}t  $. Thus the inequality
$$ 
| (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) | \le \int_{x}^y \! \left| f(t) - f(x)\right| \, {\mathrm{d}}t
$$

For $\epsilon$ a positive number, the uniformly continuity of $f$ gives a positive number $\delta$ such that $| y - x| \le \delta$ implies $|f(y) - f(x)|\le \epsilon$. For such $x$ and $y$, the above inequality implies that $ | (F(y)-F(x)) - f(x)(y-x) | \le \epsilon | y - x |$. Thus $F'(x) = f(x)$ and $F$ is uniformly differentiable.

The following lemma is known as the increasing function theorem. Here "increasing" is used in the weak sense, namely that $x \le y$ implies $f(x) \le f(y)$.

###### Proof 
It suffices to show that a function $f:[0,1] \to {\mathbb{R}}$ with $f' = 0$ is constant. Since $f' = 0$, both $f$ and $-f$ are uniformly differentiable. Hence we may apply the previous lemma to deduce that $f$ and $-f$ are increasing. Therefore $f$ is constant.

###### Proof 
**(Proof of theorem \ref{StokesForInterval})**. Define a function $g:[0,1]\to {\mathbb{R}}$ by $g(x) = \int_0^x \! f'(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$. The uniform differentiability of $f$ implies that $f'$ is uniformly continuous. Hence we may apply the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to deduce that $g$ is uniformly differentiable with $g' = f'$. Since $g(0) = f(0)$, by the above lemma, we have $g = f$. In particular, $g(1) = f(1)$, which is the assertion of this theorem.

## In synthetic differential geometry

The fundamental theorem of differential calculus is an axiom of synthetic differential geometry, namely the Integration Axiom.


+-- {: .num_theorem #ConvMathOfFTC} 
###### Theorem 
Suppose that the ring object $R$ has a preordering compatible with its ring structure. Denoting $D$ for the infinitesimal interval, further assume that for any $g: D \to R$, there exists a unique $b\in R$ such that each $d\in D$ satisfies $g(d) = g(0) + db$ (this is Axiom 1 in Kock). Then the following are equivalent.
1. **Integration axiom**. For $f: [0, 1]\to R$, there exists a unique $g:[0,1]\to R$ such that $g' = f$ and $g(0) = 0$.
1. **Increasing function theorem**. For $f: [0, 1] \to R$, if $f' \ge 0$, then $f$ is increasing.
1. **Law of bounded change**. For $f:[0,1] \to R$, if there exists $M_1$ and $M_2$ such that $M_1\le f' \le M_2$, then $M_1 \le f(1) - f(0) \le M_2$. 
=--

Suppose $f:[0,1] \to R$. The integration axiom gives a unique $g:[0,1] \to R$ such that $g' = f$ and $g(0) = 0$. We thus define the definite integral $\int_0^1 \! f(t) \, {\mathrm{d}}t$ as $g(1)$.
