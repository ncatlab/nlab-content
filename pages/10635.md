## Idea

There are two parts of the fundamental theorem of [[differential calculus]]. The constructive content of one part is that a [[uniformly continuous]] real-valued function on a closed bounded interval has an [[antiderivative]]. The other part is the [[Stokes theorem]] in the case of a closed bounded interval.

## In synthetic differential geometry

In [[synthetic differential geometry]], the Stokes theorem in the case of $[0, 1]$ is mandated definitionally.

###### Definition
For a map $f: [0, 1] \to R$, the __definite integral of its derivative__ $\int_0^1 \! f'(t) dt$ is equal to $f(1) - f(0)$.
=--

This defines the definite integral of each map which is the derivative of another map. The other part of the fundamental theorem of differential calculus is axiomatized into synthetic differential geometry. The Integration axiom below asserts that antiderivatives exist uniquely, up to a constant.

 **Integration axiom**. A map $f: [0, 1]\to R$ has a unique [[antiderivative]] $g:[0,1]\to R$ that satisfies $g(0) = 0$.

Assuming the Integration axiom, the definite integral of every map is now defined.
