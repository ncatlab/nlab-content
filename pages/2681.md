There is nobody who would be the one _in charge of the $n$Lab_ . 

But for all matters where an official decision-taking process is unavoidable we have a few regular contributors assembled voluntarily in a "steering committee".

The hope is that the steering committee will be **mainly superfluous**. But that it does serve as a decision-taking body in cases where without an official decision being taken the whole $n$Lab project would run into trouble.

If you feel you want to send a message to the closest of "those in charge of the $n$Lab", post a message to the [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/) under category General.


# Members #

Members of the $n$Lab steering committee currently include

This is the _primordial steering committe_ that is being formed in [this](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=86&page=1#Item_8) $n$Forum discussion.
