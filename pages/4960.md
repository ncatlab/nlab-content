## Idea {#Idea}

The definition of _cohesive topos_ or _category of cohesion_ aims to axiomatize properties of a [[topos]] that make it a [[gros topos]] of [[space]]s inside of which [[geometry]] may take place.

The idea behind the term is that a _geometric space_ is roughly something consisting of points or pieces that are _held together_ by some cohesion - for instance by [[topology]], by [[smooth structure]], etc.

The canonical [[global section]] geometric morphism $\Gamma : E \to Set$ of a cohesive topos over [[Set]] may be thought of as sending a space $X$ to its underlying set of points $\Gamma(X)$. Here $\Gamma(X)$ is $X$ with all _cohesion forgotten_ (for instance with the topology or the smooth structure forgotten)

Conversely, the [[left adjoint]] and [[right adjoint]] of $\Gamma$

$$
  E 
    \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{Codisc}{\leftarrow}}}
  Set
$$

send a set $S$ either to the [[discrete space]] $Disc(S)$ with _discrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[discrete topology]]) or to the [[codiscrete space]] $Codisc(S)$ with the _codiscrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[codiscrete topology]]) .

Moreover, the idea is that cohesion makes points lump together to _connected pieces_ . This is modeled by one more functor $\Pi_0 : E \to Set$ [[left adjoint]] to $Disc$. In the context of 1-[[topos theory]] this sends a cohesive space to its [[connected topos|connected components]] $(\Pi = \pi_0)$. More generally in an [[(n,1)-topos]]-theory context, $\Pi$ sends a cohesive space $X$ to the $(n-1)$-[[truncated|truncation]] of its [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|geometric fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$. See [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

In total this gives a quadruple of [[adjoint functor]]s

   $$
    (\Pi_0 \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : 
    E
     \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{Codisc}{\leftarrow}}}
    Set
    \;
   $$

A cohesive topos is a topos whose terminal [[geometric morphism]] admits an extenson to such a quadruple of adjoints, satisfying some further properties.

Notice that most objects in a cohesive topos are far from being just sets with extra structure: while the functor $\Gamma$ does produce the set of points underlying an object $X$ in the cohesive topos, it may happen that $X$ is very non-trivial but that nevertheless $\Gamma(X)$ has very few [[global element|points]] (possibly none, with the axioms so far). The [[subcategory]] of objects in $E$ that we may think of as point sets equipped with extra structure is the [[quasitopos]] $Conc_\Gamma(E)$ of the [[concrete sheaves]] inside $E$

$$
  Set 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Conc_\Gamma(E) 
    \stackrel{\overset{Conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  E
  \,.
$$

It is the fact that $E$ is a [[local topos]] that allows to identify $Conc_\Gamma(E)$.

To ensure that there is a minimum of points, one can add further axioms. From the above adjunctions one gets a canonical natural morphism

$$
  \Gamma X \to \Pi_0 X
$$

from the points of $X$ to the set of connected pieces of $X$. Demanding this to be an [[epimorphism]] is demanding that _each piece has at least one point_ .

Moreover, one can demand that the cohesive pieces of product or power spaces are the products of the cohesive pieces of the factors.  For powers of a single space, this is demanding that for all $S \in Set$ the following canonical map is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  \Pi_0(X^S) \xrightarrow{\simeq} (\Pi_0(X))^S
  \,.
$$

For more general products, it would be a similar map $\Pi_0(\prod_i X_i) \to \prod_i \Pi_0(X_i)$.  See the examples at [[cohesive site]] for concrete illustrations of these ideas.


## Definition


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A [[topos]] $E$ over some base topos $S$, i.e. equipped with a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) : E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}
  S
$$

is **cohesive** if it has the following [[stuff, structure, property|properties]]:

*  it is _local_ and _connected_ in the following sense:

   1. it is a [[locally connected topos]]: there exists a further [[left adjoint]] $(f_! \dashv f^*)$ satisfying a suitable condition;

   1. it is a [[connected topos]]: the functor $f_!$ preserves the [[terminal object]], or equivalently $f^*$ is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]];

   1. it is _strongly connected_ : $f_!$ preserves even all [[finite]] [[product]]s;

   1. it is a [[local topos]]: there exists a further [[right adjoint]] $(f_* \dashv f^!)$ (this is sufficient for $f$ to be local, since we have already assumed it to be connected);

   so that in total we have a quadruple of [[adjoint functor]]s
   
   $$
    (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
    E
     \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
    S
    \;
   $$

   Note that $f$ being local implies, in particular, that $S \stackrel{f^!}{\hookrightarrow} E$ is a [[subtopos]]: $f^!$ is a [[full and faithful functor]];


We say **cohesive pieces have points** in $E$ if the [[natural transformation]]

$$
  f_* X
  \stackrel{f_* (\iota)}{\to}
  f_* f^* f_! X
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  f_! X
$$

is an [[epimorphism]]. This is equivalent to the transformation

$$
  f^* \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} f^* f_* f^! \stackrel{\epsilon \cdot f^!}{\to} f^!
$$

being a [[monomorphism]].


We say **pieces of powers are powers of pieces** if for all $s \in S$ and $e \in E$ the natural morphism

$$
  f_! (e^{f^* s}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} (f_!(e))^s
$$

is an [[isomorphism]]

(this morphism is the [[internal hom]]-[[adjunct]] of 
$
  s \times f_!(e^{f^* s}) 
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  f_!f^*(s) \times f_!(e^{f^* s})
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  f_!(f^*(s) \times e^{f^* s})
  \to
  f_!(e)
$

where we use that by definition $f^*$ is full and faithful and then that $f_!$ preserves products).

## Properties {#Properties}

###### Theorem


Let $(\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) :  E \to S$ be a cohesive topos with $\Gamma X \to \Pi X$ an [[epimorphism]] for all $X$.

Let $s^* : L \hookrightarrow E$ be the [[full subcategory]] on those objects $X$ for which $\Gamma X \to \Pi X$ is an [[isomorphism]]. Then

1. $L$ is a [[reflective subcategory]] and a [[coreflective subcategory]]

   $$
     (s_! \dashv s^* \dashv s_*)
     : 
     E
       \stackrel{\overset{s_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{s^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{s_*}{\to}}}
     L 
   $$

1. $s_*$ preserves [[coproduct]]s.

1. the components of the reflector $X \to s_! s^* X$ are [[epimorphism]]s.

=--

This is [theorem 2](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/19/3/19-03.pdf#page=5) in ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $\Gamma$ is a [[left adjoint]] it preserves [[colimit]]s, as does of course $\Pi$. Therefore the collection of objects for which $\Gamma X \to \Pi X$ is an isomorphism is closed under colimits and hence $L$ has all colimits and the inclusion $s^* : L \hookrightarrow E$ obviously preserves them. Using the [[adjoint functor theorem]] this implies that $s^*$ has a right adjoint $s_*$. 

(...details...) 

Since $\Pi$ by assumption preserves finite products and $\Gamma$ preserves all products, it follows that $L$ is also closed under finite products and in particular contains the [[terminal object]] $*$. Since $E$, being a [[topos]], is an [[extensive category]], it follows that $s_*$ preserves coproducts.

(...details...)

Using that $\Gamma X \to \Pi X$ is an epi, we find that $L$ is also closed under [[subobject]]s: if $Y \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[monomorphism]] then if in

$$
  \array{
     \Gamma Y &\to& \Gamma X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     \Pi Y &\to& \Pi X
  }
$$

the right vertical morphism is an iso, then so is the left vertical one.

(...details...).

It then also follows that $L$ is closed under arbitrary products.

(...details...)

This implies the existence of $s_!$ and the fact that $X \to s^* s_! X$ is epi.

(...details...)

## Examples

A class of examples is obtained from toposes over a [[cohesive site]]:

Let $C$ be a [[cohesive site]]. The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$ is cohesive.

This includes...


### Simplicial sets {#SimplicialSets}

Let $C = \Delta$ be the [[simplex category]], regarded as a [[site]] with the trivial [[coverage]].

The corresponding [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(\Delta)$ is the [[presheaf topos]] $E = PSh(\Delta) = $ [[sSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s. 

We have for $X \in sSet$

* $\Gamma : X \mapsto X_0$;

* $\Pi_0 : X \mapsto \pi_0(X) = X_0/X_1$, the set of [[simplicial homotopy group|connected components]].

And for $S \in Set$:

* $Disc S$ the constant simplicial set on $S$;

* $Codisc S$ the simplicial set which in degree $k$ has the set of $(k+1)$-tuples of elements of $S$.


If $X, Y \in sSet$ are [[Kan complex]]es, then $\Pi_0(Y^X)$ is the set of [[simplicial homotopy]]-classes of maps $X \to Y$. We can therefore write the [[homotopy category]] of Kan complexes as

$$
  Ho_{KanCplx}(X,Y) = \Pi_0(Y^X)
  \,.
$$
