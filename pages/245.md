## Idea

Intuitively speaking, a braided monoidal category is a category with a tensor product and an isomorphism called the 'braiding' which lets us 'switch' two objects in a tensor product like $x \otimes y$.

## Definition

A **braided monoidal category** is a [[monoidal category]] $V$ equipped with a natural isomorphism
$$ B_{x,y} : x \otimes y \to y \otimes x $$
called the **braiding**, which must satisfy two axioms called **hexagon identities** encoding the compatibility of the braiding with the associator for the tensor product.  To see these identities, let us write $a_{x,y,z} : (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z)$ for the components of the associator in $V$.   Then the first hexagon identity says that for all $x,y,z \in Obj(V)$ the following diagram commutes:

$$
  \array{
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z 
   &\stackrel{a_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   x \otimes (y \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{B_{x,y \otimes z}}{\to}&
   (y \otimes z) \otimes x
   \\
   \downarrow^{B_{x,y}\otimes Id}
   &&&&
   \downarrow^{a_{y,z,x}}
   \\
   (y \otimes x) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{a_{y,x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (x \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{Id \otimes B_{x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (z \otimes x)
  }
$$

The second hexagon identity says that for all $x,y,z \in Obj(V)$ the following diagram commutes:

$$
  \array{
   x \otimes (y \otimes z) 
   &\stackrel{a^{-1}_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{B_{x \otimes y, z}}{\to}&
   z \otimes (x \otimes y)
   \\
   \downarrow^{Id \otimes B_{y,z}}
   &&&&
   \downarrow^{a^{-1}_{z,x,y}}
   \\
   x \otimes (z \otimes y)
   &\stackrel{a^{-1}_{x,z,y}}{\to}&
   (x \otimes z) \otimes y
   &\stackrel{B_{x,z} \otimes Id}{\to}&
   (z \otimes x) \otimes y
  }
$$

Intuitively speaking, the first hexagon identity says we can braid $x \otimes y$ past $z$ all at once or in two steps.  The second hexagon identity says we can braid $x$ past $y \otimes z$ 'all at once' or in two steps.

From these axioms, it follows that the braiding is compatible with the left and right unitors $l_x : I \otimes x \to x$ and $r_x : x \otimes I \to x$.   That is to say, for all objects $x$ the diagram

$$
  \array{
    I \otimes X &&\stackrel{B_{I,x}}{\to}&& x \otimes I
    \\
    & {}_{l_x}\searrow && \swarrow_{r_x}  
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

commutes.  

More tersely, we could define a braided monoidal category to be a [[tricategory]] with one object and one 1-cell.  However, unlike the definition of a monoidal category as a [[bicategory]] with one object, this identification is not trivial; a doubly-degenerate tricategory is literally a category with two monoidal structures that interchange up to isomorphism.  It requires the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] to deduce an equivalence with braided monoidal categories.

If the braiding squares to the identity, then the braided monoidal category is a [[symmetric monoidal category]].

## Basic Facts

There is a [[strict 2-category]] BrMonCat with:

* braided monoidal categories as objects,
* [[braided monoidal functor|braided monoidal functors]] as morphisms, 
* [[braided monoidal natural transformation|braided monoidal natural transformations]] as 2-morphisms.

A commutative [[monoid]] is the same as a monoid [[internalization|in the category of]] monoids.
Similarly, a braided monoidal category is equivalent to a monoidal-category object (that is, a [[pseudomonoid]]) in the monoidal 2-category of monoidal categories.  This result probably goes back to Joyal and Street.

Eventually we should include all these diagrams here, along with the definition of braided monoidal functor and braided monoidal natural transformation!  Can anyone help out?
