## Definition

Let $\phi\colon H\to G$ be a [[group homomorphism]], $V$ a [[representation]] of $H$, and $\chi$ the [[character]] of $V$.  The **induced character** $\phi_!(\chi)$ of $f$ is the character of the [[induced representation|induced]] $G$-representation
$$\phi_!(V) = Ind^G_H(V) = V\otimes_{k[H]} k[G].$$

## Formula

There is a formula for the induced character:

$$ \phi_!(\chi)(g) = \frac{1}{|H|} \sum_{k^{-1} g k = \phi(h)} \chi(h) $$

where the sum is over all pairs $(k\in G, h\in H)$ such that $k^{-1} g k = \phi(h)$.

This formula is usually given only in the case when $\phi$ is injective, when it can be re-expressed as a sum over [[cosets]].  The case when $\phi$ is surjective is [Exercise 7.1 of (Serre)](http://books.google.com/books?id=NCfZgr54TJ4C&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57) and the general case is easy to put together from these.  It can also be derived abstractly using [[bicategorical trace]].
