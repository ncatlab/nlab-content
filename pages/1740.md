In noncommutative case, [[determinant]]s are not a useful invariants of matrices (in fact, various classical formulas for determinants disagree over noncommutative [[ring]]s) and other polynomial suggestions were not much of success (in some cases the [[superdeterminant]] and Dieudonne's determinant are of use, but they can be easily expressed in terms of quasideterminants anyway). Quasideterminants will be noncommutative rational, rather than polynomial expressions. 

Let $A = (a^i_j)\in M_n(R)$ be a $n\times n$ matrix
over an arbitrary noncommutative unital associative ring $R$. In fact it makes sense to work with many objects (see [[horizontal categorification]]): having, say, an abelian category where $a^i_j$ is a morphism from the object $i$ to the object $j$. 
Let us choose a row label $i$ and a column label $j$.
By $A^{\hat{i}}_{\hat{j}}$ we'll denote the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix obtained
from $A$ by removing the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.
The $(i,j)$-th **quasideterminant** $|A|_{ij}$ is
\[ |A|_{ij} = a^i_j -
\sum_{k \neq i, l\neq j} a^i_l  (A^{\hat{i}}_{\hat{j}})^{-1}_{lk} a^k_j
\]
provided the right-hand side is defined (the corresponding inverses exist).

Up to $n^2$ quasideterminants of a given $A \in M_n(R)$
may be defined. If all the $n^2$ quasideterminants $|A|_{ij}$ exist
and are invertible then the inverse $A^{-1}$ of $A$ exist in
$A \in M_n(R)$ and

$$
(|A|_{ji})^{-1} = (A^{-1})^i_j.
$$

Quasideterminants for a matrix with entries in a commutative ring $R$ are up to a sign
ratios of the determinant of the matrix and the determinant
of the appropriate $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ submatrix, as one can see by remembering the formula for matrix inverse in terms of the cofactor matrices. For systems of linear equations with coefficients (from one side) in a noncommutative ring, there are solution formulas involving quasideterminants and generalizing Cramer's rule (hence left and right Cramer's rule). Quasideterminants with generic entries (entries in a free skewfield) satisfy generalizations of many classical identities: Muir's law of extensionality, Silvester's law etc. and a new "heredity" principle and so-called "homological identities". Furthermore, for polynomial equations over noncommutative rings, noncommutative Viete's formulas have been found and used in applications.

Quasideterminants were introduced by I. Gel'fand and V. Retakh around 1990.
