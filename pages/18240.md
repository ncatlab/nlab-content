###### Definition
**([[locally compact topological space]])**

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]_
if for every point $x \in X$ and every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$
there exists a smaller open neighbourhood $V_x \subset U_x$ whose [[topological closure]]
is [[compact topological space|compact]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}) and still contained in $U$:

$$
  \{x\} \subset V_x \subset \underset{\text{compact}}{Cl(V_x)} \subset U_x
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition
**(proper maps to locally compact spaces are closed)**

Let

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]],

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ a [[locally compact topological space]] according to def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace},

1. $f \colon X \to Y$ a [[continuous function]].

Then:

If $f$ is a [[proper map]], then it is a [[closed map]].

Proof:

Let $C \subset X$ be a closed subset. We need to show that every $y \in Y \backslash f(C)$ has an open neighbourhood $U_y \supset \{y\}$ not intersecting $f(C)$.

By local compactness, $y$ has an open neighbourhood $V_y$ whose topological closure $Cl(V_y)$ is compact. Hence since $f$ is proper, also $f^{-1}(Cl(V_y)) \subset X$ is compact. Then also 
$C \cap f^{-1}(Cl(V_y))$ is compact, and hence so is 

$$
  f(C \cap f^{-1}(Cl(V_y)))
  =
  f(C) \cap (Cl(V))
$$ 

This is also a [[closed subset]], since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]]. Now

$$
  U_y \coloneqq V_y \backslash f(C \cap f^{-1}(Cl(V_y)))
$$

is the required open neighbourhod.
