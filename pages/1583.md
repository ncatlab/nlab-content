## Definition

[[the|The]] **empty space** is the [[topological space]] with no points.  That is, it is the [[empty set]] equipped with its unique topology.


## Properties

The empty space is the [[initial object]] in [[Top]].  It satisfies all [[separation axiom|separation]], [[compact space|compactness]], and countability conditions ([[separable space|separability]], [[first-countable space|first countability]], [[second-countable space|second-countability]]).  It is also both [[discrete space|discrete]] and [[indiscrete space|indiscrete]], a distinction it shares only with the [[point]].


### Connectedness

Debate rages over whether the empty space is [[connected space|connected]] (and also [[path-connected space|path-connected]]).  With the common naive definitions that "a space is connected if it cannot be partitioned into disjoint nonempty open subsets" and "a space is path-connected if any two points in it can be joined by a path," the empty space is trivially both connected and path-connected.

However, in some ways these definitions are too naive.  The question of whether the empty set is (path-)connected is analogous in many ways to the question of whether $1$ is [[prime number|prime]].  The above definitions are then analogous to saying that "a natural number $p$ is prime if any factor of it is either equal to $1$ or to $p$," according to which $1$ is prime---but there are better definitions that exclude $1$.

For instance, we may say that "$p$ is prime if it has exactly two factors, itself and $1$;" with this definition $1$ is not prime, since it has exactly _one_ factor.   Likewise, we may say that a space is (path-)connected if it has exactly one (path-)[[component]]; with this definition the empty space is not connected, since it has exactly _zero_ components.  (Lest you question that last statement, note that the correct definition of a (path-)component of a space $X$ is as an [[equivalence class]] of points of $X$ under some [[equivalence relation]].  There is a unique equivalence relation on the empty set, and it has _zero_ equivalence classes.)

Here are some other reasons why the empty space should not be considered (path-)connected:

* If the empty space were (path-)connected, unique decomposition into (path-)connected components would fail: $X \cup Y = \emptyset \cup X \cup Y = \dots$.  This is analogous to how if $1$ were a prime, then unique factorization into primes would fail: $6 = 2 \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = \dots$.

* In [[homotopy theory]], one defines a space $X$ to be $k$-connected if $\pi_i(X)$ is trivial (that is, has exactly one element) for $i \le k$.  When $k =0$ this says that $\pi_0(X)$ should have exactly one component---that is, that $X$ should be path-connected.  (Actually, this definition really only makes sense if we phrase it in terms of homotopy [[groupoids]]; homotopy _groups_ are only defined once we choose a basepoint, which is clearly impossible for the empty space.)

* Category-theoretically, one may say that a space $X$ is connected if the [[functor]] $hom(X,-)$ preserves [[coproducts]].  Since $\hom(\emptyset,-)$ is constant at the point, it certainly does not preserve coproducts.
