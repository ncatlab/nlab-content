## Idea ##

Motivic cohomology was for a long time a hypothetical [[cohomology]] theory of [[scheme]]s whose hypothetical existence [[Alexander Grothendieck]] proposed in the 1960s should be the underlying reason for what are called the [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]].

In the mid 1990s [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed a concrete definition of motivic cohomology of a smooth [[scheme]] $X$ over a field as the hypercohomology of certain complex of sheaves on the Zariski or [[etale cohomology|etale]] [[site]] of $X$ (an analog of the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]]). This complex is called the **motivic complex**; existence of such complexes was predicted as part of so-called Beilinson dream. 

Voevodsky gave a concrete definition of the derived category of the hypothetical [[category of motives|category of mixed motives]]. Category of motives has both more objects, but also more morphisms than the category of schemes and it comes with a functor from an appropriate category of schemes.  Morphisms are certain [[correspondence]]s, and Voevodsky has shown that the motivic complexes are realized as derived hom-complexes in his derived category of mixed motives.

Voevodsky's proposal has been shown to have most properties that Grothendieck and Beilinson had demanded on the hypothetical cohomology theory, except that to date it hasn't been shown yet that the cohomology groups vanish in negative degree, as they should.

## Voevodsky's definition ##


The **motivic complex** -- a [[chain complex]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in abelian groups -- is defined in [definition 3.1, page 33](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=33) of

**Definition.** Motivic cohomology of a [[smooth scheme]] $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]], more specifically hypercohomology, of the motivic complex of sheaves with transfers on the Zariski site. See [definition 3,4, page 22](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=34).

The analogous definition with the Zariski [[site]] structure of $X$ replaced by the [[etale cohomology|etale site]] $Et(X)$ is in [lecture 10](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=87).

### As hom-sets of motives ###

Motivic cohomology computes certain derived hom-sets in the [[motive|category of motives]].

This is discussed in [lecture 14](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=121) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html). See [prop 14.16](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=126).
