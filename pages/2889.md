## Idea ##

The _motivic [[cohomology]]_ of a [[scheme]] $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the Zariski or [[etale cohomology|etale]] [[site]] of $X$ (an analog of the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]]) with coefficients in a complex of sheaves $A$ called the **motivic complex**.

## Definition ##

The **motivic complex** -- a [[chain complex]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in abelian groups -- is defined in [definition 3.1, page 33](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=33) of

The definition of motivic cohomology on a [[scheme]] $X$ as the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to the Zariski site structure on $X$ and with coefficients in the motivic complex is [definition 3,4, page 22](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=34).

The analogous definition with the Zariski [[site]] structure of $X$ replaced by the [[etale cohomology|etale site]] $Et(X)$ is in [lecture 10](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=87).

## Properties ##

Disucussion of the relation to the theory of [[motive]]s is in [lecture 14](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=121)
