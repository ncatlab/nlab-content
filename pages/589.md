## Definition

A [[category]] $C$ is **complete** if it has all small [[limit|limits]]: that is, if every diagram 

$$ F: D \to C$$

where $D$ is a [[small category]] has a limit in $C$.

Sometimes one says that $C$ is __small-complete__ to stress that $D$ must be small; compare [[finitely complete category]].  Also compare [[complete small category]], which is different; here we see that any [[small category]] that is also small-complete must be [[thin category|thin]] (at least classically).


## Examples

Many familiar categories of mathematical structures are complete: to name just a few examples, [[Set]], [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Vect]] and [[Top]] are complete.

As hinted above, every [[complete lattice]] is complete as a category.
