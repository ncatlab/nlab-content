## Idea

A _[[weak homotopy equivalence]]_ is a map between [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]] or similar which induces [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy groups]]. In [[homological algebra]] this is called a _[[quasi-isomorphism]]_.

The [[localization]] or [[simplicial localization]] of the categories [[Top]] and [[sSet]] at the weak homotopy equivalences used as [[weak equivalences]] yields the standard [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] and [[Ho(sSet)]] or the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoids]]/[[homotopy types]], respectively.

Weak homotopy equivalences are named after _[[homotopy equivalences]]_. They can be identified with homotopy equivalences after one allows to replace the [[domains]] by a [[resolution]]. The corresponding notions in [[homological algebra]] are [[quasi-isomorphisms]] and [[chain homotopy]]-equivalences.

From another perspective,  the notion of _weak homotopy equivalence_ is 'observational', in that a map is a weak homotopy equivalence if when we look at it through the observations that we can make of it using [[homotopy groups]] or even the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]], it looks like an equivalence.   In contrast, _[[homotopy equivalence]]_ is more ‘constructive’; in that $f$ is a homotopy equivalence if there exists an inverse for it (up to homotopy, of course).  Note that both of these notions are weaker than mere [[isomorphism]] of topological spaces (homeomorphism) and so can be considered examples of [[weak equivalence]]s.

There are actually two related concepts here: whether two spaces are weakly homotopy equivalent and whether a map between spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence.  The former is usually defined in terms of the latter.


## Definition (for topological spaces and simplicial sets)

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakHomotopyEquivalence}
###### Definition

For $X, Y \in $ [[Top]] or $\in $ [[sSet]] two [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]], a [[continuous function]] or [[simplicial set|simplicial map]] $f : X \to Y$ between them is called a **weak homotopy equivalence** if

1. $f$ induces an [[isomorphism]] of [[connected components]]

   $$
     \Pi_0(f) \colon \Pi_0(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Pi_0(Y)
   $$

   in [[Set]];

1. for all all [[points]] $x \in X$ and for all $(1 \leq n) \in \mathbb{N}$ $f$ induces an isomorphism on [[homotopy groups]]

   $$
     \pi_n(f,x) \colon \pi_n(X,x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \pi_n(Y,f(x))
   $$

   in [[Grp]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[connected space|path-connected]], then (1) is trivial, and it suffices to require (2) for a single (arbitrary) $x$, but in general one must require it for at least one $x$ in each path [[connected component]].

=--


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition


The [[homotopy category]] of [[Top]] with respect to weak homotopy equivalences is [[Ho(Top)]]${}_{whe}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Accordingly, weak homotopy equivalences are the [[weak equivalences]] in the standard [[Quillen model structure on topological spaces]] and the [[Quillen model structure on simplicial sets]], and also in the [[mixed model structure]].

## Properties

### Equivalent characterizations
 {#EquivalentCharacterizations}

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence 
precisely if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and for all [[commuting diagrams]] of continuous maps of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\to& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where the left morphism is the inclusion of the $(n-1)$-[[sphere]] as the [[boundary]] of the $n$-[[ball]], 
there exists a continuous map $\sigma : D^n \to X$
that makes the resulting upper triangle commute and such that the lower triangle commutes up to a [[homotopy]]

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &&\to&& X
    \\
    \\
    \downarrow && \nearrow & \swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\\\
    D^n &&\to&& Y
  }
$$

which is constant along $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$.

In this form the statement and its proof appears in 
([Jardine](#Jardine)) (where it is also generalized to weak equivalences in a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]). 
See also around ([Lurie, prop. 6.5.2.1](#Lurie)). The relevant arguments are spelled out in ([May, section 9.6](#May)). A variant is called the _HELP lemma_ in ([Vogt](#Vogt)).


### Relation to homotopy equivalences
 {#RelationToHomotopyEquivalences}

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[homotopy equivalence]] is a weak homotopy equivalence.  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It requires a little bit of thought to prove this, because $f$ and its homotopy inverse $g$ need not preserve any chosen basepoint.  But for any $x\in X$ and any $n\ge 1$, we have a diagram
$$\array{\pi_n(X,x) & & \to & & \pi_n(X,g(f(x)))\\
  & \searrow && \nearrow && \searrow\\
  && \pi_n(Y,f(x)) && \to && \pi_n(Y,f(g(f(x))))}$$
in which the two horizontal maps are isomorphisms because $g f$ and $f g$ are [[homotopy|homotopic]] to identities.  Hence, by the [[two-out-of-six property]] for isomorphisms, the diagonal maps are also all isomorphisms.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Conversely, any weak homotopy equivalence between [[m-cofibrant spaces]] (spaces that are homotopy equivalent to [[CW complexes]]) is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--

### Relation to homotopy types
 {#RelationToHomotopyTypes}

We discuss the [[equivalence relation]] generated by weak homotopy equivalence, called _(weak) [[homotopy type]]_. For the "abelianized" analog of this situation see at [[quasi-isomorphism]] the section _[Relation to homology type](quasi-isomorphism#RelationToChainHomologyType)_.

+-- {: .num_prop #ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}
###### Proposition

The existence of a weak homotopy equivalence from $X$ to $Y$ is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation]] on [[Top]], but it is not a  [[symmetric relation]].  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Reflexivity and transitivity are trivially checked. A counterexample to symmetry
is example \ref{CircleAndPseudoCircle} below.

=--

But we can consider the genuine equivalence relation _generated_ by weak homotopy equivalence:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

We say two spaces $X$ and $Y$ have the same **(weak) [[homotopy type]]** if they are equivalent under the [[equivalence relation]] _generated_ by weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Equivalently this means that $X$ and $Y$ have the same (weak) homotopy type
if there exists a [[zigzag]] of weak homotopy equivalences 

$$
  X \leftarrow \to\leftarrow \dots \to Y
  \,.
$$

This in turn is equivalent to saying that $X$ and $Y$ become [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] in the [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]]/[[Ho(sSet)]] with the weak homotopy equivalences [[localization|inverted]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Two spaces $X$ and $Y$ may have isomorphic homotopy groups without being weak homotopy equivalence: for this all the isomorphisms must be induced by an actual map $f : X \to Y$, as in the above definition.

However, if, roughly, one remembers,  how all the homotopy groups [[nLab:action|act]] on each other, then this is enough information to exhibit the full homotopy type. This collection of data is called the _[[Postnikov tower]]_ decomposition of a homotopy type.

=--



## For other kinds of spaces


A map of [[simplicial sets]] is called a weak homotopy equivalence equivalently if its [[geometric realization]] is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces, as above.  (Since the geometric realization of any simpicial set is a 
[[CW complex]], in this case its geometric realization is actually a [[homotopy equivalence]].)  

Likewise, a [[functor]] between [[small category|small]] categories is sometimes said to be a weak homotopy equivalence if its [[nerve]] is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets, hence of topological spaces after [[geometric realization of categories]].  These are the weak equivalences in the 
[[Thomason model structure]] on categories (not the [[canonical model structure]]). The statement of [[Quillen's theorem A]] and [[Quillen's theorem B]] in in this contex.

Similarly, one can define weak homotopy equivalences between any sort of object that has a [[geometric realization]], such as a [[cubical set]], a [[globular set]], an [[n-category]], an [[n-fold category]], and so on.

Note that in some of these cases, such as as simplicial sets, symmetric sets, and probably cubical sets, there is also a notion of "homotopy equivalence" from which this notion needs to be distinguished.  A simplicial homotopy equivalence, for instance, is a simplicial map $f:X\to Y$ with an inverse  $g:Y\to X$ and simplicial homotopies $X\times \Delta^1 \to X$ and $Y\times \Delta^1 \to Y$ relating $f g$ and $g f$ to identities.

A different direction of generalization is the notion of a [[homotopy equivalence of toposes]].

## Examples

### Of non-reversible weak homotopy equivalences
 {#ExamplesOfNonReversibleWHEs}

We discuss examples of weak homotopy equivalences that have no weak homotopy equivalence going the other way, according to prop. \ref{ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric} above.

+-- {: .num_example #CircleAndPseudoCircle}
###### Example

Let $S^1 \in $ [[Top]] denote the ordinary [[circle]] and $\mathbb{S}$ the 
[[pseudocircle]].

There is a [[continuous function]] $S^1 \to \mathbb{S}$ which is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence in particular $\pi_1(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$. But every continuous map the other way round has to induce the trivial map on $\pi_1$.

=--

This is the simplest in a class of counter-examples discussed in ([McCord](#McCord)).
