# Idea
{#idea}

A Frölicher space is one flavour of a [[generalized smooth space]]. 

Frölicher smooth spaces are determined by a rule for 

* how to map the real line smoothly into it, 

* and how to map out of the space smoothly to the real line.

In the general context of [[space and quantity]], Frölicher spaces take an intermediate symmetric position: they are both [[presheaf|presheaves]] as well as copresheaves on their test domain (which here is the full [[subcategory]] of manifolds on the real line) and both of these structures determine each other.

The general abstract idea behind this is described at [[Isbell envelope]].

+-- {: goal}
###### Goal
The intention for these pages is to develop the basic tools of differential topology for Frölicher spaces.
This means taking the basic pieces of "ordinary" differential topology and considering what they might look like for Frölicher spaces; including what looks the same and what looks different.

This project will both record existing structure and develop new ideas.
It is intentionally in the main area of the $n$-Lab to encourage contributions.

# Basics

+-- {: mynumdef #FroelicherSpace}
###### Definition
A _Frölicher Space_ is a triple $(X,C_X,F_X)$ where

1. $X$ is a set;
2. $C_X$ is a set of _curves_ in $X$; that is, $C_X \subseteq Set(\mathbb{R},X)$;
3. $F_X$ is a set of _functionals_ on $X$; that is, $F_X \subseteq Set(X, \mathbb{R})$;

subject to the following saturation conditions

1. if $c\in C_X$ and $f\in F_X$, then $f c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$,
1. if $c : \mathbb{R} \to X$ is a set map with the property that $f c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $f \in F_X$ then $c \in C_X$, and
2. if $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a set map with the property that $f c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $c \in C_X$ then $f \in F_X$.

A _morphism_ of Frölicher spaces, say $(X,C_X,F_X) \to (Y,C_Y,F_Y)$ is a set map $g : X \to Y$ satisfying the following (equivalent) conditions:

1. $g c \in C_Y$ for all $c \in C_X$,
2. $f g \in F_X$ for all $f \in F_Y$,
3. $f g c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $f \in F_Y$ and $c \in C_X$.

Frölicher spaces and their morphisms form a category with an obvious faithful functor to the category of sets.
The properties of this category are as follows.

+-- {: .num_theorem #FroelicherCategory}
###### Theorem
The [[category]] of Frölicher spaces is [[complete category|complete]], [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].  It is [[topological category|topological]] over $Set$.  It is an [[concrete category|amnestic, transportable construct]].
=--

To its eternal shame, the category of Frölicher spaces is __not__ [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]].
