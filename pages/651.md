+-- {: mynumdef #FroelicherSpace}
###### Definition
A _Frölicher Space_ is a triple $(X,C_X,F_X)$ where

1. $X$ is a set;
2. $C_X$ is a set of _curves_ in $X$; that is, $C_X \subseteq Set(\mathbb{R},X)$;
3. $F_X$ is a set of _functionals_ on $X$; that is, $F_X \subseteq Set(X, \mathbb{R})$;

subject to the following saturation conditions

1. if $c : \mathbb{R} \to X$ is a set map with the property that $f c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $f \in F_X$ then $c \in C_X$, and
2. if $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a set map with the property that $f c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $c \in C_X$ then $f \in F_X$.

A _morphism_ of Frölicher spaces, say $(X,C_X,F_X) \to (Y,C_Y,F_Y)$ is a set map $g : X \to Y$ satisfying the following (equivalent) conditions:

1. $g c \in C_Y$ for all $c \in C_X$,
2. $f g \in F_X$ for all $f \in F_Y$,
3. $f g c \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $f \in F_Y$ and $c \in C_X$.

Frölicher spaces and their morphisms form a category with an obvious faithful functor to the category of sets.
The properties of this category are as follows.

###### Theorem
The [[category]] of Frölicher spaces is [[complete category|complete]], [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].  It is [[topological category|topological]] over $Set$.  It is an [[construct|amnestic, transportable construct]].

# Isbell Envelope

Fr&ouml;licher spaces are examples of [[generalized smooth space|generalised smooth spaces]].  The category of F&ouml;licher spaces is also closely related to the concept of the [[Isbell envelope]] of a category.

+-- {: mynumdef #RCat}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{R}$ denote the category with one object and morphism set $C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$.
=--

There is a close relationship between Fr&ouml;licher spaces and the subcategory of $E(\mathcal{R})$, the Isbell envelope of $\mathcal{R}$, of those objects satisfying Isbell duality.

+-- {: .num_prop #IsbellIsFroelicher}
###### Proposition
An object of $E(\mathcal{R})$ that satisfies Isbell duality is a Fr&ouml;licher space.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
Let $X = (C,F)$ be a generalised $\mathcal{R}$-object satisfying Isbell duality.
From the page about the [[Isbell envelope]], $X$ is concrete.
Let $|X|$ denote the set of constant elements of $C$.
By concreteness, $C$ injects into $Set(\mathbb{R},|X|)$ and $F$ injects into $Set(|X|,\mathbb{R})$.
For clarity, we shall distinguish between an element of $C$ and its image in $Set(\mathbb{R},|X|)$ writing $\alpha$ for the former and $|\alpha|$ for the latter.
We shall do similarly for elements of $F$.

Suppose that $\beta : \mathbb{R} \to |X|$ is such that $|\phi| \circ \beta \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $\phi \in F$.
Then the map $\phi \mapsto |\phi|\circ \beta$ is a natural transformation $F \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ (it obvious commutes with the left $C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$-actions).
Hence it is an element of $C$.
That is, there is an element $\alpha$ of $C$ such that $\alpha(\phi) = |\phi| \circ \beta$ for all $\phi \in F$.

Let us compare $|\alpha|$ with $\beta$.
Let us put $\delta_t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as the constant function at $t$ then for all $\phi \in F$,
\[
\phi \circ (|\alpha|(t)) = \phi \circ \alpha \circ \delta_t = \alpha(\phi) \circ \delta_t = |\phi| \circ \beta \circ \delta_t = |\phi|(\beta(t)) = \phi \circ (\beta(t))
\]
But if $|\alpha|$ and $\beta$ differ, then they differ at some $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
Now for $x \ne y \in |X|$, as $X$ satisfies Isbell duality, there must be some $\phi \in F$ such that $\phi \circ x \ne \phi \circ y$.
Hence $|\alpha| = \beta$ and so $\beta$ is in the image of $C$ in $Set(\mathbb{R}, |X|)$.

For the other part, let $\theta : |X| \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that $\theta \circ |\alpha| \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ for all $\alpha \in C$.
Then, exactly as above, we define a natural transformation $C \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ by $\alpha \mapsto \theta \circ |\alpha|$.
This corresponds to some $\psi \in F$ and it remains to compare $|\psi|$ with $\theta$.
This is simpler since $x \in |X|$ is an element of $C$ and so $|\psi|(x) = \psi(x) = \theta \circ |x| = \theta(x)$.
=--

However, not all Fr&ouml;licher spaces can be obtained in this manner.
The simplest example is the following:
\[
(\{0,1\},\mathbb{R}^{\{0,1\}},\mathbb{R})
\]
where this is taken to mean that all curves are smooth and only the constant functionals are smooth.
The problem here is that there are far more curves than the functionals warrant.
Put another way, the functionals cannot distinguish between the points of the set.

All Fr&ouml;licher spaces satisfy half of the requirements for Isbell duality: the functions are always the natural transformations of the curves.

+-- {: .num_prop #FroFSat}
###### Proposition
The object of $E(\mathcal{R})$ corresponding to a Fr&ouml;licher space is $F$-saturated.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
Let $(X,C,F)$ be a Fr&ouml;licher space.
Recall from the page about the [[Isbell envelope]] that $F$-saturated means that $F$ is precisely the set of $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$-homs $C \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$.

We know that every element of $F$ gives a map $C \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ which commutes with the right actions.
As $C$ contains the constant functions at the points of $X$, this assignment is injective.

Let $\phi : C \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ commute with the right actions.
Define $|\phi| : X \to \mathbb{R}$ by $|\phi|(x) = \phi(\delta_x)$ where $\delta_x \in C$ is the constant function at $x$.
Then for $\alpha \in C$, $|\phi| \circ \alpha (t) = |\phi|(\alpha(t)) = |\phi|(\alpha \circ \delta_t) = \phi(\alpha \circ \delta_t) = \phi(\alpha) \circ \delta_t = \phi(\alpha)(t)$.
Hence $|\phi| \circ \alpha \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $\alpha \in C$ and so $|\phi|$ is in $F$.

Hence $(X,C,F)$ is $F$-saturated.
=--

The other half is more complicated.
Using concreteness one can see that the essence depends on comparing the set $X$ with the set of _constant_ natural transformations $F \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.
That is, those natural transformations $\gamma$ with the property that $\gamma(\phi)$ is a constant function in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $\phi \in F$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #NatTransFSet}
###### Lemma
A constant natural transformation $F \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ is a function $\alpha : F \to \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\alpha(\phi \circ \psi) = \phi(\alpha(\psi))$.
=--

Let us write $|F|$ for this set.

Now every point of $X$ defines a constant natural transformation via evaluation but the map $X \to |F|$ need be neither injective nor surjective.
However, we can determine conditions on when it is injective or surjective.
Injectivity is related to a fairly simple condition (as indicated by the example earlier).

+-- {: mynumdef #FroHausdorff}
###### Definition
A Fr&ouml;licher space is said to be _Hausdorff_ if the smooth functions separate points.
=--

+-- {: .num_prop #FroHausCSat}
###### Proposition
A Fr&ouml;licher space $(X,C,F)$ is Hausdorff if and only if the map $X \to |F|$ is injective.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
The key point here is that an element of $|F|$ is completely determined by its effect on functions in $F$.
Thus $x, y \in X$ are such that they define the same element of $|F|$ if and only if $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ for all $\phi \in F$.
This means that the smooth functions do not separate $x$ and $y$.
Hence $(X,C,F)$ is Hausdorff if and only if $X \to |F|$ is injective.
=--

It is simple to construct non-Hausdorff Fr&ouml;licher spaces.
Indeed, the example earlier was one.

Surjectivity is more complicated.
As currently stated, not even very simple Fr&ouml;licher spaces satisfy the surjectivity condition.

+-- {: .num_lemma #PlaneNonSurj}
###### Lemma
The Fr&ouml;licher space defined by the usual structure on $\mathbb{R}^2$ does not satisfy the surjectivity condition.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
We need to construct a map $\alpha : F \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathhbb{R})$ such that $\alpha(\psi \circ \phi) = \psi(\alpha(\phi))$ but which does not correspond to a point in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

A non-zero point $p \in \mathbb{R}^2$ defines an element $\pi_p$ of $F$ by composing orthogonal projection $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \langle p \rangle$ with the map $\langle p \rangle \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $p \mapsto 1$.
If $p, q \in \mathbb{R}^2$ are not collinear then the only situation in which $\psi \circ \pi_p = \phi \circ \pi_q$ is if $\psi$ and $\phi$ are constant functions.
To see this, let $p'$ be orthogonal to $p$ and $q'$ orthogonal to $q$ be such that the orthogonal projection of $p'$ to the line spanned by $q$ is $q$, and similarly $q'$ maps to $p$.
Then $p'$ and $q'$ span $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
\[
\begin{aligned}
\psi \circ \pi_p(\lambda p' + \mu q') &= \psi \circ \pi_p(\mu q') &&= \psi(\mu) \\
\phi \circ \pi_q(\lambda p' + \mu q') &= \phi \circ \pi_q(\lambda p') &&= \phi(\lambda)
\end{aligned}
\]
As this holds for all $\lambda, \mu$ we see that $\psi$ and $\phi$ are constant functions.

Moreover, the functions $\pi_p$ are "initial" in $F$ in the sense that if $\pi_p = \psi \circ \phi$ for some $\phi \in F$ then $\phi$ is of the form $\theta \circ \pi_p$.
We thus conclude that in defining a map $\alpha : F \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\alpha(\psi \circ \phi) = \psi(\alpha(\phi))$ we have free choice on the values $\alpha(\pi_p)$.
However, the maps $F \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ which come from evaluation do not have this free choice: their value on $\pi_p$ is completely determined by the values on $\pi_x$ and $\pi_y$.
=--

However, all is not lost.
The set of functions in a Fr&ouml;licher space has much more structure than simply composition by functions from $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #FroFunAlg}
###### Lemma
The set $F$ of functions in a Fr&ouml;licher space is a commutative $\mathbb{R}$-algebra.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
Let $(X,C,F)$ be a Fr&ouml;licher space.
Let $\phi, \psi, theta \in F$.
Then $\phi \circ \alpha$, $\psi \circ \alpha$, and $\theta \circ \alpha$ lie in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.
Thus as $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ is a ring,
\[
\phi \circ \alpha + (\theta \circ \alpha) \cdot (\psi \circ \alpha) = (\phi + \theta \cdot \psi) \circ \alpha
\]
is in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.
As this holds for all $\alpha \in C$, $\phi + \theta \cdot \psi \in F$.
It is commutative because $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ is commutative.
Finally we note that there is an obvious ring homomorphism $\mathbb{R} \to F$ sending $\lambda$ to the function $x \mapsto \lambda$.
=--

This suggests that we should consider a Fr&ouml;licher space not as a pair of functors $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{R}^{op} \to Set$ but as a pair of functors $\mathcal{R} \to Set$ and $\mathcal{R}^{op} \to Alg$.

There is yet more structure on $F$.
Not only can we compose element of $F$ with elements of $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ but if $\phi \in F$ is a particular element then we can compose $\phi$ with an element of $C^\infty(\im \phi, \mathbb{R})$.
This suggests that we ought to enlarge the category $\mathcal{R}$ so that its objects are the power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$.

(An alternative to this extension is to insist that the natural transformations be continuous with respect to a topology on $F$ compatible with the compact-open topology on $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.)

With these two augmentations, a constant natural transformation from $F(A) \to C^\infty(-,A)$, with $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, defines an algebra homomorphism $F(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\alpha(\psi) \in \im \psi$ for all $\psi \in F(\mathbb{R})$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #LemPairEval}
###### Lemma
Such a natural transformation, $\alpha$, has the property that for any pair $\phi, \psi \in F(\mathbb{R})$ there is a point $x \in X$ such that $\alpha(\psi) = \psi(x)$ and $\alpha(\phi) = \phi(x)$.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
Consider the function
\[
\theta = (\psi - \alpha(\psi))^2 + (\phi - \alpha(\phi))^2.
\]
As $\alpha$ is an algebra homomorphism, $\alpha(\theta) = 0$.
Since $\alpha(\theta) \in \im \theta$, there is thus some $x \in X$ such that $\theta(x) = 0$.
For this $x$ we therefore have that $\psi(x) = \alpha(\psi)$ and $\phi(x) = \alpha(\phi)$.
=--

This clearly extends to any finite family.
Indeed, from the proof of this result we deduce that the family
\[
\mathcal{A} := \big\{\{x : \phi(x) = \alpha(\phi)\} : \phi \in F(\mathbb{R})\big\}
\]
is directed and thus defines a filter on $X$.
If our natural transformation $\alpha$ is _not_ represented by a point on $X$ then this filter will have empty intersection.

Now consider the subfamily of $F(\mathbb{R})$ consisting of those functions $\phi$ with the property that $\im \phi \subseteq [0,1]$ and $\alpha(\phi) = 1$.
It is clear that if we restrict to this family then we still get all of $\mathcal{A}$.
We can order this family; there are two equivalent (but not isomorphic) orderings:

1. $\phi \leq \psi$ if $\phi(x) \leq \psi(x)$ for all $x \in X$, or
2. $\phi \leq \psi$ if $\phi^{-1}((0,1]) \subseteq \psi^{-1}((0,1])$.

This family is directed (downwards) since $\phi \psi \leq \phi$ (and $\psi$).
In any _reasonable_ topology on $F$ then this net converges to the zero function: on any compact subset of $X$ then we have $(\phi) \to 0$ uniformly.
Therefore if we simply add the condition that our natural transformation $\alpha$ be continuous (something we might have been ready to do anyway) we see that it must be represented by an element of $X$ since otherwise we have $\alpha(0) = \lim \alpha(\phi) = 1 \notin \im 0$.

Thus $X$ is the set of _continuous_ algebra homomorphisms $F \to \mathbb{R}$ and we finally see the relationship between Hausdorff Fr&ouml;licher spaces as objects in the Isbell envelope of $\mathbf{R}$ satisfying Isbell duality.

# Topological Notions of Fr&ouml;licher Spaces

In the above we used a couple of topological notions.
We used a vague notion of topology on the functions on a Fr&ouml;licher space and we introduced the notion of a Hausdorff Fr&ouml;licher space.
These illustrate two different ways of thinking of topological notions on Fr&ouml;licher spaces.
The one says that there is a functor (actually two functors) from the category of F&ouml;licher space to the category of topological spaces so we can say that a Fr&ouml;licher space has topological property $P$ if the corresponding topological space has it.
The other approach says that we can directly define a property for Fr&ouml;licher spaces that is _analogous_ to a topological property.
We then might hope for a theorem saying that a Fr&ouml;licher space with property $P$ defines a topological space with the corresponding property $P$.
However, this would definitely be a theorem.
This second approach is the one that I want to study in this section.

Let us start by defining the two functors to topological spaces.

+-- {: mynumdef #FroTop}
###### Definition
The _curvaceous_ topology on a Fr&ouml;licher space is the strongest topology for which the smooth curves are continuous.

The _functional_ topology on a Fr&ouml;licher space is the weakest topology for which the smooth functions are continuous.
=--

It is clear that these assignments are functorial, and that the curvaceous topology is always at least as strong as the functional topology.

In general, we shall often define two notions of each topological property: a curvaceous one and a functional one.
Sometimes these will be the same.

Let us start with some very simple definitions.

+-- {: mynumdef #DiscIndisc}
###### Definition
A Fr&ouml;licher space is said to be _indiscrete_ if all curves are smooth.

A Fr&ouml;licher space is said to be _discrete_ if all functions are smooth.
=--

Let us observe that there is no need for functional or curvaceous versions of these definitions.

+-- {: .num_lemma #LemDiscIndisc}
###### Lemma
A Fr&ouml;licher space is indiscrete if and only if the only smooth functions are the constant ones.

A Fr&ouml;licher space is discrete if and only if the only smooth curves are the constant ones.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
If all curves are smooth then for any points $x, y \in X$ the curve
\[
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
x & t \leq 0 \\
y & t \ge 0
\end{cases}
\]
is smooth.
Composition with $\phi \in F$ yields the function
\[
t \mapsto \begin{cases}
\phi(x) & t \leq 0 \\
\phi(y) & t \ge 0
\end{cases}
\]
For this to be a smooth function in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ we must have $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$, hence $\phi$ is constant.

For the converse, if the only smooth functions are constant then any curve $\alpha : \mathbb{R} \to X$ satisfies the condition that $\phi \circ \alpha \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ for all $\phi \in F$ so is in $C$.
Hence all curves are smooth.

The discrete case is similar.
=--

Earlier we introduced the notion of a _Hausdorff_ Fr&ouml;licher space.
Technically, we ought to have called that _functionally Hausdorff_ as it used the smooth functions in its definition.

+-- {: mynumdef #DefFroHausdorff}
###### Definition
A Fr&ouml;licher space is said to be _functionally Hausdorff_ if the smooth functions separate points.

A Fr&ouml;licher space is said to be _curvaceously Hausdorff_ if the only smooth curves with finite image are constant.
=--

However, the distinction is not important as the following lemma shows.

+-- {: .num_lemma #LemFroHausdorff}
###### Lemma
The notions of functional Hausdorff and curvaceously Hausdorff coincide and are equivalent to the underlying topological spaces being Hausdorff.
=--

+-- {: myproof}
###### Proof
Suppose that $(X,C,F)$ is not functionally Hausdorff.
Then there are $x \ne y \in X$ such that $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ for all $\phi \in X$.
Let $\alpha : \mathbb{R} \to X$ be the function taking the value $x$ for $t \leq 0$ and $y$ for $t \ge 0$.
Then $\phi \circ \alpha$ is constant for all $\phi \in F$ so $\alpha \in C$.
However, $\alpha$ has finite image but is not constant.
Thus $(X,C,F)$ is not curvaceously Hausdorff.

Conversely, suppose that $(X,C,F)$ is not curvaceously Hausdorff.
Then there is some $\alpha \in C$ with finite image which is not constant.
Let $\phi \in F$.
Then $\phi \circ \alpha$ has finite image in $\mathbb{R}$ and hence is constant.
Thus for $x, y \in \im \alpha$, $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ for all $\phi \in F$.
As $\alpha$ is not constant, there are thus $x \ne y \in X$ such that $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ for all $\phi \in F$ and so $(X,C,F)$ is not functionally Hausdorff.

If a Fr&ouml;licher space is Hausdorff then smooth functions separate points.
Thus for $x \ne y \in X$, there is a smooth function $\phi \in F$ with $\phi(x) = -1$ and $\phi(y) = 1$.
Then the sets $\phi^{-1}(-\infty,0)$ and $\phi^{-1}(0,\infty)$ are sufficient to show that $X$ with the functional topology is Hausdorff.
As the curvaceous topology is stronger than the functional one, it is thus also Hausdorff.

Suppose that $X$ with the curvaceous topology is Hausdorff.
Then any finite subset is discrete and so there are no non-constant continuous maps $\mathbb{R} \to X$ with finite image.
In particular, there are no non-constant smooth maps and so the original Fr&ouml;licher space was Hausdorff.
=--

In light of this, we shall refer to just _Hausdorff_ Fr&ouml;licher spaces.

Just as with topological spaces, there is a "Hausdorffification" functor.
Unlike topological spaces, this functor is split.

+-- {: .num_lemma #LemHausFunct}
###### Lemma
Let $(X,C,F)$ be a Fr&ouml;licher space.
Let $Y$ be the quotient of $X$ by the relation $x \sim y$ if $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ for all $\phi \in F$.
Then $Y$ inherits a Fr&ouml;licher space structure from $X$ with respect to which it is Hausdorff.
The natural map $X \to Y$ is a quotient mapping in the category of Fr&ouml;licher spaces.
It is split, but not canonically so.
