## Idea

In general two objects are considered _equivalent_ if they may be replaced by one another in all contexts under consideration, in particular whenever one is not doing anything [[evil]].

The general theory of equivalence is discussed at [[equivalence relation]], but the real question is the correct definition of equivalence in various situations.


## In higher category theory #

In [[higher category theory]] an **equivalence** often means a morphism which is invertible in a maximally weak sense (that is, up to all higher equivalences).  Two objects are **equivalent** if there is an equivalence between them.  For example:

* In a [[set]] (a $0$-[[0-category|category]]), equivalence is just [[equality]].

* In a [[category]] (a $1$-[[1-category|category]]), an equivalence is an [[isomorphism]].

* In a (possibly weak) $2$-[[2-category|category]], an equivalence is a morphism $f : x \to y$ such that there exists a morphism $g : y\to x$ and $2$-cell isomorphisms $f g \cong 1_y$ and $g f \cong 1_x$.  In the $2$-category [[Cat]] this reduces to the usual notion of [[equivalence of categories]] (although one must define $\Cat$ carefully using [[anafunctor]]s if one wants to avoid the [[axiom of choice]]).

* In a (possibly weak) $3$-[[3-category|category]], an equivalence is a morphism $f : x \to y$ such that there exists a morphism $g : y\to x$ and 2-cells $f g \to 1_y$ and $g f \to 1_x$ which are equivalences in the appropriate hom-2-categories.  In the (weak) 3-category $Bicat$ of [[bicategory|bicategories]], pseudofunctors, pseudonatural transformations, and modifications, such equivalences are often called _biequivalences_, and that term is sometimes also used for an equivalence in any $3$-category.

* In a (possibly weak) $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], an equivalence is a morphism $f : x \to y$ such that there exists a morphism $g : y\to x$ and 2-cells $f g \to 1_y$ and $g f \to 1_x$ which are equivalences in the appropriate hom-$\infty$-categories.  This can be made rigorous as a [[corecursion|corecursive definition]].

In addition to this, there is the notion of [[equivalence of categories]] (and higher categories), which is on a separate page.  But it is related: properly done, two $n$-categories are equivalent if and only if they\'re equivalent as objects in the $(n+1)$-category of $n$-categories.


## In homotopy theory #

In the category of topological spaces, notions weaker than isomorphism become very important: [[homotopy equivalence]] and [[weak homotopy equivalence]].  The latter notion is generalized to [[weak equivalence]] for objects in any [[model category]].  There is also a notion of equivalence between model categories: [[Quillen equivalence]].  

These can be understood to some extent using higher categories.  For example, topological spaces should be weakly homotopy-equivalent if and only if they have equivalent [[fundamental infinity-groupoid|fundamental infinity-groupoids]].  Similarly, Quillen equivalent model categories give rise to equivalent [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].
