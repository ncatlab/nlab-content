## Idea

What is called _locally covariant perturbative (algebraic) quantum field theory_ ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00](#BrunettiFredenhagen00), [Brunetti-Fredenhagen-Verch 03](#BrunettiFredenhagenVerch03)) is a formulation of [[local quantum field theory|local]] [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] on general [[spacetimes]] (hence on general [[classical field theory|classical]] [[background field]] configurations of the field theory of [[gravity]]) which is both mathematically rigorous as well as closely connected to the traditional non-rigorous discussions.

The approach uses the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] for [[algebraic quantum field theory]] in a variant that demands only [[formal power series]] [[star-algebras]] [[algebra of observables|of observables]] instead of [[C*-algebras]] (this reflects the [[perturbation theory]]) and which evaluates [[local nets of observables]] not just on causal subspaces of [[Minkowski spacetime]] but on all [[globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds]] (this reflects the extension to general curved spacetimes). 

What connects this to the traditional discussion of QFT is the observation (in essence already due to [Il'in-Slavnov 78](#IlinSlavnov78) but then ignored) that standard [[renormalization]] theory (removal of ultraviolet divergencies) in the guise of [[causal perturbation theory]] ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73), [Scharf 95](#Scharf95)) automatically produces [[local nets]] of [[algebras of observables]], in fact that considering these local nets instead of their would-be colimiting global algebra removes also the infrared divergencies from the theory.



To put this into perspective, notice that formulation of [[quantum field theory]] has many aspects and perspectives. Two almost complementary threads are the following:

**1) [[perturbation theory]] by means of [[formal geometry|formal]] [[Feynman diagram]] expansions of ([[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]]) [[path integrals]]**

   This is the approach predominant in [[phenomenology]]. 

   It produces the [[observable]] [[numbers]] which are checked to great precision in [[experiments]] starting from the early development of [[quantum electrodynamics]], fully established with the success of [[quantum chromodynamics]] and recently culminating in the [[Higgs field]] physics seen at the [[LHC]] experiment, confirming the [[standard model of particle physics]].

   While many of the mathematical intricacies of this approach have found solutions over the decades, most of these rely on global properties of [[Minkowski spacetime]] such as translation invariance and existence of an invariant [[vacuum]] [[quantum state]], hence on a consistent concept of [[particles]]. None of this generalizes robustly to [[quantum field theory on curved spacetimes]] of relevance in [[cosmology]], [[black hole radiation]] or the [[instanton in QCD|instanton vacuum of QCD]].


**2) [[algebraic quantum field theory]] by means of [[local nets]] of [[C*-algebras]] of [[observables]]**

   This is the approach predominant in [[mathematical physics]]. 

   It produces the structural [[theorems]] of quantum field theory, such as the [[PCT theorem]] and the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and it seamlessly generalizes to [[QFT on curved spacetimes]].

   In its insistence on [[C*-algebras]] its ambition is to describe the full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] quantum field theory. But as a matter of fact not a single relevant example ([[interaction|interacting]] QFT in spacetime dimensions 4 or greater) is known. Indeed, the construction of the motivating example, [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]], is one of the open "millenium problems".

$\,$

Locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory provides a synthesis of these two opposites.

$\,$

Besides it being just perturbative (in [[Planck's constant]]), there remains just one problem: 

When applied to [[gauge theory]] on [[quantum field theory on curved spacetime|on curved spacetime]] the usual axioms on a [[local net]] break: either they enforce all [[characteristic classes]] of the [[gauge field]] ("[[instanton sectors]]") to be trivial, or else the axioms encoding locality are broken (see [Schenkel 14](#Schenkel14), [Schreiber 14](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Higher+field+bundles+for+gauge+fields)).

This remaining problem is meant to be solved by passing from plain [[algebras of observables]] to [[homotopical algebra|homotopical algebras]] ([[higher algebra|higher algebras]]), and hence to a formulation of **[[homotopical algebraic quantum field theory]]** (see [Schenkel 17](#Schenkel17)). This is still in the making.


## Global picture

Quantum field theory is extremely rich in phenomena and its formulation involves a plethora of mathematical aspects, such as [[Lorentzian geometry]], [[spin geometry]], [[variational calculus]], [[quantization]] (specifically [[formal  deformation quantization]] for [[perturbative quantum field theory]]) [[functional analysis]] (specifically [[microcausal analysis]] for [[causal perturbation theory]]) and [[operator algebra]]. While lcpAQFT is mathematically rigorous, hence unambiguous and precise, it remains a long story from its first principles to the computation of [[scattering amplitudes]]. To ease the overview, we here indicate the global structure of the topic first.

The input datum is a [[local field theory|local]] [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[classical field theory]] on [[gravity]] [[background fields|backgrounds]], hence a [[natural transformation]] from ([[globally hyperbolic spacetimes|globally hyperbolic]]) [[Lorentzian manifolds]] to [[field bundles]] over these spacetimes equipped with a [[local Lagrangian density]] on their [[jet bundle]].

This induces for each Lorentzian spacetime the corresponding [[covariant phase space]], a (pre-)[[symplectic space|symplectic]] [[smooth space]]. 

The output is a [[formal deformation quantization]] of a sufficiently large subalgebra of the [[algebra of functions]] on the covariant phase space.

There are choices to be made in finding this deformation quantization, and these turn out involve the choices otherwise known as [[renormalization]] coefficients.
