## Idea

A _formal group_ is a [[group object]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[infinitesimal space]]s. More general than [[Lie algebra]]s, which are group objects in _first order infinitesimal_ spaces, formal groups may be of arbitrary infinitesimal order. They sit between [[Lie algebra]]s and finite [[Lie group]]s or [[algebraic group]]s.

Since [[infinitesimal space]]s are typically modeled as [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] to [[algebra]]s, formal groups are typically conceived as group objects in formal duals to [[power series]] algebras.

### Formal group laws

One of the oldest formalisms is the formalism of 
**formal group laws** (early study by Bochner and Lazard), which are a version of representing a group operation in terms of coefficients of the formal power series rings. A __formal group law of dimension__ $n$ is given by a set of $n$ power series $F_i$ of $2n$ variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n$ such that (in notation $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$, $F(x,y) = (F_1(x,y),\ldots,F_n(x,y))$) 

$$
F(x,F(y,z))=F(F(x,y),z)
$$

$$
F_i(x,y) = x_i+y_i+\,\,higher\,\,order\,\,terms
$$

Formal group laws of dimension $1$ proved to be important in [[algebraic topology]], especially in the study of [[cobordism]], starting with the works of Novikov, Buchstaber and Quillen; among the generalized cohomology theories the complex cobordism is characterized by the so-called universal group law; moreover the usage is recently paralleled in the theory of [[algebraic cobordism]] of Morel and Levine in [[algebraic geometry]].  Formal groups are also useful in local class field theory; they can be used to explicitly construct the local Artin map according to Lubin and Tate.



### Formal group schemes

Much more general are **formal group schemes** from ([Grothendieck](#Grothendieck))


__Formal group schemes__ are simply the [[group object]]s in a category of [[formal schemes]]; however usually only the case of the formal spectra of complete $k$-algebras is considered; this category is equivalent to the category of complete cocommutative $k$-[[Hopf algebras]]. 

### Formal groups over an operad

For a generalization over [[operads]] see ([Fresse](#Fresse)).

## Examples

* [[Artin-Mazur formal group]]


## Related concepts

* [[Lie algebra]], [[Lie group]]

* [[formal groupoid]]

Formal geometry is closely related also to the [[rigid analytic geometry]].


(nlab remark: we should explain connections to the Witt rings, Cartier/Dieudonné modules).
