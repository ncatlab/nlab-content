## Idea

A _formal group_ is a [[group object]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[infinitesimal space]]s. More general than [[Lie algebra]]s, which are group objects in _first order infinitesimal_ spaces, formal groups may be of arbitrary infinitesimal order. They sit between [[Lie algebras]] and finite [[Lie groups]] or [[algebraic groups]].

Since [[infinitesimal spaces]] are typically modeled as [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] to [[algebras]], formal groups are typically conceived as group objects in formal duals to [[formal power series]] algebras.

Specifically, fixing a formal [[coordinate]] chart, then the product operation of a formal group is entirely expressed as a [[formal power series]] in two variables, satisfying conditions. This is called a _formal group law_, a concept that goes back to Bochner and [[Daniel Lazard|Lazard]].

Commutative formal group laws of dimension 1 notably appear in [[algebraic topology]] (originating in work by [[Sergei Novikov|Novikov]], [[Victor Buchstaber|Buchstaber]] and [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]], see [Adams 74, part II](#Adams74)), where they express the behaviour of [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] evaluated on infinite [[complex projective space]] (i.e. on the [[classifying space]] $B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty$). In parrticular [[complex cobordism]] cohomology theory in this context gives the universal formal group law represented by the [[Lazard ring]]. The [[height of a formal group|height of formal groups]] induces a filtering on [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] called the _[[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic filtration]]_.

More recently [[Fabien Morel|Morel]] and [[Marc Levine]] consider the [[algebraic cobordism]] of  in [[algebraic geometry]].  Formal groups are also useful in local [[class field theory]]; they can be used to explicitly construct the local Artin map according to Lubin and Tate.


### Formal group laws
 {#FormalGroupLaw}

+-- {: .num_defn #AdicRing}
###### Definition

An (commutative) [[adic ring]] is a ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[topological ring]] $A$ and an ideal $I \subset A$ such that

1. the [[topological space|topology]] on $A$ is the $I$-[[adic topology]];

1. the canonical morphism

   $$
     A \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n (A/I^n)
   $$

   to the [[limit]] over [[quotient rings]] by powers of the ideal is an [[isomorphism]].

A [[homomorphism]] of adic rings is a ring [[homomorphism]] that is also a [[continuous function]] (hence a function that preserves the filtering $A \supset \cdots \supset A/I^2 \supset A/I $). This gives a category $AdicRing$ and a subcategory $AdicCRing$ of commutative adic rings.

The [[opposite category]] of $AdicRing$ (on [[Noetherian rings]]) is that of affine [[formal schemes]].

Similarly, for $R$ any fixed [[commutative ring]], then adic rings under $R$ are _adic $R$-algebras_. We write $Adic A Alg$ and $Adic A CAlg$ for the corresponding categories.

+-- {: .num_example #PowerSeriesAlgebra}
###### Example

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then the [[formal power series ring]]

$$
  R[ [ x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n ] ]
$$

in $n$ [[variables]] with [[coefficients]] in $R$ and equipped with the ideal

$$
  I = (x_1, \cdots , x_n)
$$

is an adic ring (def. \ref{AdicRing}).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There is a [[fully faithful functor]]

$$
  AdicRing \hookrightarrow ProRing
$$

from [[adic rings]] (def. \ref{AdicRing}) to [[pro-rings]], given by 

$$
  (A,I) \mapsto ( (A/I^{\bullet}))
  \,,
$$

i.e. for $A,B \in AdicRing$ two adic rings, then there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  Hom_{AdicRing}(A,B)
    \simeq
   \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{n_2}
   \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n_1}
   Hom_{Ring}(A/I^{n_1},B/I^{n_2})
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #GroupObjectFormalGroupLaw}
###### Definition

For $R \in CRing$ a [[commutative ring]] and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **formal group law** of dimension $n$ over $R$ is the structure of a [[group object]] in the category $Adic R CAlg^{op}$ from def. \ref{AdicRing} on the object $R [ [x_1, \cdots ,x_n] ]$ from example \ref{PowerSeriesAlgebra}.

Hence this is a morphism

$$
  \mu
  \;\colon\;
  R[ [ x_1, \cdots, x_n ] ]
   \longrightarrow
  R [ [ x_1, \cdots, x_n, \, y_1, \cdots, y_n ] ] 
$$

in $Adic R CAlg$ satisfying unitality, associativity.

This is a **commutative formal group law** if it is an abelian group object, hence if it in addition satisfies the corresponding commutativity condition.

=--

This is equivalently a set of $n$ power series $F_i$ of $2n$ variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n$ such that (in notation $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$, $F(x,y) = (F_1(x,y),\ldots,F_n(x,y))$) 

$$
  F(x,F(y,z))=F(F(x,y),z)
$$

$$
  F_i(x,y) = x_i+y_i+\,\,higher\,\,order\,\,terms
$$


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

A 1-dimensional commutative formal group law according to def. \ref{GroupObjectFormalGroupLaw} is equivalently a [[formal power series]]

$$
  \mu(x,y)
  =
  \underset{i,j \geq 0}{\sum} a_{i,j} x^i y^j
$$

(the [[image]] under $\mu$ in $R[ [ x,y ] ]$ of the element $t \in R [ [ t ] ]$) such that


1. (unitality) 

   $$
     \mu(x,0) = x$ and $\mu(0,x) = x
     \,;
   $$

1. (associativity) 

   $$
     \mu(x,\mu(y,z)) = \mu(\mu(x,y),z)
     \,;
   $$

1. (commutativity) 
  
   $$
     \mu(x,y) = \mu(y,x)
     \,.
   $$

The first condition means equivalently that 

$$
  a_{i,0} 
    = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      1 & if i = 0
      \\
      0 & otherwise 
    }
  \right.
  \;\;\;\;\,,
  \;\;\;\;\;
  a_{0,i} 
    = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      1 & if i = 0
      \\
      0 & otherwise 
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Hence $\mu$ is necessarily of the form

$$
  \mu(x,y)
   \;=\;
   x + y + \underset{i,j \geq 1}{\sum} a_{i,j} x^i y^j
  \,.
$$

The existence of inverses is no extra condition: by [[induction]] on the index $i$ one finds that there exists a unique 

$$
  \iota(x) = \underset{i \geq 1}{\sum} \iota(x)_i x^i
$$

such that 

$$
  \mu(x,iota(x)) = x
  \;\;\;\,,
  \;\;\;
  \mu(\iota(x),x) = x
  \,.
$$

Hence 1-dimensional formal group laws over $R$ are equivalently [[monoids]] in $Adic R CAlg^{op}$ on $R[ [ x ] ]$.

### Formal group schemes

Much more general are **formal group schemes** from ([Grothendieck](#Grothendieck))


__Formal group schemes__ are simply the [[group object]]s in a category of [[formal schemes]]; however usually only the case of the formal spectra of complete $k$-algebras is considered; this category is equivalent to the category of complete cocommutative $k$-[[Hopf algebras]]. 

### Formal groups over an operad

For a generalization over [[operads]] see ([Fresse](#Fresse)).



## Properties

### In characteristic 0

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The quotient [[moduli stack]] $\mathcal{M}_{FG} \times Spec \mathbb{Q}$ of formal group over the [[rational numbers]] is isomorphic to $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m$, the [[delooping]] of the [[multiplicative group]] (over $Spec \mathbb{Q}$). This means that in [[characteristic]] 0 every formal group is determined, up to unique [[isomorphism]], by its [[Lie algebra]].
