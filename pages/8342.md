The term **Chevalley fundamental group** is sometimes used for the fundamental group of a space defined via the automorphisms of a universal cover.


This terminology is used by Borceux and Janeldize in their book on [[Galois Theories]].  To quote from that source:

'' There are two classical definitions of the fundamental group of a topological space which give isomorphic groups for certain ''good'' spaces. \ldots

The Chevalley fundamental group $Aut(p)= Aut(E,p)$ is defined only for connected spaces $B$ which admit a universal covering map $p: E\to B$ with connected $E$, and, of course, depends on it, but again, different $p$ produce isomorphic groups.''

The term_ algebriac fundamental group_ is also sometimes used for this, although more usually that term is reserved for Grothendieck's fundamental group of  a scheme.
