## Idea

[[fiber integration|Fiber integration]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] is the partial [[higher parallel transport|higher]] [[holonomy]] operation for [[circle n-bundles with connection]]:

for $Y \to X$ a [[bundle]] of [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]]s $S$ of [[dimension]] $k$ and $[\nabla] \in H_{diff}^n(Y)$ a class in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of degree $n$ on $Y$, its [[fiber integration]]

$$
  \left[\exp(i \int_{Y/X} \nabla)\right] \in H^{n-k}_{diff}(X)
$$

is a differential cohomology class on $X$ of degree $k$ less.

In the particular case that $X = *$ is the [[point]] and $dim Y = k = n-1$ the element

$$
  \exp(i \int_{Y} \nabla) \in H^{1}_{diff}(*) \simeq U(1)
$$

is the [[higher parallel transport|higher]] [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over $Y$.

## Definition


### Differential orientation

The operation of [[fiber integration]] in [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] requires a choice of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]]. For fiber integration in [[differential cohomology]] this is to be refined to a _differential orientation_ .

Accordingly, instead of a [[Thom class]] there is a _differential Thom class_ .

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] and $V \to X$ a smooth real [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $k$ a **differential Thom cocycle** on $V$ is

* a compactly supported cocycle $\hat \omega$ in the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of degree $k$ of $V$;

* such that for each $x \in X$ we have 
  
  $$
    \int_{V_x} \omega = \pm 1
    \,.
  $$

###### Remark

The underlying class $[\hat \omega] \in H^{k}_{compact}(V, \mathbb{Z})$ in compactly supported [[integral cohomology]] is an ordinary [[Thom class]] for $V$.

###### Definition

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a [[smooth function]] of [[smooth manifold]]s.

An **$H \mathbb{Z}_{diff}$-orientation** on $p$ is

1. A factorization through an [[embedding of smooth manifolds]] 

   $$
     p : X \hookrightarrow Y \times \mathbb{R}^N \stackrel{}{\to} Y
   $$

   for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. a [[tubular neighbourhood]] $W \hookrightarrow Y \times \mathbb{R}^N$ of $X$;

1. a differential Thom cocycle, def. \ref{DifferentialThomCocycle}, $U$ on $W \to X$.

This appears as ([HopkinsSinger, def. 2.9](#HopkinsSinger)).


### Fiber integration

Write $\mathbf{H}^n_{diff}(-)$ for the (a) [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]] of [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. For either choice, there is a fairly evident fiber integration of compactly supported cocycles along trivial Cartesian bundles $Y \times \mathbb{R}^N \to Y$ over a [[compact space|compact]] $Y$:

$$
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} 
   : \mathbf{H}^{n+N}_{diff,cpt}(Y \times \mathbb{R}^n)
  \to
  \mathbf{H}^n_{diff}(Y)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $X \to Y$ be a smooth function equipped with differential $H\mathbb{Z}$-orientation $U$, def. \ref{DifferentialOrientation}. Then the corresponding **fiber integration** of ordinary differential cohomology is the composite

$$
  \int_{X/Y} :
   \mathbf{H}_{diff}^{n+k}(X)
   \stackrel{(-)\cup U}{\to}
   \mathbf{H}_{diff, cpt}^{n+N}(X \times \mathbb{R}^N)
   \stackrel{\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}}{\to}
   \mathbf{H}_{diff}^n(Y)
  \,.
$$

### Abstract formulation

At least the fiber integration all the way to the point exists on general grounds for the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#DifferentialCohomology">intrinsic differential cohomology</a> in any [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]: the general abstract formulation is in the section _<a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#ChernSimonsTheory">Higher holonomy and Chern-Simons functional</a>_ and the implementation in [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s is in the section _<a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#StrucChernSimons">Smooth higher holonomy and Chern-Simons functional</a>_ .
