## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _vacuum state_ is supposed to be a [[quantum state]] that expresses the absence of any [[particle]] excitations of the fields.

On [[Minkowski spacetime]] the _vacuum state_ for a [[free field theory]] is the standard [[Hadamard state]]. On general [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]] there are always [[Hadamard states]], and they do play the role of the vacuum state in  the construction of [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]], see at _[[locally covariant perturbative AQFT]]_. Notably the choice of such a Hadamard state fixes the _[[Feynman propagator]]_, hence the [[time-ordered product]] of [[quantum observables]] and thus the [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[S-matrix]] away from coinciding interaction points (the [[extension of distributions|extension of these distributions]] to coinciding interaction points is the process of [[renormalization]]).

However, since on a general [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] there is no globally well-defined concept of [[particles]], there is in general no concept of vacuum state. But under good conditions (such as existence of suitable [[timelike]] [[Killing vectors]]) one may identify Hadamard states which deserve to be thought of as vacuum states ([Brum-Fredenhagen 13](#BrumFredenhagen13)).
