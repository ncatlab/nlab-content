## Idea

A _transfer context_ is an abstract context of [[linear homotopy-type theory]] in which the concept of [[Becker-Gottlieb transfer]] makes sense.

## Definition

A _transfer context_ according to ([Haugseng 13, def. 4.9](#Haugseng13)) is a [[Wirthmüller context]] $(f_! \dashv f^\ast \dashv f_\ast)$ of [[six operations]] in which not only $f_!$ but also $f_\ast$ satisfies its [[projection formula]].

This induces an abstract [[Becker-Gottlieb transfer]]/[[Umkehr map]] by ([Haugseng 13, prop.  4.14](#Haugseng13))
