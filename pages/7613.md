## Idea

There are various hints (originally observed in [Witten 95](#Witten95)) that all [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[superstring theories]] ([[type II string theory|type II]] (A and B), [[type I string theory|type I]], [[heterotic string theory|heterotic]] ($SO(32)$ and $E_8 \times E_8$)) have a joint [[coupling constant|strong coupling]] [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] limit whose low energy [[effective field theory]] description is [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and which reduces to the various string theories by [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] on an [[orientifold]] torus bundle, followed by various [[duality in string theory|string dualities]]. Since the string itself is thought to arise from a [[membrane]]/[[M2-brane]] in 11-dimensions after [[double dimensional reduction]] this hypothetical theory has been called "M-theory" short for "membrane theory"; e.g. in [Horava-Witten 95](#HoravaWitten95):

> As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the _M-theory_, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes.

The "reasons to doubt" that interpretation is that the [[M2-brane]] does not support a [[perturbation theory]] the way that the [[superstring]] does. This is part of the reason why the actual nature of "M-theory" remains mysterious. On the other hand, later it was argued that there is a regularization of the M2-brane worldvolume theory, which makes it becomes the [[BFSS matrix model]] ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). In reaction to these developments it was suggested that "M-theory" could be read as "matrix theory".

> Later, the membranes were interpreted in terms of matrices. Purely by chance, the word "matrix" also starts with "m", so for a while I would say that the M stands for magic, mystery, or matrix. ([Witten 14, last paragraph](#Witten14))

The defining characteristic of M-theory is that it exhibits [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory|duality with type IIA string theory]] in the following way:


$$
  \array{
      M-Theory(?) &\stackrel{low\;energy\;limit}{\to}& 11d Supergravity
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{ \array{ small \\ coupling \\ limit}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ \array{KK\;reduction \\ on S^1 }}}
      \\
      type IIA string theory 
        &\stackrel{low\;energy\;effective\;QFT}{\to}&  
      10d Supergravity
  }
$$

(see also e.g. ([Obers-Pioline 98, p. 12](#ObersPioline98))). The unknown top left corner here has optimistically been given a name, and that is "M-theory". But even the rough global structure of the top left corner has remained elusive. 

> We still have no fundamental formulation of "[[M-theory]]" - the hypothetical theory of which [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and the five [[string theories]] are all special limiting cases. Work on formulating the fundamental principles underlying M-theory has noticeably waned. $[...]$. If history is a good guide, then we should expect that anything as profound and far-reaching as a fully satisfactory formulation of M-theory is surely going to lead to new and novel mathematics. Regrettably, it is a problem the community seems to have put aside - temporarily. But, ultimately, Physical Mathematics must return to this grand issue.

## Hints

The available evidence that there is something of interest consists of various facets of the bottom left and the top right entry of the above diagram, that seem to have a common origin in the top left corner.

### Membranes

Notably, from the [[black brane]]-solution structure in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and from the [[brane scan]] one finds that it contains a 2-[[brane]], called the _[[M2-brane]]_, and to the extent that one has this under control one can show that under "double dimensional reduction" this becomes the [[string]]. However, it is clear that this cannot quite give a definition of the top left corner by [[perturbation theory]] as the [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]] does for the bottom left corner. At the bottom of it,  this is simply because, by the very nature of the conjecture, the top left corner is supposed to be given by a non-perturbative strong-coupling limit of the bottom left corner. But one may also see that the evident guess for a would-be membrane analog of the [[string perturbation series]] fails

> {#WittenOnProblemsOfMembraneTheory2014} [[Mike Duff]], [[Paul Townsend]], and other physicists working on [[supermembranes]] had spent a couple of years in the mid-1980s saying that there should be a theory of fundamental membranes analogous to the theory of fundamental strings. That wasn't convincing for a large number of reasons. For one thing, a three-manifold doesn't have an [[Euler characteristic]], so there isn't a topological expansion as there is in string theory. Moreover, in three dimensions there is no [[conformal invariance]] to help us make sense of membrane theory; membrane theory is [[renormalization|nonrenormalizable]] just like [[general relativity]].

Amer. Math. Soc, May 2015 p491 ([pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/201505/rnoti-p491.pdf)))

This issue is the very root of the abbreviation "M-theory":

> As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the _M-theory_, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes. ([Horava-Witten 95](#HoravaWitten95))

> {#Witten14LastParagraph} M-theory was meant as a temporary name pending a better understanding. Some colleagues thought that the theory should be understood as a membrane theory. Though I was skeptical, I decided to keep the letter "m" from "membrane" and call the theory M--theory, with time to tell whether the M stands for magic, mystery, or membrane. Later, the membranes were interpreted in terms of matrices. Purely by chance, the word "matrix" also starts with "m", so for a while I would say that the M stands for magic, mystery, or matrix. ([Witten 14, last paragraph](#Witten14))


### Strongly coupled type IIA strings and D$0$-branes
 {#StronglyCoupledTypeIIAAndD0Branes}

There is a bunch of consistency checks on the statement that the [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle gives the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling]] refinement of [[type IIA string theory]]. See at _[[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]]_.

One aspect of this is that [[type IIA string theory]] with a [[condensate]] of [[D0-branes]] behaves like a 10-dimensional theory that develops a further circular dimension of [[radius]] scaling with the density of [[D0-branes]].  ([Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind 97](#BanksFischlerShenkerSusskind97), [Polchinski 99](#Polchinski99)). See also ([FSS 13, section 4.2](#FSS13)).

Discussion of the relation of [[gauge enhancement]] of M-theory at [[ADE singularities]] and the corresponding coincident [[D-brane]] geometries in type IIA string theory is in ([Sen 97](#Sen97)).

More on the decomposition of the [[nLab:supergravity C-field]] in 11d to the [[RR-fields]] and the NS-fields in type IIA is in ([Mathai-Sati 03, section 4](#MathaiSati03)).

For survey of how the components maps see also the table at _[Relation to F-theory](#RelationToFTheory)_.

### U-duality

Another hint comes from the fact that the [[U-duality]]-structure of [[supergravity]] theories forms a clear pattern in those dimensions where one understands it well, giving rise to a description of higher dimensional supergravity theories by [[exceptional generalized geometry]]. Now, this pattern, as a mathematical pattern, can be continued to the case that would correspond to the top left corner above, by passing to [[exceptional generalized geometry]] over _hyperbolic_ [[Kac-Moody Lie algebras]] such as first [[E10]] and then, ultimately [[E11]]. The references there show that these are huge algebraic structures inside which people incrementally find all kinds of relations that are naturally identified with various aspects of M-theory. This leads to the conjecture that M-theory somehow _is_ $E_{11}$ in some way. But it all remains rather mysterious at the moment.

### Relation to F-theory
 {#RelationToFTheory}

The [[KK-compactification|compactification]] of M-theory on a torus yields [[type II string theory]] -- directly type IIA, and then type IIB after [[T-duality|T-dualizing]]. It turns out that the [[axio-dilaton]] of the resulting type II-B string theory is equivalently the [[complex structure]]-[[moduli|modulus]] of this [[elliptic fibration]] by the compactification torus. This gives a description of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] aspects of type II which has come to be known as _[[F-theory]]_ (see e.g. [Johnson 97](#Johnson97)).
 
In slightly more detail, write, topologically, $T^2 = S^1_A\times S^1_B$ for the compactification torus of M-theory, where contracting the first $S^1_A$-factor means passing to type IIA. To obtain type IIB in noncompact 10 dimensions from M-theory,  also the second $S^1_B$ is to be compactified (since [[T-duality]] sends the radius $r_A$ of $S^1_A$ to the inverse radius $r_B = \ell_s^2 / R_A$ of $S^1_B$).
Therefore type IIB sugra in $d = 10$ is obtained from 11d sugra compactified on the [[torus]] $S^1_A \times S^1_B$. More generally, this torus may be taken to be an [[elliptic curve]] and this may vary over the 9d base space as an [[elliptic fibration]]. 

Applying T-duality to one of the compact direction yields a 10-dimensional theory which may now be thought of as encoded by a 12-dimensional elliptic fibration. This 12d elliptic fibration encoding a 10d type II supergravity [[vacuum]] is the input data that [[F-theory]] is concerned with.

A schematic depiction of this story is the following:

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| [[11d supergravity|M-theory]] in $d = 11$ | | F-theory in $d = 12$ |
| $\downarrow$ [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] along [[elliptic fibration]] | | $\downarrow$ [[axio-dilaton]] is modulus of [[elliptic fibration]] |
| [[type IIA string theory|IIA string theory]] in $d = 9$ | $\leftarrow$[[T-duality]]$\rightarrow$ | [[type IIB string theory|IIB string theory]] in $d = 10$ |

In the simple case where the elliptic fiber is indeed just $S^1_A \times S^1_B$, the [[imaginary part]] of its complex modulus is

$$
  Im(\tau) = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
  \,.
$$

By following through the above diagram, one finds how this determines the [[coupling constant]] in the [[type II string theory]]:

First, the [[KK-compactification]] of M-theory on $S^1_A$ yields a type IIA [[string coupling constant]]

$$
  g_{IIA} = \frac{R_A}{\ell_s}
  \,.
$$

Then the T-duality operation along $S^1_B$ divides this by $R_B$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g_{IIB} & = g_{IIA} \frac{\ell_s}{R_B} 
    \\
    & = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
    \\
    & = Im(\tau)
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

### Cohomological properties

A derivation of [[D-brane charge]], [[RR-fields]] and other [[K-theory]] structure in [[type II superstring theory]] from M-theory was argued in ([FMW 00](#FMW00)).

See also at _[[cubical structure in M-theory]]_.

### Kaluza-Klein compactifications

[[!include KK-compactifications of M-theory -- table]]


### Via AdS/CFT

The [[AdS-CFT duality]] for the [[black brane|black]][[M5-brane]] may be turned around to deduce from the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[M5-brane]] [[scattering amplitudes]] in the 11-dimensional [[bulk]]-spacetime, hence in putative M-theory. While the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] is not completely known, [[conformal invariance]] and [[supersymmetry]] tightly constrains it ("[[conformal bootstrap]]") and does allow to extract results.

This approach to computing putative M-theory scattering amplitudes is due to  ([ChesterPerlmutter18](#ChesterPerlmutter18)).

## The open problem of formulating M-theory
 {#TheOpenProblem}

The tight web of hints and plausiblity checks notwithstanding, an actual formulation of M-theory as an actual [[theory (physics)|theory]] remains an open problem. 

This is not outrageous in itself: In [[mathematics]] there are good examples of cases where a collection of situations was or is suspected to be limiting cases of a single unified theory, without that theory itself having been or being known. 

One example of this is the putative theory "absolute geometry over the [[field with one element]]". In this [[analogy]], the various [[perturbative string theories]] ([[heterotic string theory|HET]], [[type I string theory|I]], [[type IIA string theory|IIA]], [[type IIB string theory|IIB]] and their [[KK-compactifications]]) correspond to [[arithmetic geometry|arithmetic geometries]] over [[ground field|base]] [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p \geq 2$, and the would-be M-theory corresponds to a  theory of a "[[field with one element]]" that unifies all this, by describing it at a deeper level (literally: a deeper base). 

On the other hand, parts of the physics-minded literature tends to forget or downplay the [[conjecture|conjectural]] nature of many assumptions or leaps of faiths that are being made when it comes to discussion of [[D-brane]]/[[M-brane]] dynamics and generally of [[non-perturbative effects]] in string theory.

What little is known of M theory is powerful enough to lead us to new phenomena in string theory and indeed new string theories.  In particular the M theory fivebrane is strongly believed hold a new kind of self-dual string theory on its worldvolume. This new and somewhat elusive theory has also appeared in other contexts such as the compactification of type IIB string theory on K3 , M(atrix) theory on $\mathbb{T}^5$ and the S-duality of $N = 4$, $D = 4$ super-Yang-Mills. Thus one may hope that a greater understanding of this self-dual string may lead directly to a greater understanding of duality, string theory and M theory.

There are still too many ingredients missing that we would expect the final theory to possess. For one thing, we would expect a true theory of quantum gravity to exhibit certain pregeometrical features corresponding to a “dissolution” of space-time and the emergence of some kind of non-commutative geometry at short distances; although the matrix model does achieve that to some extent by replacing commuting coordinates by non-commuting matrices, it seems to us that a still more radical departure from conventional ideas about space and time may be required in order to arrive at a truly background independent formulation (the matrix model “lives” in nine _flat_ transverse dimensions only). Furthermore, there should exist some huge and so far completely hidden symmetries generalizing not only the duality symmetries of extended supergravity and string theory, but also the principles underlying general relativity.

We have every reason to expect that this theory produces the correct [[scattering amplitudes]] of modes in the [[11-dimensional supergravity]] multiplet in 11-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] - even at energies sufficiently large that [[black holes]] should be created. (This latter phenomenon has never been explicitly demonstrated). But [[BFSS matrix model|Matrix theory]] is only a beginning and does not give us the whole picture of [[M-theory]]. The program ran into increasing technical difficulties when more complicated [[KK-compactification|compactifications]] were investigated. (For example, compactification on a six-dimensional torus is not very well understood at all. $[...]$). Moreover, to my mind, as it has thus far been practiced it has an important flaw: It has not led to much significant new mathematics.

which coined the association

### In terms of higher geometry

See also the references at _[[exceptional generalized geometry]]_. 

In fact, much of the broad structure of M-theory and its relation to the various [[string theory]] limits can be seen from the classification of exceptional [[super L-∞ algebras]] (such as the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] and the [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]), as discussed in
