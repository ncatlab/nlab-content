## Idea

There are various hints (originally observed in [Witten 95](#Witten95)) that all [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[superstring theories]] ([[type II string theory|type II]] (A and B), [[type I string theory|type I]], [[heterotic string theory|heterotic]] ($SO(32)$ and $E_8 \times E_8$)) have a joint [[coupling constant|strong coupling]] [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] limit whose low energy [[effective field theory]] description is [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and which reduces to the various string theories by [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] on an [[orientifold]] torus bundle, followed by various [[duality in string theory|string dualities]]. Since the string itself is thought to arise from a [[membrane]]/[[M2-brane]] in 11-dimensions after [[double dimensional reduction]] this hypothetical theory has been called "M-theory" short for "membrane theory"; e.g. in [Hořava-Witten 95](#HoravaWitten95):

> As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes.

The "reasons to doubt" that interpretation is that the [[M2-brane]] certainly does not support a [[perturbation theory]] the way that the [[superstring]] does. This is part of the reason why the actual nature of "M-theory" remains mysterious.

Keeping in mind that already [[string theory]] itself and in fact already [[quantum field theory]] itself have only partially been formulated in a precise way, the conjecture is motivated from the fact that with the available knowledge of these subjects -- particularly from [[duality in string theory]] -- one can see indications that there is a kind of [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
      ??? &\stackrel{low\;energy\;limit}{\to}& 11d Supergravity
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{dimensional\;reduction}}
      \\
      StringTheory &\stackrel{low\;energy\;effective\;QFT}{\to}& 10d Supergravity
  }
$$

in some sense (see also e.g. ([Obers-Pioline 98, p. 12](#ObersPioline98))). The unknown top left corner here has optimistically been given a name, and that is "M-theory". But even the rough global structure of the top left corner has remained elusive. 

## Hints

The available evidence that there is something of interest consists of various facets of the bottom left and the top right entry of the above diagram, that seem to have a common origin in the top left corner.

### Membranes

Notably, from the [[black brane]]-solution structure in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and from the [[brane scan]] one finds that it contains a 2-[[brane]], called the _[[M2-brane]]_, and to the extent that one has this under control one can show that under "double dimensional reduction" this becomes the [[string]]. However, it is clear that this cannot quite give a definition of the top left corner by [[perturbation theory]] as the [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]] does for the bottom left corner,  because by the very nature of the conjecture, the top left corner is supposed to be given by a non-perturbative strong-coupling limit of the bottom left corner.

### Strongly coupled type IIA strings and D0-branes
 {#StronglyCoupledTypeIIAAndD0Branes}

There is a bunch of consistency checks on the statement that the [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle gives the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling]] refinement of [[type IIA string theory]].

One aspect of this is that [[type IIA string theory]] with a [[condensate]] of [[D0-branes]] behaves like a 10-dimensional theory that develops a further circular dimension of [[radius]] scaling with the density of [[D0-branes]].  ([Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind 97](#BanksFischlerShenkerSusskind97), [Polchinski 99](#Polchinski99)). See also ([FSS 13, section 4.2](#FSS13)).

Discussion of the relation of [[gauge enhancement]] of M-theory at [[ADE singularities]] and the corresponding coincident [[D-brane]] geometries in type IIA string theory is in ([Sen 97](#Sen97)).

More on the decomposition of the [[nLab:supergravity C-field]] in 11d to the [[RR-fields]] and the NS-fields in type IIA is in ([Mathai-Sati 03, section 4](#MathaiSati03)).

For survey of how the components maps see also the table at _[Relation to F-theory](#RelationToFTheory)_.

### U-duality

Another hint comes from the fact that the [[U-duality]]-structure of [[supergravity]] theories forms a clear pattern in those dimensions where one understands it well, giving rise to a description of higher dimensional supergravity theories by [[exceptional generalized geometry]]. Now, this pattern, as a mathematical pattern, can be continued to the case that would correspond to the top left corner above, by passing to [[exceptional generalized geometry]] over _hyperbolic_ [[Kac-Moody Lie algebras]] such as first [[E10]] and then, ultimately [[E11]]. The references there show that these are huge algebraic structures inside which people incrementally find all kinds of relations that are naturally identified with various aspects of M-theory. This leads to the conjecture that M-theory somehow _is_ $E_{11}$ in some way. But it all remains rather mysterious at the moment.

### Relation to F-theory
 {#RelationToFTheory}

The [[KK-compactification|compactification]] of M-theory on a torus yields [[type II string theory]] -- directly type IIA, and then type IIB after [[T-duality|T-dualizing]]. It turns out that the [[axio-dilaton]] of the resulting type II-B string theory is equivalently the [[complex structure]]-[[moduli|modulus]] of this [[elliptic fibration]] by the compactification torus. This gives a description of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] aspects of type II which has come to be known as _[[F-theory]]_ (see e.g. [Johnson 97](#Johnson97)).
 
In slightly more detail, write, topologically, $T^2 = S^1_A\times S^1_B$ for the compactification torus of M-theory, where contracting the first $S^1_A$-factor means passing to type IIA. To obtain type IIB in noncompact 10 dimensions from M-theory,  also the second $S^1_B$ is to be compactified (since [[T-duality]] sends the radius $r_A$ of $S^1_A$ to the inverse radius $r_B = \ell_s^2 / R_A$ of $S^1_B$).
Therefore type IIB sugra in $d = 10$ is obtained from 11d sugra compactified on the [[torus]] $S^1_A \times S^1_B$. More generally, this torus may be taken to be an [[elliptic curve]] and this may vary over the 9d base space as an [[elliptic fibration]]. 

Applying T-duality to one of the compact direction yields a 10-dimensional theory which may now be thought of as encoded by a 12-dimensional elliptic fibration. This 12d elliptic fibration encoding a 10d type II supergravity [[vacuum]] is the input data that [[F-theory]] is concerned with.

A schematic depiction of this story is the following:

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| [[11d supergravity|M-theory]] in $d = 11$ | | F-theory in $d = 12$ |
| $\downarrow$ [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] along [[elliptic fibration]] | | $\downarrow$ [[axio-dilaton]] is modulus of [[elliptic fibration]] |
| [[type IIA string theory|IIA string theory]] in $d = 9$ | $\leftarrow$[[T-duality]]$\rightarrow$ | [[type IIB string theory|IIB string theory]] in $d = 10$ |

In the simple case where the elliptic fiber is indeed just $S^1_A \times S^1_B$, the [[imaginary part]] of its complex modulus is

$$
  Im(\tau) = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
  \,.
$$

By following through the above diagram, one finds how this determines the [[coupling constant]] in the [[type II string theory]]:

First, the KK-reduction of M-theory on $S^1_A$ yields a type IIA string coupling

$$
  g_{IIA} = \frac{R_A}{\ell_s}
  \,.
$$

Then the T-duality operation along $S^1_B$ divides this by $R_B$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g_{IIB} & = g_{IIA} \frac{\ell_s}{R_B} 
    \\
    & = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
    \\
    & = Im(\tau)
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

### In terms of higher geometry

Discussion of phenomena of M-theory in [[higher geometry]] and [[generalized cohomology]] is in 

* [[Hisham Sati]], _[[Geometric and topological structures related to M-branes]]_ (2010)

See also the references at _[[exceptional generalized geometry]]_. 

In fact, much of the broad structure of M-theory and its relation to the various [[string theory]] limits can be seen from the classification of exceptional [[super L-∞ algebras]] (such as the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] and the [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]), as discussed in 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:The brane bouquet|Super Lie n-algebra extensions, higher WZW models and super p-branes with tensor multiplet fields]]_ ([arXiv:1308.5264](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5264))
 {#FSS13}

By passing to [[automorphism]] algebras, this reproduces the polyvector extensions of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]], which enter the traditional discussion of M-theory, such as the [[M-theory super Lie algebra]] (which arises as the symmetries of the [[M5-brane]] [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory]]).
