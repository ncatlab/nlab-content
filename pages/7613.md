## Idea

The term  _M-theory_ refers to a conjectured [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[UV-completion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] whose [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensional reduction]] yields [[string theory]].

Keeping in mind that already [[string theory]] itself and in fact already [[quantum field theory]] itself have only partially been formulated in a precise way, the conjecture is motivated from the fact that with the available knowledge of these subjects, one can see indications that there is a kind of [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
      ??? &\stackrel{effective QFT}{\to}& 11d Supergravity
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{dimensional reduction}}
      \\
      StringTheory &\stackrel{effective QFT}{\to}& 10d Supergravity
  }
$$

in some sense. The unknown top left corner here has optimistically been given a name, and that is "M-theory". But even the rough global structure of the top left corner has remained elusive. 

## Hints

The available evidence that there is something of interest consists of various facets of the bottom left and the top right entry of the above diagram, that seem to have a common origin in the top left corner.

### Membranes

Notably, from the [[black brane]]-solution structure in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and from the [[brane scan]] one finds that it contains a 2-[[brane]], called the _[[M2-brane]]_, and to the extent that one has this under control one can show that under "double dimensional reduction" this becomes the [[string]]. However, it is clear that this cannot quite give a definition of the top left corner by [[perturbation theory]] as the [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]] does for the bottom left corner,  because by the very nature of the conjecture, the top left corner is supposed to be given by a non-perturbative strong-coupling limit of the bottom left corner.

### Strongly coupled type IIA strings and D0-branes
 {#StronglyCoupledTypeIIAAndD0Branes}

There is a bunch of consistency checks on the statement that the [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle gives the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling]] refinement of [[type IIA string theory]].

One aspect of this is that [[type IIA string theory]] with a [[condensate]] of [[D0-branes]] behaves like a 10-dimensional theory that develops a further circular dimension of [[radius]] scaling with the density of [[D0-branes]].  ([Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind 97](#BanksFischlerShenkerSusskind97), [Polchinski 99](#Polchinski99)). See also ([FSS 13, section 4.2](#FSS13)).

### U-duality

Another hint comes from the fact that the [[U-duality]]-structure of [[supergravity]] theories forms a clear pattern in those dimensions where one understands it well, giving rise to a description of higher dimensional supergravity theories by [[exceptional generalized geometry]]. Now, this pattern, as a mathematical pattern, can be continued to the case that would correspond to the top left corner above, by passing to [[exceptional generalized geometry]] over _hyperbolic_ [[Kac-Moody Lie algebras]] such as first [[E10]] and then, ultimately [[E11]]. The references there show that these are huge algebraic structures inside which people incrementally find all kinds of relations that are naturally identified with various aspects of M-theory. This leads to the conjecture that M-theory somehow _is_ $E_{11}$ in some way. But it all remains rather mysterious at the moment.

A public talk announcing the conjecture that the [[non-perturbative field theory|strong-coupling limit]] of [[type IIA string theory]] is [[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]] on a circle is at 15:12 in

* [[Edward Witten]], talk, 1995(?) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-O3g6MhLUU))

   19:33: "Ten years ago we had the embarrassment that there were five consistent string theories plus a close cousin, which was 11-dimensional supergravity." (19:40): "I promise you that by the end of the talk we have just one big theory."

In fact, much of the broad structure of M-theory and its relation to the various [[string theory]] limits can be seen from the classification of exceptional [[super L-∞ algebras]] (such as the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] and the [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]), as discussed in 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:The brane bouquet|Super Lie n-algebra extensions, higher WZW models and super p-branes with tensor multiplet fields]]_ ([arXiv:1308.5264](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5264))

By passing to [[automorphism]] algebras this reproduces the polyvector extensions of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]], which enter the traditional discussin of M-theoy, such as the [[M-theory super Lie algebra]] (which arises as the symmetries of the [[M5-brane]] [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory]]).
