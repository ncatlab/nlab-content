## Idea

Given a monoid $L$ in a monoidal category, there is an induced monad $T^L$ obtained by tensoring with $L$ from the right. Consider the [[Kleisli category]] of the monad $T^L$. It is not necessarily a monoidal category; there is a need for an additional structure ([[distributive law]] of a sort) in order to make such a lift. If the monoidal category $C$ in question is the monoidal category of left modules over a Hopf algebra $H$, then any commutative algebra $L$ in the center $Z(C)$ provides a canonical lift to the Kleisli category

#### Physical motivation

Dynamical extension or a dynamization of a monoidal category is an abstract framework to aid the construction of so called dynamical quantum groups which are in turn related to [[dynamical quantum Yang-Baxter equation]].

## Properties and remarks

In Donin-Mudrov (2006) a relation to [[bialgebroid]]s has been exhibited.
