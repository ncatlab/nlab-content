## Definition

Given a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] $C$, an **$E_\infty$-algebra** in $C$ is synonymous with a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|commutative monoid]] in $C$.
Most often $C$ is the [[(infinity,1)-category of chain complexes]] over a [[field]] or [[commutative ring]], or the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[spectra]] (see also [[E-infinity ring]]).

In terms of [[operads]], an $E_\infty$-algebra is an [[algebra over an operad]] for an [[E-∞ operad]].


## Realizations

### In chain complexes

$E_\infty$-algebras in [[chain complex|chain complexes]] are equivalent to those in abelian [[simplicial group|simplicial groups]].

For details on this statement see [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] and [[operadic Dold-Kan correspondence]].

The [[singular cohomology]] $H^*(X,\mathbb{Z})$ of a topological space
is a graded-commutative algebra over the integers, but the the [[singular cohomology|singular cochain]] complex $C^*(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is not: instead, it is an $E_\infty$-algebra.

A concrete construction of an $E_\infty$-algebra structure
on [[singular cochains]], and, more generally,
[[simplicial cochains]] of a [[simplicial set]]
can be found in [McClure and Smith](#MCO).
Their work gives a precise description of the involved __sequence operad__, which is an $E_\infty$-operad,
as well as its action on [[simplicial cochains]],
which involves a generalization of Steenrod's cup-$i$ products.
Recall that the cup-1 product controls the noncommutativity of
the ordinary [[cup product]]:
$$d(x\cup_1 y)=x\cup y-(-1)^{|x|\cdot|y|}y\cup x.$$
It can be defined using a formula similar to the one used
for the [[cup product]], and the higher operations
also have similar nature.

Remarkably, for [[simply connected]] spaces of [[finite type]] this $E_\infty$-algebra knows everything about the [[weak homotopy type]] of $X$.  In fact a stronger statement holds:

###### Theorem

Finite type [[nilpotent spaces]] $X$ and $Y$ are [[weak equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] if and only if the $E_\infty$-algebras $C^*(X,\mathbb{Z})$ and $C^*(Y,\mathbb{Z})$ are quasi-isomorphic.

This was proved by [Mandell](#Mandell) in 2003.



### In topological spaces


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (May recognition theorem)

A [[connected space]] of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]] with a non-degenerate basepoint that has the [[homotopy type]] of a $k$-fold [[loop space]] for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ admits the structure of an $E_\infty$-space.

### In simplicial sets


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem 


The [[model structure on algebras over an operad]] over [[E-∞ operad]]s in [[Top]] and in [[sSet]] are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]].

This is in [BergerMoerdijk I](#BergerMoerdijkHomotopy), [BergerMoerdijk II](#BergerMoerdijkAlgebras).


### In spectra

An $E_\infty$-algebra in [[spectra]] is an [[E-∞ ring]].



### In $\infty$-stacks

See [[Ek-Algebras]].

### In $(\infty,n)$-categories
