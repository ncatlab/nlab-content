## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[finite limits]]. A **[[coherent logic|coherent]] [[hyperdoctrine]]** over $C$ is a [[functor]]

$$
  P : C^{op} \to DistLattice
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of $C$ to the category of [[distributive lattices]], such that for every [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ in $C$, the functor $P(A) \to P(B)$ has a [[left adjoint]] $\exists_f$ satisfying

1. [[Frobenius reciprocity]];

1. [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

## Examples

### Powersets

The [[powerset]] functor

$$
  P : Set^{op} \to DistLattice
$$

(sending a [[set]] to its [[power set]] and a [[function]] to the [[preimage]]-assignment) is a coherent hyperdoctrine. 

### Over a coherent category

Let $C$ be a [[coherent category]]. For every [[object]] $A \in C$ the [[poset of subobjects]] $Sub_C(A)$ is a [[distributive lattice]]. 

The corresponding [[functor]]

$$
  C^{op} \to DistLattice
$$ 

from the [[opposite category]] of $C$ to the category of distributive lattices is called the **coherent hyperdoctrine** of $C$.
