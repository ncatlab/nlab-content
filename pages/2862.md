[[Bourbaki]] complained that in Arabic 'al' is an article so classical 'bi-' for two is incompatible with it. Thus Bourbaki and much of the French school makes it a point to say 'cogebra, bigebra' instead of 'coalgebra, bialgebra'. 

In modern [[algebra]], dealing with co-operations $A\to A^{\otimes n}$ instead of only with operations $A^{\otimes n}\to A$ for some monoidal product $\otimes$, is a specialty of a group of people who are often centered around the study of [[Hopf algebras]], but the subject is much wider including internal co(al)gebras, cogroups in cartesian categories, Tannaka reconstruction, PROPs (which have even operations taking $m$ arguments to $k$ arguments, hence generalizing both operations and co-operations), co-operads, bi(al)gebroids, Hopf algebroids, entwining structures, mixed [[distributive law]]s and so on. Common tools are graphical calculations (extending also to planar algebras and alike), [[Sweedler notation]] and so on.

We may call this area the theory of __gebras__ as in the article
