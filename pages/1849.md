The field content of standard 11-dimensional [[supergravity]] consists besides the gravitational field and the various fermionic superpartners of a field that is locally modeled by a differential 3-form. 

Given that 

* an ordinary [[connection on a bundle|connection]] form is often denoted by the symbol $A$;

* the local 2-form of the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] is usually denoted by the symbol $B$

this 3-form is usually denoted by the letter $C$ and just called "the $C$ field".

In complete analogy to how

* quantum particles couple to the [[electromagnetic field]];

* quantum [[string theory|strings]] couple ot the [[Kalb-Ramond field]];

do 2+1-dimensional extended objects , quantum "membranes", couple to the $C$-field. By the entirely same Dirac quantization argument described at [[electromagnetic field]] and [[Kalb-Ramond field]], this alone implies already that the $C$ field is a degree 3 [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne]] [[differential cohomology|differential cocycle]].

Moreover, a phenomenon closely related to the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] implies that the $C$-field is not an arbitrary degree 4 diffential cocycle, but the difference of two Chern-Simons differential cocycles, in that the curvature characteristic 4-form is constrained to be in the deRham cohomology class of the first Pontryagin characteristic class of the tangent bundle of the underlying space.
