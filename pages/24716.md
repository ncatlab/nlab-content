## Idea

While the inherently [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of [[quantum physics]] means, roughly, that as soon as there is more than one possibility, no [[quantum measurement]] outcome can be known with certainty; conversely this also means that all outcomes are possible with some probability. This converse statement had been stated by [Gell-Mann 1956](#GellMann56) for the case of [[quantum hadrodynamics]] (p. 859) in this form:

> "Principle of Compulsory Strong Interactions". Among baryons, antibaryons, and mesons, any process which is not forbidden by a conservation law actually does take place with appreciable probability. 

(See maybe also [Bunge 1976, 31](#Bunge76).)

For better or worse, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] on that same page found it helpful to add that:

> this is related to the state of affairs that is said to prevail in a perfect totalitarian state. Anything that is not compulsory is forbidden.

and some historians of science swallowed this red herring and ever since refer to Gell-Mann's "Principle of compulsion" in quantum physics instead as the "totalitarian principle" (eg. [Jaeger 2017](#Jaeger17), cf. [Kragh 2019a](#Kragh19a)). See also the "principle of plenitude" (cf. [Kragh 2019b](#Kragh19b)).
