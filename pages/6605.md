Yuri Berest is a professor at Cornell, mathematics department: [web](http://www.math.cornell.edu/People/Faculty/berest.html)

> My research interests include mathematical physics, algebraic geometry and representation theory. I am particularly interested in various interactions between these fields. Some of my recent work is related to noncommutative geometry, integrable systems, differential operators on algebraic varieties, representation theory of Cherednik algebras, and the theory of invariants of finite reflection groups.
