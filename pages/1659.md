## Idea

Let $S$ be any [[set]], and let $\mathbf{N}$ be the [[set]] of [[natural number]]s.  Let $|S|$ be the [[cardinality]] of $S$, and let $\aleph_0$ be the cardinality of $\mathbf{N}$.

Then $S$ is:
*  __denumerable__ if ${|S|} = \aleph_0$,
*  __countable__ if ${|S|} \leq \aleph_0$, and
*  __uncountable__ if ${|S|} \gt \aleph_0$.

Note that the first two terms are not entirely standardised; some authors use them interchangeably for one or the other concept.


## Definitions

If you accept the [[axiom of choice]], then there is really nothing more to say than what was above.  In weaker [[foundations]], more care may be needed.  The following seem to be the usual definitions in [[constructive mathematics]]:

*  $S$ is __denumerable__ if there exists a [[bijection]] from $\mathbf{N}$ to $S$.
*  $S$ is __countable__ if there exists a [[surjection]] from a [[decidable subset]] of $\mathbf{N}$ to $S$.
*  $S$ is __uncountable__ if, given any [[function]] $f$ from a decidable subset of $\mathbf{N}$ to $S$, the function is strongly non-surjective in the sense that there exists an element of $S$ that is not in the [[image]] of $f$.

Of course, the terms are even less standardised here.


## Properties

The [[empty set]] is countable; any uncountable set must be [[inhabited set|inhabited]].  Any (Kuratowski)-[[finite set]] is countable; any uncountable set must be [[infinite set|infinite]].  A denumerable set is precisely an infinite countable set; sometimes this is written as a _countably infinite set_.

Classically, a countable set is either [[finite set|finite]] or denumerable, although this need not hold constructively.  We do have, however, that a countable set is either empty or inhabited, which is classically trivial but need not hold constructively for every set.

Arguably, [[set theory]] as such begins with Georg Cantor\'s proof that the set of [[real number]]s is uncountable.  Given any infinite set, its [[power set]] is uncountable by [[Cantor's theorem]].

In some forms of constructive mathematics, especially in the Russian school, it is assumed (or provable from other assumptions) that *every* set is a [[subset]] of a countable set.  The fact the the set of real numbers is uncountable still applies, however, as the inclusion map of the subset need not [[split monomorphism|split]].  In particular, the set of [[computable number]]s is a subset of a countable set, but to prove that it is itself countable requires [[excluded middle]].
