## Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  a **Poisson $n$-algebra** $A$ is a [[Poisson algebra]] $A$ in a [[category of chain complexes]] with Poisson bracket of degree $(1-n)$ (which is a bracket of degree 0 on $\mathbf{B}^{n-1} A$). 


## Properties

### Relation to $E_n$-algebras

The [[homology]] of an [[algebra over an operad]] over the [[little cubes operad|little n-cubes operad]] for $n \geq 2$ is a Poisson $n$-algebra. 

Moreover, in [[chain complexes]] over a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0 the [[E-n operad]] is [[formal dg-algebra|formal]], hence equivalent to its homology, and so in this context $E_n$-algebras are equivalent to Poisson $n$-algebras.

### Relation to $L_\infty$-algebras
 {#RelationToLInfinityAlgebras}

There is a [[forgetful functor]] from Poisson $n$-algebras to [[dg-Lie algebras]] given by forgetting the [[associative algebra]] structure and by [[suspension of a chain complex|shifting]] the underlying chain complex by $(n-1)$.

Conversely, this functor has a [[derived functor|derived]] [[left adjoint]] which sends a [[dg-Lie algebra]] $(\mathfrak{g},d)$ to its _enveloping Poisson Lie $n$-algebra_ $(Sym(\mathfrak{g}[n-1], d))$. (See also [Gwilliam, section 4.5](#Gwilliam)).


## Examples

* A Poisson 1-algebra is a [[Poisson algebra]].

* A Poisson 2-algebra is a [[Gerstenhaber algebra]].

* The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] (see there for details) is naturally a Poisson $(1+n)$-algebra. 

* A [[classical BV complex]] is naturally (if obtained as a [[derived critical locus]], or else by definition) a Poisson 0-algebra.
