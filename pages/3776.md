**Shigeru Mukai** is a Japanese algebraic geometer. He discovered a first historical example of a nontrivial automorphism of the derived category of coherent sheaves on an abelian variety. Generlizations of this example are studied under the name of Fourier-Mukai transforms, or integral transforms of derived categories. 

Mukai's textbook (advanced undergraduate level) on moduli spaces has been translated from  Japanese to English and is one of the masterpieces of exposition in algebraic geometry, in accessible manner but with content to the point.
