## Idea

In the [[Lagrangian]] of a [[prequantum field theory]] the those terms that involve various [[field (physics)|fields]] describe the _coupling_ or _interaction_ of these fields with each other. Hence the prefactors of these terms encode the strength of this coupling, and hence are called _coupling constants_.

## Example

* [[Yukawa interaction|Yukawa coupling constant]]

## Related concepts
