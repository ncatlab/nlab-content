## Idea

The concept of _higher local field_ is the generalization of that of _[[local field]]_ to higher _[[dimension]]_. They are the subject of [[higher arithmetic geometry]].

In particular two-dimensional local field are the analog of [[loop spaces]] in [[arithmetic geometry]].

Their examples are $\mathbb{C}((t))$, $\mathbb{R}((t))$, $\mathbb{Q}_p((t))$, $\mathbb{F}_q((t))((u))$, etc. All these are naturally associated to a full flag of subschemes on algebraic and arithmetic surfaces.

These fields are not locally compact with respect to any reasonable topology on them.  But they are topologically self-dual, similar to the classical local fields. 
For a collection of articles on all the main aspects of higher local fields known by 2000, see ([Invitation to Higher Local Fields](#HLF00)). For a survey of higher local fields and associated algebraic theories see ([Morrow12](#Morrow12)).

One of the main new developments is the theory translation invariant measure and integration on higher local fields, a higher Haar measure, see ([Fesenko03](#Fesenko03)), ([Fesenko06](#Fesenko06)), ([Morrow10](#Morrow10)). This measure takes values not in $\mathbb{C}$ but in $\mathbb{C}((X))$. Fourier transform with respect to this rigorously defined measure has many features similar to those of the Feynman [[path integral]], the latter still does not have a rigorous math justification, see ([Fesenko 06, sect. 18](#Fesenko06)).
