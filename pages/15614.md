## Idea

The concept of _higher local field_ is the generalization of that of _[[local field]]_ to higher _[[dimension]]_. They are the subject of [[higher arithmetic geometry]].

In particular two-dimensional local field are the analog of [[loop spaces]] in [[arithmetic geometry]].

Their examples are $\mathbb{C}((t))$, $\mathbb{R}((t))$, $\mathbb{Q}_p((t))$, $\mathbb{F}_q((t))((u))$, etc. 

They are not locally compact with respect to any reasonable topology on them. But they are self-dual, similar to the classical local fields. And one can integrate on them - there is a higher Haar measure which takes values not in $\mathbb{C}$ but in $\mathbb{C}((X))$. Fourier transform with respect to this measure has many features similar to those of the Feynman [[path integral]] which still does not have rigorous math justification unlike this higher Haar measure, see ([Fesenko 06, sect. 18](#Fesenko06)).
