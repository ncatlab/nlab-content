## Idea

In [[algebraic geometry]], there is a __[[Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence]]__ and the statement of the sufficient conditions when it degenerates. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] has conjectured an extension of this to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] based on $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity category|categories]]. A somewhat weaker case, in the framework of [[dg-category|dg-categories]] has been proved by [[Dmitri Kaledin]]. Although the conjecture is in [[characteristic zero]], Kaledin has used a method in positive characteristic, combining the cyclic homology with ideas from the one of the proofs of the classical Hodge-dR ss degeneration with positive characteristic methods due [[Pierre Deligne]] and [[Luc Illusie]], involving Frobenius automorphism and so-called [[Cartier operator]]. This is one of the most nontrivial facts in [[noncommutative geometry]].
