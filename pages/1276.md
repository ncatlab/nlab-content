Given a [[ring]] (or $k$-algebra) $A$, a left $A$-[[module]] is __flat__ if tensoring with $A$ as a functor from left $A$-modules to left $A$-modules is [[exact functor]] (sends short exact sequences to short exact sequences). 

More explicitly, a left $A$-module $M$ is flat if and only if &ldquo;everything (that happens in $M$) happens for a reason (in $A$)&rdquo; --- that is, if whenever some identity $\sum_i a_i m_i = 0$ holds in $M$, we can write $m_i = \sum_j b_{i j} n_j$ for each $i$, with coefficients such that $\sum_i a_i b_{i j} = 0$ for each $j$.  This observation (Wraith, Blass) can be put into the more general context of modelling [[geometric theory|geometric theories]] by [[geometric morphism|geometric morphisms]] from their [[classifying topos|classifying toposes]], or equivalently, certain [[flat functor|flat functors]] from [[site|sites]] for such topoi.

In the case of an [[abelian category]], the notions of exact and flat functors coincide. The ring and/or the module above may be taken nonunital.
