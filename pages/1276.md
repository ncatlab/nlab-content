## Idea

A [[module]] over a [[ring]] $R$ is called _flat_ if its satisfies one of many equivalent conditions, the simplest to state of which is maybe: forming the [[tensor product of modules]] with $N$ preserves [[submodules]].

Under the dual geometric interpretation of [modules as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction) over the space on which $R$ is the ring of functions, flatness of a module is essentially the _local triviality_ of these bundles, hence in particular the fact that the [[fibers]] of these bundles do not change, up to isomorphism. See prop. \ref{ForFinitelyGeneratedFlatIsLocallyFree} below for the precise statement. On the other hand there is **no** relation to "flat" as in [[flat connection]] on such a bundle.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

We first state the definition and its equivalent reformulations over a [[commutative ring]] abstractly in _[In terms of exact functors and Tor-functors](#InTermsOfExactFunctorsAndTorFunctors)_. Then we give an explicit element-wise characterization in _[Explicitly in terms of identities](#InTermsOfIdentities)_. 

Much of this discussion also works in the more general case where the ring is not-necessarily taken to be commutative and not necessarily required to be equipped with a unit, this we indicate in _[For more general rings](#spring)_.

### In terms of exact functors and Tor-functors

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn #FlatModule}
###### Definition

An $R$-[[module]] $N$ is __flat__ if [[tensor product of modules|tensoring]] with $N$ over $R$ as a [[functor]] from $R$[[Mod]] to itself
$$
  (-)\otimes_R N : R Mod \to R Mod
$$

is an [[exact functor]] (sends [[short exact sequences]] to short exact sequences).

+-- {: .num_defn #FaithfullyFlatModule}
###### Definition

A module as above is _faithfully flat_ if it is flat and tensoring in addition _reflects exactness_, hence if the tensored sequence is exact if and only if the original sequence was.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #ImmediateReformulationOfFlatness}
###### Remark

The condition in def. \ref{FlatModule} has the following immediate equivalent reformulations:

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $(-)\otimes_R N$ is a [[left exact functor]],

   because tensoring with any module is generally already a [[right exact functor]];

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $(-)\otimes_R N$ sends [[monomorphisms]] ([[injections]]) to monomorphisms,

   because for a right exact functor to also be left exact the only remaining condition is that it preserves the monomorphisms on the left of a [[short exact sequence]];

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $(-)\otimes_R N$ is a [[flat functor]],

   because [[Mod]] is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]];

1. $N$ is flat precisely if the degree-1 [[Tor]]-[[functor]] $Tor_1^{R Mod}(-,N)$ is zero,

   because by the general properties of [[derived functors in homological algebra]], $L_1 F$ is the obstruction to a [[right exact functor]] $F$ being left exact;

1. $N$ is flat precisely if all higher [[Tor]] functors $Tor_{\geq 1}(R Mod)(-,N)$ are zero,

    because the higher [[derived functor in homological algebra|derived functors]] of an [[exact functor]] vanish;

1. $N$ is flat precisely if $N$ is an [[acyclic object]] with respect to the tensor product functor;

   because the [[Tor]] functor is symmetric in both arguments and an object is called tensor-[[acyclic object]] if all its positive-degree $Tor$-groups vanish.

=--

The condition in def. \ref{FlatModule} also has a number of not so immediate equivalent reformulations. These we discuss in detail below in _[Equivalent characterizations](#EquivalentCharacterizations)_. One of them gives an explicit characterization of flat modules in terms of relations beween their elements.  An exposition of this we give now in _[In terms of identities](#InTermsOfIdentities)_.



### Explicitly in terms of identities
 {#InTermsOfIdentities}

There is a characterisation of flatness that says that a left $A$-module $M$ is flat if and only if "everything (that happens in $M$) happens for a reason (in $A$)". We indicate now what this means. Below in prop. \ref{RelationsFromCharacterizationonIdealInclusion} it is shown how this is equivalent to def. \ref{FlatModule} above.

The meaning of this is akin to the existence of [[basis of a vector space|bases in vector spaces]].  In a [[vector space]], say $V$, if we have an identity of the form $\sum_i \alpha_i v_i = 0$ then we cannot necessarily assume that the $\alpha_i$ are all zero.  However, if we choose a basis then we can write each $v_i$ in terms of the basis elements, say $v_i = \sum_j \beta_{i j} u_j$, and substitute in to get $\sum_{i j} \alpha_i \beta_{i j} u_j = 0$.  Now as $\{u_j\}$ forms a basis, we can deduce from this that for each $j$, $\sum_i \alpha_i \beta_{i j} = 0$.  These last identities happen in the coefficient field, which is standing in place of $A$ in the analogy.

When translating this into the language of modules we cannot use bases so we have to be a little more relaxed.  The following statement is the right one.

Suppose there is some identity in $M$ of the form $\sum_i a_i m_i = 0$ with $m_i \in M$ and $a_i \in A$.  Then there is a family $\{n_j\}$ in $M$ such that every $m_i$ can be written in the form $m_i = \sum_j b_{i j} n_j$ and the coefficients $b_{i j}$ have the property that $\sum_i a_i b_{i j} = 0$.

The module $M$ being flat is equivalent to being able always to do this.

There is an alternative way to phrase this which is less element-centric.  The elements $m_i$ correspond to a [[morphism]] into $M$ from a [[free module]], say $m \colon F \to M$.  The $a_i$ correspond to a morphism $a \colon F \to F$, multiplying the $i$th term by $a_i$.  That we have the identity $\sum_i a_i m_i = 0$ says that the composition $m a$ is zero, or that $m \colon F \to M$ factors through the [[coequaliser]] of $a$ and $0$.  

Now we consider the elements $n_j$.  These define another morphism from a free module, say $n \colon E \to M$.  That the $m_i$ can be expressed in terms of the $n_j$ says that the morphism $m$ factors through $n$.  That is, there is a morphism $b \colon F \to M$ such that $m = n b$.  We therefore have two factorisations of $m$: one through $n$ and one through the [[cokernel]] $\coker a$.  The question is as to whether these have any relation to each other.  In particular, does $\coker a \to M$ factor through $n$?  We can represent all of this in the following diagram.

Saying that $M$ is flat says that this lift always occurs.

Taking this a step further, we consider the [[filtered category|filtered family]] of all finite [[subsets]] of $M$.  This generates a filtered family of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[free modules]] with compatible morphisms to $M$.  So there is a morphism from the [[colimit]] of this family to $M$.  This morphism is [[surjection|surjective]] by construction.  To show that it is [[injection|injective]], we need to show that any element in one of the terms in the family that dies by the time it reaches $M$ has actually died on the way.  This is precisely what the above characterisation of flatness is saying: the element corresponding to $\sum_i a_i m_i$ that dies in $M$ is already dead by the time it reaches $E$.

We have thus arrived at the following result: 

+-- {: .num_theorem #filtfree} 
###### Theorem 
A module is flat if and only if it is a [[filtered colimit]] of [[free modules]]. 
=-- 

This observation (Wraith, Blass) can be put into the more general context of modelling [[geometric theory|geometric theories]] by [[geometric morphism|geometric morphisms]] from their [[classifying topos|classifying toposes]], or equivalently, certain [[flat functor|flat functors]] from [[site|sites]] for such topoi.

### For more general rings

Even if the [[ring]] $R$ is not necessarily commutative and not necessarily unital, we can say: 

A left $R$-[[module]] is flat precisely if the [[tensor product of modules|tensoring]] functor

$$
  (-)\otimes_R \colon Mod_R \to Ab
$$

from _right_ $R$ modules to [[abelian groups]] is an [[exact functor]].

### Equivalent characterizations
 {#EquivalentCharacterizations}

By def. \ref{FlatModule}, or its immediate consequence, remark \ref{ImmediateReformulationOfFlatness}. $N \in R Mod$ is flat if for every injection $i \colon A \hookrightarrow$ also $i \otimes_R N \colon A \otimes_R N \to B \otimes_R N$ is an injection. The following proposition says that this may already be checked on just a very small subclass of injections.

+-- {: .num_theorem #CharacterizationOnIdealInclusions}
###### Theorem

An $R$-module $N$ is flat already if for all inclusions $I \hookrightarrow R$ of a [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[ideal]] into $R$, regarded as a module over itself, the induced morphism

$$  
  I \otimes_R N \to R \otimes_R N \simeq N
$$

is an injection.

###### Proposition

A module $N$ is flat precisely if for every finite linear combination of zero, $\sum_i r_i n_i  = 0\in N$ with $\{r_i \in R\}_i$,  $\{n_i \in N\}$ there are elements $\{\tilde n_j \in N\}_j$ and linear combinations

$$
  n_i = \sum_j b_{i j} \tilde n_j \;\;\in  N
$$

with $\{b_{i j} \in R\}_{i,j}$ such that for all $j$ we have

$$
  \sum_i r_i b_{i j}  = 0\;\;\; \in R
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A finite set $\{r_i \in R\}_i$ corresponds to the inclusion of a finitely generated ideal $I \hookrightarrow R$. 

By theorem \ref{CharacterizationOnIdealInclusions} $N$ is flat precisely if $I \otimes_R N \to N$ is an injection. This in turn is the case precisely if the only element of the tensor product $I \otimes_R R$ that is 0 in $R \otimes_R N = N$ is already 0 on $I \otimes_R N$.

Now by definition of [[tensor product of modules]] an element of $I \otimes_R N$ is of the form $\sum_i (r_i ,n_i)$ for some $\{n_i \in N\}$. Under the inclusion $I \otimes_R N \to N$ this maps to the actual linear combination $\sum_i r_i n_i$. This map is injective if whenever this linear combination is 0, already $\sum_i (r_i, n_i)$ is 0.

But the latter is the case precisely if this is equal to a combination $\sum_j (\tilde r_j  , \tilde n_j)$ where all the $\tilde r_j$ are 0. This implies the claim.

An $R$-module $N$ over a [[Noetherian ring]] $R$ is called a **locally free module** if there is a [[Zariski topology|cover]] by [[prime ideals]] $I \hookrightarrow R$ such that the [[localization of a module|localization]] $N_I$ is a [[free module]] over the [[localization of a ring|localization]] $R_I$.

###### Example

An [[abelian group]] is flat (regarded as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module) precisely if it is [[torsion subgroup|torsion-free]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the general discussion at [[derived functor in homological algebra]], the obstruction to $A \in Ab$ being flat are the first [[Tor]]-groups $Tor_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(-,A)$. By the discussion at  _[Tor -- relation to torsion subgroups](Tor#RelationToTorsionGroups)_ these a [[filtered colimits]] and [[direct sums]] of the [[torsion subgroups]] of $A$. In particular for $Tor_1^\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}_n,A)$ is the $n$-torsion subgroup of $A$. Hence $Tor_1^\mathbb{Z}(-,A)$ vanishes and hence $A$ is flat precisely if all torsion subgroups of $A$ are trivial.
