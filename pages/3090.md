## Definition

A **Serre fibration** is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological space]]s that has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions of the form $i : \Delta^n \hookrightarrow \Delta^n \times I$ that include the standard topological $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n \in $ [[Top]] as $\Delta^n \times \{0\}$.  

This condition is a special case of that for a [[Hurewicz fibration]].

The Serre fibrations serve as the abstract [[fibrations]] in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].
