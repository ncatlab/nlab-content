###### Definition

Write

$$
  J_{Top}
    \coloneqq

      D^n \stackrel{(id,\delta_0)}{\hookrightarrow} D^n \times I

+-- {: .num_defn #SerreFibration}
###### Definition


A **Serre fibration** is a $J_{Top}$-[[injective morphism]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, hence a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ that  has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions of the form $(id,0) \colon D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ that include the standard topological [[n-disk]] into its standard [[cylinder object]].

=--

I.e. $f$ is a Serre fibration if for every [[commuting square]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n  &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

then there exists a continuous function $h \colon D^n \to X$ such as to make a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n  &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,0)}}\downarrow 
    &{}^h\nearrow& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

###### Remark


The class of Serre fibrations serves as the class of abstract [[fibrations]] in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (whence "Serre-Quillen model structure").

###### Proposition

A Serre fibration has the right lifting property against all [[retracts]] of $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complexes]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The condition in def. \ref{SerreFibration} is part of the condition on a [[Hurewicz fibration]], hence every [[Hurewicz fibration]] is in particular a Serre fibration.

=--

The converse is false:

+-- {: .num_example #SerreFibrationsWhichAreNotHurewiczFibrations}
###### Example
**(Serre fibrations which are not Hurewicz fibrations)**

An example of a generalized [[covering space]] which is a Serre fibration but not a Hurewicz fibration is given by Jeremy Brazas [here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/241597/381).

=--

But under some regularity condition it does becomes true:

+-- {: .num_prop #SerreFibrationsBetweenCWComplexesAreHurewiczFibrations}
###### Proposition
**(Serre fibrations of [[CW-complexes]] are [[Hurewicz fibrations]])**

In the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces|compactly generated]] [[weakly Hausdorff topological spaces]]) a Serre fibration in which the total space and base space are both [[CW complexes]] is a [[Hurewicz fibration]].

(No relationship between the covering map and the CW structures is required.)  

=--

This is due to ([Steinberger-West 84](#SteinbergerWest84)) with the corrected proof due to ([Cauty 92](#Cauty92)) (pointers via [[Peter May]] [here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/241611/381)).


### Long exact sequences of homotopy groups

Since Serre fibrations are the abstract fibrations in the Serre-[[classical model structure on topological spaces]], the following statement follows from general [[model category]] theory. But it may also be seen by direct inspection, as follows.

+-- {: .num_lemma #CylinderOverCWComplexIsJTopRelativeCellComplex}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a finite [[CW-complex]], then its inclusion $X \overset{(id, \delta_0)}{\longrightarrow} X \times I$ into its standard [[cylinder object|cylinder]] is a $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First erect a cylinder over all 0-cells

$$ 
  \array{
     \underset{x \in X_0}{\coprod} D^0 &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
     \\
     \underset{x\in X_0}{\coprod} D^1 &\longrightarrow& Y_1
  }
  \,.
$$

Assume then that the cylinder over all $n$-cells of $X$ has been erected using attachment from $J_{Top}$. Then the union of any $(n+1)$-cell $\sigma$ of $X$ with the cylinder over its boundary is homeomorphic to $D^{n+1}$ and is like the cylinder over the cell "with end and interior removed". Hence via attaching along $D^{n+1} \to D^{n+1}\times I$ the cylinder over $\sigma$ is erected.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SerreFibrationGivesExactSequenceOfHomotopyGroups}
###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}, let $y \colon \ast \to Y$ be any point and write 

$$
  F_y \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

for the [[fiber]] inclusion over that point. Then for every choice $x \colon \ast \to X$ of lift of the point $y$ through $f$, the induced sequence of [[homotopy groups]]

$$

  \pi_{\bullet}(F_y, x)
    \overset{\iota_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X, x)
    \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(Y)
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]], in that the [[kernel]] of $f_\ast$ is canonically identified with the [[image]] of $\iota_\ast$: 

$$
  ker(f_\ast) \simeq im(\iota_\ast)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the image of $\iota_\ast$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$ (every sphere in $F_y\hookrightarrow X$ becomes constant on $y$, hence contractible, when sent forward to $Y$).

For the converse, let $[\alpha]\in \pi_{\bullet}(X,x)$ be represented by some $\alpha \colon S^{n-1} \to X$. Assume that $[\alpha]$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$. This means equivalently that $\alpha$ fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $\kappa$ is the contracting homotopy witnessing that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0$.

Now since $x$ is a lift of $y$, there exists a [[left homotopy]] 

$$
  \eta  \;\colon\; \kappa \Rightarrow const_y
$$ 

as follows:

$$
  \array{
    && S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    && D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,1)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
$$

(for instance: regard $D^n$ as embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is identified with the basepoint on the boundary of $D^n$ and set $\eta(\vec v,t) \coloneqq \kappa(t \vec v)$).

The [[pasting]] of the top two squares that have appeared this way is equivalent to the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,1)}}\downarrow 
    &&
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1} \times I 
      &\overset{(\iota_n, id)}{\longrightarrow}& 
    D^n \times I 
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Because $f$ is a [[Serre fibration]] and by lemma \ref{CylinderOverCWComplexIsJTopRelativeCellComplex} and prop. \ref{SerreFibrationHasRightLiftingAgainstJTopRelativeCellComplexes}, this has a [[lift]] 

$$
  \tilde \eta \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \times I \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$


Notice that $\tilde \eta$ is a basepoint preserving [[left homotopy]] from $\alpha = \tilde \eta|_1$ to some $\alpha' \coloneqq \tilde \eta|_0$. Being homotopic, they represent the same element of $\pi_{n-1}(X,x)$:

$$
  [\alpha'] = [\alpha]
  \,.
$$

But the new representative $\alpha'$ has the special property that its image in $Y$ is not just trivializable, but trivialized:
combining $\tilde \eta$ with the previous diagram shows that it sits in the following commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \alpha' \colon & S^{n-1} &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& S^{n-1}\times I &\overset{\tilde \eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\iota_n} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\iota_n,id)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    & D^n &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    & \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The commutativity of the outer square says that $f_\ast \alpha'$ is constant, hence that $\alpha'$ is entirely contained in the fiber $F_y$. Said more abstractly, the [[universal property]] of [[fibers]] gives that $\alpha'$ factors through $F_y\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X$, hence that $[\alpha'] = [\alpha]$ is in the image of $\iota_\ast$.
