## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #SerreFibration}
###### Definition


A **Serre fibration** is a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] that has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions of the form $(id,0) \colon D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ that include the standard topological [[n-disk]] into its standard [[cylinder object]].

=--

I.e. $f$ is a Serre fibration if for every [[commuting square]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n  &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

then there exists a continuous function $h \colon D^n \to X$ such as to make a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n  &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,0)}}\downarrow 
    &{}^h\nearrow& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

###### Remark

The condition in def. \ref{SerreFibration} is part of the condition on a [[Hurewicz fibration]], hence every [[Hurewicz fibration]] is in particular a Serre fibration.

###### Remark


The class of Serre fibrations serves as the class of abstract [[fibrations]] in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (whence "Serre-Quillen model structure").

+-- {: .num_prop #SerreFibrationGivesExactSequenceOfHomotopyGroups}
###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}, let $y \colon \ast \to Y$ be any point and write 

$$
  F_y \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

for the [[fiber]] inclusion over that point. Then for every choice $x \colon \ast \to X$ of lift of the point $y$ through $f$, the induced sequence of [[homotopy groups]]

$$

  \pi_{\bullet}(F_y, x)
    \overset{\iota_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X, x)
    \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(Y)
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]], in that the [[kernel]] of $f_\ast$ is canonically identified with the [[image]] of $\iota_\ast$: 

$$
  ker(f_\ast) \simeq im(\iota_\ast)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the image of $\iota_\ast$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$ (every sphere in $F_y\hookrightarrow X$ becomes constant on $y$, hence contractible, when sent forward to $Y$).

For the converse, let $[\alpha]\in \pi_{\bullet}(X,x)$ be represented by some $\alpha \colon S^{n-1} \to X$. Assume that $[\alpha]$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$. This means equivalently that $\alpha$ fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $\kappa$ is the contracting homotopy witnessing that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0$.

Now since $x$ is a lift of $y$, there exists a [[left homotopy]] 

$$
  \eta  \;\colon\; \kappa \Rightarrow const_y
$$ 

as follows:

$$
  \array{
    && S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    && D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,1)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
$$

(for instance: regard $D^n$ as embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is identified with the basepoint on the boundary of $D^n$ and set $\eta(\vec v,t) \coloneqq \kappa(t \vec v)$).

The [[pasting]] of the top two squares that have appeared this way is equivalent to the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,1)}}\downarrow 
    &&
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1} \times I 
      &\overset{(\iota_n, id)}{\longrightarrow}& 
    D^n \times I 
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Because $f$ is a [[Serre fibration]], this has a [[lift]] 
$$
  \tilde \eta \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \times I \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$
(Explicitly: consider the restriction of the horizontal maps to the upper and lower hemisphere $S_\pm^{n-1} \simeq D^{n-1}$ of $S^{n-1}$, respectively. Both these restricted diagrams have a lift by the immediate definition of Serre fibration, and both lifts glue along the equator and hence give a lift in the above diagram).

Notice that $\tilde \eta$ is a basepoint preserving [[left homotopy]] from $\alpha = \tilde \eta|_1$ to some $\alpha' \coloneqq \tilde \eta|_0$. Being homotopic, they represent the same element of $\pi_{n-1}(X,x)$:

$$
  [\alpha'] = [\alpha]
  \,.
$$

But the new representative $\alpha'$ has the special property that its image in $Y$ is not just trivializable, but trivialized:
combining $\tilde \eta$ with the previous diagram shows that it sits in the following commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \alpha' \colon & S^{n-1} &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& S^{n-1}\times I &\overset{\tilde \eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\iota_n} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\iota_n,id)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    & D^n &\overset{(id,0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    & \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The commutativity of the outer square says that $f_\ast \alpha'$ is constant, hence that $\alpha'$ is entirely contained in the fiber $F_y$. Said more abstractly, the [[universal property]] of [[fibers]] gives that $\alpha'$ factors through $F_y\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X$, hence that $[\alpha'] = [\alpha]$ is in the image of $\iota_\ast$.
