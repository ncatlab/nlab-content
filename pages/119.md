#The Idea 

A preorder is like a [[partial order]], but without the requirement that $x \le y$ and $y \le x$ implies $x = y$.  The reason is that if we think of a partially ordered set as a special sort of [[category]], it is [[evil]] to impose this equation between objects.  In a preorder, if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, we think of $x$ and $y$ as [[isomorphism|isomorphic]].

#Definition

A set equipped with a **preorder** is a [[category]] such that for any pair of objects $x, y$, there is at most one morphism from $x$ to $y$. In other words, it's a category [[enriched category theory|enriched]] over the category of [[truth value]]s.

People who call a partially ordered set a '[[poset]]' and a totally ordered set a '[[toset]]' may enjoy calling a preordered set a '[[proset]]'.  While nonstandard, this term is occasionally used here on the $n$Lab.

#Fact

Any preordered set is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to a [[poset]]. This is a special case of the theorem that every category has a [[skeleton]], but (if you define 'equivalence' properly) this case does _not_ require the [[axiom of choice]].

#Discussion

_[[Todd Trimble|Todd]] says:_ It's not clear to me how one avoids the axiom of choice. For example, any equivalence relation $E$ on a set $X$ defines a preorder whose posetal reflection is the quotient $X \to X/E$, and it seems to me you need to split that quotient to get the equivalence between the preorder and the poset.

_[[Toby Bartels|Toby]] says:_ In the absence of the axiom of choice, the correct definition of an equivalence of categories $C$ and $D$ is a span $C \leftarrow X \rightarrow D$ of full, faithful, essentially surjective functors. Or equivalently, a pair $C \leftrightarrow D$ of [[anafunctor]]s (with the usual natural transformations making them inverses).

_[[Todd Trimble|Todd]] says:_ Thanks, Toby. So if I understand you aright, the notion of equivalence you have in mind here is not the one used at the top of the entry [[equivalence]], but is more subtle. May I suggest amplifying a little on the above, to point readers to the intended definition, since this point could be confusing to those inexperienced in these matters? 

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: as indicated at [[anafunctor]] an equivalence in terms of anafunctors can be understood as a span representing an [[isomorphism]] in the [[homotopy category]] of $Cat$ induced by the [[folk model structure]] on $Cat$.

_Toby says_: I think that this should go on [[equivalence]], so I\'ll make sure that it\'s there. People that don\'t know what 'equivalence' means without choice should look there.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: It seems to me that any category $C$ gives rise to a preorder in a natural way, i.e.

$$a\to b\in Mor(C)\implies a\le b.$$

Is there a slick arrow theoretic way to say that? Something like, "There is a [[forgetful functor]] $F:Cat\to Ord$"?

I hope to write/read some arrow theoretic definition of a [[Hasse diagram]] too.

_Mathieu says_: It's rather the other way round: there is a “forgetful” 2-functor $Ord \to Cat$ (which forgets that the category is in fact an order (it's a full inclusion, so it forgets a property rather than a structure)), and the left adjoint to this 2-functor maps a category $C$ to the order with the same objects as $C$ and $a\leq b$ iff there exists an arrow $a\to b$.

_[[John Baez|John]] says_: You might try to define a Hasse diagram to be a [[directed graph]] whose [[quiver]] is a [[poset]].  In other words, you take a directed graph, consider the free category on that graph, and demand that this category be a poset.  

However, maybe it's a rule that a [[Hasse diagram]] with directed edges $x \to y$ and $y \to z$ is not allowed to have a directed edge $x \to z$.   If so, this is a further restriction on what directed graphs count as Hasse diagrams.
