## Idea 

A preorder (also sometimes called a _[[quasi-order]]_, especially if one works with $\lt$ instead of $\leq$) is like a [[partial order]], but without the "antisymmetry" requirement that $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ implies $x = y$.

By interpreting the relation $\leq$ as the existence of a unique arrow, preorders may be regarded as certain [[categories]] (namely, [[thin categories]]); see below for details.


## Definition

A **preorder** on a set $S$ is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] relation, generally written $\leq$.  A **preordered set**, or **proset**, is a set equipped with a preorder.  (This should not be confused with a [[pro-set]], i.e. a [[pro-object]] in [[Set]].)

Equivalently, a proset is a (strict) [[thin category]]: a [[strict category]] such that for any pair of objects $x, y$, there is at most one morphism from $x$ to $y$.  In other words, it's a (strict) [[category enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[truth values]].


## Properties

### Relation to partial orders

Any preordered set is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[partial order|poset]].  This is a special case of the theorem that every category has a [[skeleton]], but (if you define 'equivalence' weakly enough) this case does _not_ require the [[axiom of choice]].

### Relation to thin categories

In [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[foundations]], a preordered set is the same as a [[thin category]] (a category in which any two parallel [[morphisms]] are equal), and it is partially ordered just when it is [[skeletal category|skeletal]].  Thus, asking for a preordered set to be partially ordered may seem to break the [[principle of equivalence]] of [[category theory]].  However, as remarked above, a thin category always has a [[skeleton]] which is a poset; so working with posets up to isomorphism is the same as working with preordered sets up to equivalence.  In other words, if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, so that $x$ and $y$ are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], we may as well say that they are equal (since they are isomorphic in only one way).

Another way to say this is that the [[nerve]] [[simplicial set]] of a preorder, which is necessarily a _[[Segal space]]_ or _[[category object in an (infinity,1)-category]]_ in $Set \hookrightarrow \infty Grpd$, is in addition a _[[complete Segal space]]_ or _genuine category object_ in $Set$ if the preorder is in fact a partial order. For more on this perspective see at _[Segal space -- Examples -- In Set](Segal+space#InSetByNervesOfCategories)_.

If we distinguish between isomorphism and [[equality]] of elements in a preordered set (hence considering preordered sets up to isomorphism, rather than up to equivalence), then this is equivalent to considering the corresponding thin category to also be a [[strict category]].  When treated in this sense, preordered sets are not equivalent to posets.

On the other hand, in non-set-theoretic [[foundations]] where not every category need have an underlying set (i.e. need not be a [[strict category]] in any canonical way) --- such as [[homotopy type theory]] or [[preset]] theories --- a preordered set defined as "a set with a relation $\leq$ ..." is automatically a strict category, with a notion of equality of objects coming from the given set.  By contrast, in this case a thin category (as opposed to a more general category) does have a canonical structure of strict category in which equality of objects *means* isomorphism, but not every strict thin category is canonical in this sense.  In this case, partially ordered sets correspond to thin categories (with canonical strict-category structures), while preordered sets correspond to thin categories with arbitrary strict-category structures.

### Preorder reflection

The 2-category of preorders (more precisely, that of [[thin categories]]) is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in [[Cat]].  The reflector preserves the objects and declares $x \leq y$ if there exists an arrow from $x$ to $y$.
