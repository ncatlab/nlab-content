#Definition#

In a [[additive category]] [[category with translation|with translation]] $T : C \to C$ a **complex** is a [[differential object]]

$$
  d_X : X \to T X
$$

such that

$$
  X \stackrel{d_X}{\to} T X \stackrel{T d_X}{\to} T T X
$$

is the [[zero morphism]].

#Examples#

* A complex in the category $Gr(A)$ of [[graded object]]s in an additive category $C$ is called a [[chain complex]].

* For $d_X : X \to T X$ a complex, the shifted [[differential object]] $ d_{T X} : T X \stackrel{-T(d_X)}{\to}  T T X$ is again a complex.
