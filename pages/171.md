Brown and Golasinski gave a [[model category structure]] on the category of [[crossed complexes]] in

* [[Ronald Brown]] and [[Marek  Golasinski]], _A model structure for the homotopy theory of crossed complexes_, Cahiers de Topologie et G&#233;om&#233;trie Diff&#233;rentielle Cat&#233;goriques, 30 no. 1 (1989), p. 61-82 ([pdf](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CTGDC_1989__30_1_61_0))


The key facts used here are that the category of crossed complexes is monoidal closed, and that there is a good interval object, essentially the groupoid $\mathbf I$ extended to be a crossed complex. 


Notice that by other work of Brown and Higgins, crossed complexes are equivalent to [[strict omega-groupoid|strict globular omega-groupoids]], and also to strict cubical omega-groupoids with connections. In fact the monoidal closed structure on crossed complexes can be deduced from that on strict cubical omega-groupoids.
