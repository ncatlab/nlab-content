## Idea

Whatever it is otherwise, [[string theory]] turns out to be an organizational principle that subsumes a wealth of [[effective quantum field theories]] together with hints for their [[UV-completion]]. As such, string theory reveals a multitude of equivalences between superficially very different-looking (classes of) quantum field theories, or between various limits (notably strong/weak coupling limits) of various different-looking quantum field theories. Large classes of these equivalences go by the name of "dualities":

* **[[T-duality]]**, [[mirror symmetry]]

* **[[S-duality]]**, [[electric-magnetic duality]]

* **[[U-duality]]** .

Then there are the "string-string dualities", notably the 

* [[duality between F-theory and heterotic string theory]]

Then there are the 

There is also 

* the relation between [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and the various string theories, see

  * [[F-theory]]

* the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].
