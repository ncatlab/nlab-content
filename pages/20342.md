## Idea

_Twisted Cohomotopy_ is the [[twisted cohomology]]-variant of the
the [[non-abelian cohomology]]-[[generalized cohomology theory|theory]] _[[Cohomotopy]]_, [[representable functor|represented]] by [[homotopy types]] of [[n-spheres]].

The [[coefficients]]/[[twisted cohomology|twist]] for twisted Cohomotopy are [[spherical fibrations]], and [[cocycles]] are [[sections]] of these. For those [[spherical fibrations]] arising as [[unit sphere bundles]] of [[real vector bundles]] the twist may be understood as given by the [[J-homomorphism]].

Various classical theorem of [[differential topology]] are secretly theorems about twisted cohomotopy, including:

* [[Hopf degree theorem]]

* [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]]

* [Pontryagin-Thom theorem](cohomotopy#RelationToCobordismGroup)
