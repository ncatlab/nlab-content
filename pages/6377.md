A commutative unital ring $R$ is a __Dedekind ring__ if it is 

* Noetherian,
* [[integrally closed ring]],
* and every non-zero [[prime ideal]] in $R$ is maximal.

If $R$ is a Dedekind ring then every ideal can be uniquely factored into prime ideals and the non-zero [[fractional ideal]]s form a group under [[multiplication of ideal]]s.
