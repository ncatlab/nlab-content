## Idea 

In the context of [[quantum field theory]] an *effective action* is an object obtained from a more fundamental [[action functional]] by "averaging out" the dependency on certain variables.

There are two different notions of effective action

1. The _one-particle irreducible action_ ("1PI action");

1. The _Wilsonian effective action_ of [[effective quantum field theory]].
