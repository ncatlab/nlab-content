## Idea 

In the context of ([[perturbative QFT|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] an _effective action_ is an object obtained from a more fundamental ([[interaction]]) [[action functional]] by "averaging out" certain dependencies.

## Details

* For the plain effective action see at _[[S-matrix]]_ the section _[Effective action](S-matrix#EffectiveAction)_.

* More generally, for the _[[relative effective action]]_ see at _[[effective field theory]]_ the section _[Relative effective actions](effective+quantum+field+theory#RelativeEffectiveAction)_.

## Related concepts
