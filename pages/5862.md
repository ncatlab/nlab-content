## Idea

In the [[first order formulation of gravity]] the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] in [[dimension]] 3 happens to be equivalent to the [[action functional]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] for [[connection on a bundle|connections]] with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] ([[spin connection]] and [[vielbein]], for a suitable quadratic [[invariant polynomial]]. Similarly for 3-dimensional [[supergravity]]. See [[3d quantum gravity]].

Generally, for every higher degree ($n$-ary) [[invariant polynomial]] on the Poincar&eacute; Lie algebra there is the corresponding [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension $2n-1$. These Chern-Simons type [[action functional]]s all include the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] linear in the [[curvature]] as a summand, but generally contain higher degree curvature invariants. A theory of _Chern-Simons gravity_ is a field theory governed by such an [[action functional]].

While there is no experimental evidence for such higher curvature terms in the theory of [[gravity]], there exist parameter regions in which their predicted effects are smaller than could have been observed. Moreover, there are varous suggestions that under [[Inönü-Wigner contraction]] of the [[AdS Lie algebra]] to the [[Poincare Lie algebra]], and $so(n,2)$-Chern-Simons gravity theory could be close to an ordinary einstein-Hilbert theory. 

In view of this, the fact that Chern-Simons action functionals are singled out by their nice formal properties has led to various speculations that possibly the fundamental theory of gravity is secretly a theory of Chern-Simons gravity after all (see the [References](References)). Whether that is true or not, certainly in the general mathematical context of [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] the study of Chern-Simons gravity is natural and interesting.

**Warning** In parts of the literature the term _Chern-Simons grvaity_  is used for the modificaton of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] in  4-dimensions obtained by adding to the standard action the [[Pontryagin class]] term $\int_X \langle R \wedge R\rangle$ for $R$ the [[Riemann curvature]]. This is however not a Chern-Simons action functional in the strict sense of the term.
