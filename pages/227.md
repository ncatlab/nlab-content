A (unital, non-commutative) **ring** is (equivalently)

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Ab]].  
* a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] [[Ab]] with one object.
* a [[ringoid]] with one object.

Here $Ab$ is the category of [[abelian group|abelian groups]], made into a monoidal category using the tensor product of abelian groups.  A *commutative* (unital) ring is an [[abelian monoid]] object in [[Ab]].

[[Mike Shulman]]: I think this is a bit confusing.  I've never heard anyone talk about "a monoid enriched over" something.  A ring is a one-object *category* enriched over Ab, or a monoid in the monoidal category Ab.

Zoran: I agree wit Mike. Toby ?

_Toby_:  What could a monoid enriched over $C$ be other than a $1$-object (or pointed connected) category enriched over $C$?

Don't worry: these definitions equivalent to [the one you're used to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_mathematics#Definition).

In usual ring theory people often talk about nonunital rings as well: multiplicative [[semigroup]]s with additive [[abelian group]] structure where the multiplication is distributive toward addition.  As in the unital case, if the semigroup is abelian than the ring is said to be **commutative**.  One can define a semigroup object in any [[monoidal category]] simply by leaving off the unit condition of a monoid object; then a semigroup object in $Ab$ is a nonunital ring.  In order to talk about commutative semigroups, of course the monoidal category needs to be symmetric. To internalize $Ab$ to internal abelian group objects in a monoidal category it also needs to be symmetric. Thus one has a notion of a (unital or not) ring object in any symmetric monoidal category.

There is another generalization of rings: generalizing $k$-algebras to $A$-rings. Instead of a commutative unital ring $k$ (for algebras) take any (nonunital noncomutative) ring $A$. An $A$-ring $R$ is simply a monoid in the (nonsymmetric) monoidal category of $A$-bimodules. Every $A$-ring is a ring in the usual sense, in the sense that there is an obvious forgetful functor to the usual rings. In fact the unit map $A\to R$ is a morphism of rings, and the category of $A$-rings is precisely the [[coslice category]] $A/Ring$. Unfortunately, by the tradition, apart from being called $A$-rings, the objects (in Ring) *under* $A$ are usually called *rings over* $A$. Unlike for the $k$-algebras, the multiplication $R\times R\to R$ is not $A$-linear in the second factor, but only $\mathbb{Z}$-linear. 

A dual notion to an $A$-ring is an $A$-[[coring]].
