## Writings

Scharf pioneered the application of [[causal perturbation theory]] to the rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theories]]:

In his books

* _[[Finite Quantum Electrodynamics -- The Causal Approach]]_, Springer 1995

he discusses [[quantum electrodynamics]] this way, and in 

* _[[Quantum Gauge Theories -- A True Ghost Story]]_, Wiley 2001

he discusses [[Yang-Mills theory]], hence [[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[quantum gravity]] as [[perturbative quantum field theories]].
