## Idea

The _Siegel upper half space_ is the generalization of the [[upper half-plane]] as one passes from the description of complex [[elliptic curves]] to that of [[Riemann surfaces]] of higher [[genus]].

## Definition

The _Siegel upper half space of degree $g$ (or genus $g$)_ is the set of $g\times g$ [[symmetric matrices]] whose entries are complex numbers with positive-definite imaginary part.
