## Idea

In general, let $U = (U_i)_{i: I}$ and $V = (V_j)_{j: J}$ be two families of [[objects]] of some [[category]] $C$.  We say that $V$ is a __refinement__ of $U$ if there are a [[function]] $f: J \to I$ of indices and a [[morphism]] $V_j \to U_{f(j)}$ for each $j$.

A common special case is the concept of refinement of [[open covers]], example \ref{RefinementOfOpenCovers} below.

## Examples ##


We state a list of examples, beginning with general cases and then consecutively making them more specific.

###### Example


Very often we do this in the [[slice category]] $C/X$ for some object $X$.  If you spell this out, then you have families $(U_i \to X)_i$ and $(V_j \to X)_j$ of morphisms to $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a function $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram
\[ \label{slice}
  \array{ 
    V_j &&\to&& U_{f(j)}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
\]
for each $j$.

###### Example

More specifically, apply this to the poset of [[subobjects]] of $X$.  Then you have families $(U_i \hookrightarrow X)_i$ and $(V_j \hookrightarrow X)_j$ of subobjects of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a function $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram (eq:slice) for each $j$.

###### Example

Yet more specifically, apply this to the lattice of [[subsets]] of some set $X$.  Then you have families $(U_i \subseteq X)_i$ and $(V_j \subseteq X)_j$ of subsets of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there is a function $f: J \to I$ such that each $V_j$ is contained in $U_{f(j)}$.

Yet more specifically, let the families of subsets be indexed by themselves.  Then have collections $U \subseteq \mathcal{P}X$ and $V \subseteq \mathcal{P}X$ of subsets of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if for each $j$ there is an $i$ such that $V_j$ is contained in $U_i$.

Actually, this definition is slightly weaker than the previous one in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]].  Perhaps in that case the general definition should say that for each $j$ there is an $i$ and a morphism $V_j \to U_i$.

###### Example
**(refinement of [[open covers]])

Special cases of example \ref{RefinementOfSystemsOfSubsets} include refinement of [[filters]] and refinement of [[open covers]] of [[topological spaces]].


Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[open subsets]] which [[cover|covers]] $X$ in that $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i \;= \;X$.

Then a _refinement_ of this open cover is a set of open subsets $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ which is still an [[open cover]] in itself and such that for each $j \in J$ there exists an $i \in I$ with $V_j \subset U_i$.

=--

On the other hand, you might want to generalise the case of open covers to [[covers]] or covering [[sieves] on a [[site]].  In that case, the general definition still applies; you have covering families $(U_i \to X)_i$ and $(V_j \to X)_j$ of some object $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a map $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram (eq:slice) for each $j$.
