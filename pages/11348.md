## Idea

What is called _KO-dimension_ ([Connes 95](#Connes95)) is one notion of [[dimension]] which may be associated with a [[space]] that is given by a [[spectral triple]] with "real structure". 

The definition is motivated by the fact that the [[dimension]] $d$ of an ordinary [[closed manifold]] $X$ is seen in the grading shift involved in the [[Poincaré duality]] that the manifold induces on its [[ordinary homology]]/[[ordinary cohomology]]. Now since in [[spectral geometry]] ("[[noncommutative geometry]]") a [[space]] is represented by a [[spectral triple]] and hence by a kind of [[Dirac operator]] which naturally defines a class not in [[ordinary homology]] but in [[K-homology]], so the idea of KO-dimension is that it is the shift in the grading on [[K-theory]] which is involved in a [[Poincaré duality]] for [[spectral triples]].

Now since [[complex K-theory]] is 2-[[periodic cohomology theory|periodic]] this sees such a dimension only modulo 2, and hence only sees whether the dimension is even or odd. But [[KO]]-theory is 8-periodic and hence sees dimension at least modulo 8.

The exact definition of KO-dimension given in ([Connes 95, def. 3](#Connes95)) moreover requires that the [[Poincaré duality]] is exhibited by a class in [[KR-homology]].


## Examples

For classical [[Riemannian manifolds]] KO-dimension coincides with the traditional concept of [[dimension]] of manifolds, modulo 8.

The [[Podlés spheres]] have KO-dimension 2, but classical dimension 0.

The spectral [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] considered in ([Connes 06](#Connes06)) is taken to be along [[fibers]] with KO-dimension 6 and classical dimension 0.
