## Idea

A _curved dg-algebra_ is like a [[dg-algebra]], but instead of the [[differential]] squaring to 0, it squares to the graded commutator with a fixed element of the algebra: its "[[curvature]]". 

This is like the [[covariant derivative]] on the [[section]]s of a [[vector bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] satisfying $\nabla \circ \nabla = F_\nabla$, where $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] 2-form of the connection (valued, here, in fiber [[endomorphism]])s.

Curved dg-algebras appear in the description of various [[TQFT]]s.
