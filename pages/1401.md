Just as [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] go between [[functor|functors]], ananatural transformations go between [[anafunctor|anafunctors]].

Given two functors interpreted as anafunctors, the natural transformations and ananatural transformations between them are the same, so the term 'ananatural' is overkill; one only needs it to emphasise the ana-context and otherwise can just say 'natural'.  That is, a 'natural transformation' between anafunctors unambigously means an ananatural transformation.
