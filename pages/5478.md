## Idea

A *connected site* is a [[site]] satisfying sufficient conditions to make its [[topos of sheaves]] into a [[connected topos]].


## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[locally connected site]]; we say it is a **connected site** if it is also has a [[terminal object]]


## Properties

###### Proposition

If $C$ is connected site, then the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$ is a [[connected topos]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that $\Pi_0$ preserves the [[terminal object]].

The terminal object in the site [[representable functor|represents]] the terminal presheaf on $C$, which is the presheaf constant on the point. By the discussion at [[locally connected site]] we have that every constant presheaf is a [[sheaf]] over $C$, hence the terminal object of $Sh(C)$ is also represented by the terminal object in the site, and we just write "$*$" for all these terminal objects.

By the discussion there, the left adjoint $\Pi_0$ in the [[sheaf topos]] over a [[locally connected site]] is given by the [[colimit]] functor $\lim_\to : [C^{op}, Set]\to Set$. The colimit over a [[representable functor]] is always the point (this is the ([[co-Yoneda lemma|co]])-[[Yoneda lemma]] in slight disguise), hence indeed $\Pi_0 * = *$.

## Examples

* The [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ of a [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]] and [[connected topological space]] $Op(X)$ with the standard [[open cover]]-[[coverage]] is a connected site. The terminal object is $X$ itself.
