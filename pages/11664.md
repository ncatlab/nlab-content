## Idea

The analogy of [[F-theory]] but for [[KK-compactification]] not on an [[elliptic fibration]] to 10d [[type IIB superstring theory]] with its $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-[[S-duality]] but to [[7d supergravity]] with its $SL(5,\mathbb{Z})$ [[U-duality]] group.

This is referred to as "F'-theory" in ([Kumar-Vafa 96](#KumarVafa96)). For the moment see at _[[U-duality]]_ for more.
