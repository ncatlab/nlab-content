## Idea

A _rng_ (terminology due to [Jacobson](#Jacobson)) is a [[ring]] 'without [[identity]] element' (hence the missing 'i' in the name, get it?).  By the [[red herring principle]], we sometimes speak of a __nonunital ring__.  Note that classically, the word 'ring' originally meant a rng, but outside of traditional ring theory we more often require our rings to be unital (have identities).


## Definitions

Specifically:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


A __rng__ is a [[set]] $R$ with operations of addition and multiplication, such that:

*  $R$ is a [[semigroup]] under multiplication;
*  $R$ is an [[abelian group]] under addition;
*  multiplication distributes over addition.

=--

More sophisticatedly, we can say that, just as a ring is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A rng is a [[semigroup]] object in [[Ab]].

## Properties

### Unitization

+-- {: .num_defn #Unitisation}
###### Definition

Given a non-unital commutative ring $A$, then its _[[unitisation]]_ is the [[commutative ring]] $F(A)$ obtained by [[free construction|freely]] adjoining an [[identity]] element, hence the ring whose underlying [[abelian group]] is the [[direct sum]] $\mathbb{Z} \oplus A$ of $A$ with the [[integers]], and whose product operation is defined by

$$
  (n_1, a_1) (n_2, a_2) \coloneqq (n_1 n_2, n_1 a_2 + n_2 a_1 + a_1 a_2)
  \,,
$$

where for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a \in A$ we set $n a \coloneqq \underset{n\;summands}{\underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}}$.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the unitization $\mathbb{Z} \oplus A$ we have $(n,0) + (0,a) = (n,a)$ and hence it makes sense to abbreviate $(n,a)$ simply to $n+a$.  The product in the [[unitisation]] is then fixed by the defining requirement that $1 \cdot a = a$ and by the [[distributivity law]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Similar [[unitisation]] prescriptions work for non-commutative rings and for [[associative algebras]] over a fixed base ring, see also at

* _[[unitisation of C*-algebras]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Unitisation in def. \ref{Unitisation} extends to a [[functor]] from $CRng$ to [[CRing]] which is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[commutative rings]] to non-unital commutative rings.

$$
  F \colon CRng \leftrightarrow CRing \colon U
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is because the definition of any ring [[homomorphism]] out of $F(A)= (\mathbb{Z} \oplus A, \cdot)$ is uniquely fixed on the $\mathbb{Z}$-summand.

### Rngs as slices of rings
 {#AsSlicesOfRings}

+-- {: .num_defn #AugmentationIdealFunctor}
###### Definition


Write $CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}}$ for the [[slice category]] of [[CRing]] over the ring of [[integers]] ([[augmented algebra|augmented commutative rings]]). Write

$$
  CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}} \longrightarrow CRng
$$

for the [[functor]] to commutative non-unital rings which sends any $(R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z})$ to its _[[augmentation ideal]]_, hence to the [[kernel]] of $\phi$

$$
  (R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z}) \mapsto ker(\phi)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #AugmentationIdealFunctor}
###### Proposition

The [[augmentation ideal]]-functor in def. \ref{AugmentationIdealFunctor} is an [[equivalence of categories]] whose inverse is given by [[unitisation]], def. \ref{Unitisation}, remembering the [[projection]] $(\mathbb{Z} \oplus A) \to \mathbb{Z}$:

$$
  CRng \simeq CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the functor is [[fully faithful]] is to observe that for a ring $R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ the [[fiber]] $R_{n}$ over $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a [[torsor]] over the additive group underlying the [[augmentation ideal]] $A = R_0 = ker(\phi)$, and moreover it is a pointed torsor, the point being $n$ itself, hence is canonically equivalent to the [[augmentation ideal]] $A$, the equivalence being addition by $n$ in $R$. Hence any homomrphism of rings with identity over $\mathbb{Z}$

$$
  \array{
    R_1 && \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} && R_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi_2}}
    \\
    && \mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

is uniquely fixed by its restriction to the augmentation ideal $ker(\phi_1)$, whose image, moreover, has to be in the augmentation ideal $ker(\phi_2)$. 


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


In terms of [[arithmetic geometry]], the [[Isbell duality|formally dual]]  statement of prop. \ref{AugmentationIdealFunctor} is that arithmetic geometry induced by non-unital rings is equivalently ordinary arithmetic geometry _under_ [[Spec(Z)]].

### Terminology

The notation "rng" originates in

* {#Jacobson} Nathan Jacobson _Basic Algebra_,  

where the term is attributed to Louis Rowen.

([[Bourbaki|Bourbaki 6, chapter 1]]) uses the term "pseudo-ring" instead, which however has not caught on and even if more sane, will be understood less than "rng".
