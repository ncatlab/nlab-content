## Idea

A _rng_ (terminology due to [Jacobson](#Jacobson)) is a [[ring]] 'without identity' (hence the missing 'i' in the name, get it?).  By the [[red herring principle]], we sometimes speak of a __nonunital ring__.  Note that classically, the word 'ring' originally meant a rng, but we usually require our rings to have identities.

## Definition

### Explicit definition

Specifically, a __rng__ is a [[set]] $R$ with operations of addition and multiplication, such that
*  $R$ is a [[semigroup]] under multiplication;
*  $R$ is an [[abelian group]] under addition;
*  multiplication distributes over addition.


### Fancy definition

More sophisticatedly, we can say that, just as a ring is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so a rng is a [[semigroup]] object in $Ab$.

### Nonunital ring theory

A survey of commutative rng-theory is in

### Terminology

The notation "rng" originates in

* {#Jacobson} Nathan Jacobson _Basic Algebra_,  

where the term is attributed to Louis Rowen.

([[Bourbaki|Bourbaki 6, chapter 1]]) uses the term "pseudo-ring" instead, which however has not caught on and even if more sane, will be understood less than "rng".
