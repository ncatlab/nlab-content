## Idea

A rng is a [[ring]] 'without identity' (hence the missing 'i' in the name, get it?).  By the [[red herring principle]], we sometimes speak of a __nonunital ring__.  Note that classically, the word 'ring' originally meant a rng, but we usually require our rings to have identities.


## Explicit definition

Specifically, a __rng__ is a [[set]] $R$ with operations of addition and multiplication, such that
*  $R$ is a [[semigroup]] under multiplication;
*  $R$ is an [[abelian group]] under addition;
*  multiplication distributes over addition.


## Fancy definition

More sophisticatedly, we can say that, just as a ring is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so a rng is a [[semigroup]] object in $Ab$.
