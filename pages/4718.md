## Idea

The concept of _nonunital ring_ is like that of [[ring]] but without the requirement of the existence of an [[identity]] element ("unit" element). 

Historically, this was in fact the original meaning of "ring", and while mostly "ring" has come to mean by default the version with identity element, nonunital rings still play a role (see e.g. the review in [Anderson 06](#Anderson06)) and in some areas of mathematics "nonunital ring" is still the default meaning of "ring". In particular, non-unital rings may naturally be identified with the [[augmentation ideals]] of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[augmented algebra|augmented]] unital rings, see the discussion [below](#AsSlicesOfRings).
  
+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark on terminology

The term "non-unital ring" may be regarded as an example of the "[[red herring principle]]", as a non-unital ring is not a ring in the modern sense of the word. 

In [[Bourbaki|Bourbaki 6, chapter 1]] the term _pseudo-ring_ is used, but that convention has not become established.

Another terminology that has been suggested for "nonunital ring", and which is in use in part of the literature (e.g. [Anderson 06](#Anderson06)) is "rng", where dropping the "i" in "ring" is meant to be alluding to the absence of _i_dentity elements. This terminology appears in print first in ([Jacobson](#Jacobson)), where it is attributed to Louis Rowen. Similarly there is, for whatever it's worth, the suggestion that a ring without negatives, hence a [[semiring]], should be called a _[[rig]]_.

## Definitions

Specifically:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


A __nonunital ring__ or _rng_ is a [[set]] $R$ with operations of addition and multiplication, such that:

*  $R$ is a [[semigroup]] under multiplication;
*  $R$ is an [[abelian group]] under addition;
*  multiplication distributes over addition.

=--

More sophisticatedly, we can say that, just as a ring is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _nonuntial ring_ or _rng_ is a [[semigroup]] object in [[Ab]].

## Properties

### Unitization

+-- {: .num_defn #Unitisation}
###### Definition

Given a non-unital commutative ring $A$, then its _[[unitisation]]_ is the [[commutative ring]] $F(A)$ obtained by [[free construction|freely]] adjoining an [[identity]] element, hence the ring whose underlying [[abelian group]] is the [[direct sum]] $\mathbb{Z} \oplus A$ of $A$ with the [[integers]], and whose product operation is defined by

$$
  (n_1, a_1) (n_2, a_2) \coloneqq (n_1 n_2, n_1 a_2 + n_2 a_1 + a_1 a_2)
  \,,
$$

where for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a \in A$ we set $n a \coloneqq \underset{n\;summands}{\underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}}$.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the unitization $\mathbb{Z} \oplus A$ we have $(n,0) + (0,a) = (n,a)$ and hence it makes sense to abbreviate $(n,a)$ simply to $n+a$.  The product in the [[unitisation]] is then fixed by the defining requirement that $1 \cdot a = a$ and by the [[distributivity law]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Similar [[unitisation]] prescriptions work for non-commutative rings and for [[nonunital algebras]] over a fixed base ring, see also at

* _[[unitisation of C*-algebras]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Unitisation in def. \ref{Unitisation} extends to a [[functor]] from $CRng$ to [[CRing]] which is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[commutative rings]] to non-unital commutative rings.

$$
  F \colon CRng \leftrightarrow CRing \colon U
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is because the definition of any ring [[homomorphism]] out of $F(A)= (\mathbb{Z} \oplus A, \cdot)$ is uniquely fixed on the $\mathbb{Z}$-summand.

### Nonuntial rings as slices of rings
 {#AsSlicesOfRings}

+-- {: .num_defn #AugmentationIdealFunctor}
###### Definition


Write $CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}}$ for the [[slice category]] of [[CRing]] over the ring of [[integers]] ([[augmented algebra|augmented commutative rings]]). Write

$$
  CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}} \longrightarrow CRng
$$

for the [[functor]] to commutative non-unital rings which sends any $(R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z})$ to its _[[augmentation ideal]]_, hence to the [[kernel]] of $\phi$

$$
  (R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z}) \mapsto ker(\phi)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #AugmentationIdealFunctor}
###### Proposition

The [[augmentation ideal]]-functor in def. \ref{AugmentationIdealFunctor} is an [[equivalence of categories]] whose inverse is given by [[unitisation]], def. \ref{Unitisation}, remembering the [[projection]] $(\mathbb{Z} \oplus A) \to \mathbb{Z}$:

$$
  CRng \simeq CRing_{/\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the functor is [[fully faithful]] is to observe that for a ring $R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ the [[fiber]] $R_{n}$ over $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a [[torsor]] over the additive group underlying the [[augmentation ideal]] $A = R_0 = ker(\phi)$, and moreover it is a pointed torsor, the point being $n$ itself, hence is canonically equivalent to the [[augmentation ideal]] $A$, the equivalence being addition by $n$ in $R$. Hence any homomrphism of rings with identity over $\mathbb{Z}$

$$
  \array{
    R_1 && \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} && R_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi_2}}
    \\
    && \mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

is uniquely fixed by its restriction to the augmentation ideal $ker(\phi_1)$, whose image, moreover, has to be in the augmentation ideal $ker(\phi_2)$. 


=--

The identification of non-unital algebras as augmentation ideals of augmented unital algebras is used for instance in ([Fresse 06](#Fresse06)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of [[arithmetic geometry]], the [[Isbell duality|formally dual]]  statement of prop. \ref{AugmentationIdealFunctor} is that arithmetic geometry induced by non-unital rings is equivalently ordinary arithmetic geometry _under_ [[Spec(Z)]].

### Terminology

The notation "rng" originates in

* {#Jacobson} Nathan Jacobson _Basic Algebra_,  

where the term is attributed to Louis Rowen.

([[Bourbaki|Bourbaki 6, chapter 1]]) uses the term "pseudo-ring" instead, which however has not caught on and even if more sane, will be understood less than "rng".
