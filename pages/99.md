## Idea

In as far as a [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of an $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] is the algebra of functions on an [[NQ-supermanifold]] $\mathbf{X}$, the **Weil algebra** is the algebra of functions on the [[shifted tangent bundle]] $T[1] \mathbf{X}$.

Over a contractible base space the Weil algebra may also be understood as the [[mapping cone]] of the identity on the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]].

One can also understand this as generalizing the notion of [[superdifferential form]] from ordinary [[supermanifold]]s to [[NQ-supermanifolds]].


## Definition

For $CE(\mathfrak{g}) = \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X_0)} \mathfrak{g}^*$ the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] $g$ over a [[manifold]] $X_0$, the corresponding **Weil algebra** is

$$
  \mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{g})
  :=
  \left(
    \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X_0)}
    (
      \mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \Gamma(T^* X_0) 
      \otimes \mathfrak{g}^*[1]
    )
    , d_{\mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{g})}
  \right)
$$

where the differential acts as the deRham differential on $\wedge^\bullet \Gamma(T^* X)$ and is defined on generators in $\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ by 
$$
  d_{\mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{g})}
  =
  \left(
    \array{
       d_{\mathrm{CE}(\mathfrak{g})}
       &
       0
       \\
       \sigma
       &
       - \sigma \circ d_{\mathrm{CE}(\mathfrak{g})}
       \circ \sigma^{-1}
    }
    \,,
  \right)
$$
where $\sigma|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ is the canonical degree-shifting isomorphism.

## Examples

### Weil algebra of a Lie algebra {#WeilofLieAlg}

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite dimensional [[Lie algebra]]. This Lie algebra regarded as a [[Lie algebroid]] has as base manifold the point, $X_0 = pt$. Its algebra of functions is accordingly the ground field, and the algebra $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X_0)} \mathfrak{g}^*$ is just a [[Grassmann algebra]].

The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d_{\mathfrak{g}})
  \,,
$$

where the differential acts on the elements of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree 1 by the linear dual of the Lie bracket.

$$
  d \mathfrak{g}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} = [-,-]^* : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^* \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*
  \,.
$$

The corresponding Weil algebra is obtained by adding another copy of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree 2

$$
  W(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1]), d_{W(\mathfrak{g})})
$$

where with $\sigma : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ the degree shift isomorphism, the differential acts as

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*}
  : 
  [-,-]^* + \sigma
$$

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*[1]}
  : 
  \sigma \circ d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} \circ \sigma^{-1}
  \,.
$$

For illustration, we spell this out in a basis.

Let $\{t_a\}_a$ be a basis for the underlying vector space of $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ be the corresponding structure constants of the Lie bracket

$$
  [t_b, t_c] = C^a{}_{b c} t_a 
  \,.
$$

Then the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra is generated on generators $\{t^a\}$ of degree 1, on which the differential acts as

$$
  d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} : t^a \mapsto - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
  \,.
$$

The Weil algebra in turn is generated from these generators $\{t^a\}$ in degree 1 and generators $\{r^a\}$ in degree 2, with differential given by

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} : t^a \mapsto - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c + r^a
$$

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} : r^a \mapsto C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge r^c 
  \,.
$$

The use of the Weil algebra in the calculation of the equivariant deRham cohomology of manifolds acted on by a compact group goes at least back to two papers by H. Cartan from 1950. These papers are reprinted, explained and put in a modern context in the book

## Discussion

A previous version of this entry led to this discussion:

+-- {: .query}
Warning: the X in the Idea section is not the X in this definition. I suggest calling it M and saying that M is the manifold with algebra of functions the degree zero part of $CE(\mathfrak{g})$.  ---Maarten

What if anything is the relationship between the $\mathbf{X}$ above and the $X$ (or $M$) here?  (Sorry, I don\'t know anything about this stuff.)  ---Toby

$CE(\mathfrak{g})$ is the graded supercommutative ring of functions on the NQ-supermanifold X and M is ordinary manifold with functions the degree 0 part of $CE(\mathfrak{g})$. X maps to M, but is much bigger. ---Maarten

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I renamed now the $X$ in the definition into an $X_0$ and said explicitly that this is the underlying manifold.

That looks much better, thanks. Should we delete the discussion, or how does that work?
---Maarten

Yes, when a discussion is closed and does not contain material that is of interest independently for posteriority, we should eventually remove it. As soon as you see this here, feel free to delete the box. -- [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]
