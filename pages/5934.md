## Definition

A [[smooth function]] $f : X \to Y$ between two [[smooth manifold]]s is a **local diffeomorphism** if the following equivalent conditions hold

* $f$ is both a [[submersion]] and an [[immersion]];

* for each point $x \in X$ the [[derivative]] $d f : T_x X \to T_{f(x)} Y$ is an [[isomorphism]] of [[tangent space|tangent]] [[vector space]]s;

* for each point $x \in X$ there exists an [[open subset]] $x \in U \subset X$ such that

  1. the [[image]] $f(U)$ is an [[open subset]] in $Y$;

  1. $f$ restricted to $U$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] onto its image

     $$
       f|_U : U \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  f(U)
     $$

The equivalence of the conditions on [[tangent space]] with the conditions on [[open subset]]s follows by the [[inverse function theorem]].

## Properties

### General

* A local diffeomorphism is a [[local homeomorphism]] and so also an [[open map]].

### Abstract characterization

The [[category]] [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifold]]s may naturally be thought of as sitting inside the more general context of the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s. This is canonically equipped with a notion of [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal cohesion]] exhibited by its inclusion into [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]]. This implies that there is an intrinsic notion of [[formally étale morphism]]s of smooth $\infty$-groupoids in general and of smooth manifolds in particular

###### Proposition

A [[smooth function]] is a [[formally étale morphism]] in this sense precisely if it is a local diffeomorphism.
