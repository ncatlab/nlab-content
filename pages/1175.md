## Definition

A **von Neumann algebra** is a unital [[*-algebra|*-subalgebra]] of the algebra of [[bounded operator]]s on a complex [[Hilbert space]], which is closed in [[weak operator topology]]. 

Clearly, they are automatically closed in norm topology, hence they form a (particularly nice) class of $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebras]].

### Relevance

The [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem|Gel’fand–Naimark theorem]] states that there is a contravariant [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the [[category]] of commutative von Neumann algebras and the category of localizable [[measurable space|measurable spaces]]; that is, the [[opposite category]] of one is equivalent to the other. See [Relation to Measurable Spaces](#RelationToMeasureSpaces) below. General von Neumann algebras are seen then as a 'noncommutative' measurable spaces in a sense analogous to [[noncommutative geometry]].

The importance of von Neumann algebras for ([[higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and topology lays in the evidence that von Neumann algebras are deeply connected with the low dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (2d [[CFT]], [[TQFT]] in low dimensions, inclusions of [[von Neumann algebra factor|factor]]s, [[quantum group]]s and [[knot theory]]; [[elliptic cohomology]]: works of Wenzl, Vaughan Jones, Anthony Wasserman, Kerler, Kawahigashi, Ocneanu, Szlachanyi etc.). 

The highlights of their structure theory include the results on classification of [[von Neumann algebra factor|factors]] ([[Alain Connes]], 1970s) and theory of inclusions of subfactors (V. Jones). (Hilbert) [[bimodule]]s over von Neumann algebras have a remarkable tensor product due Connes ([[Connes fusion]]). Following Segal's manifesto

### General

The _[[bicommutant theorem]]_ (as known as the _double commutant theorem_ , or _von Neumann's double commutant theorem_ ) is the following result. 

Let $A \subseteq B(H)$ be a sub-[[star-algebra]] of the [[C-star algebra]] of [[bounded linear operator|bounded linear operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$. Then $A$ is a [[von Neumann algebra]] on $H$ if and only if $A = A''$, where $A'$ denotes the [[commutant]] of $A$. 

Notice that the condition of $A$ being a von Neumann algebra (being closed in the [[weak operator topology]]; "weak" here can be replaced by "strong", "ultrastrong", or "ultraweak" as described in [[operator topology]]), which is a [[topology|topological]] condition, is by this result equivalent to an algebraic condition (being equal to its bicommutant).  

### Relation to measure spaces
 {#RelationToMeasureSpaces}

The [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem|Gel’fand–Naimark theorem]] states that the category of [[localizable measurable spaces]] is contravariantly [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to (that is equivalent to the [[opposite category|opposite]] of) the category of commutative von Neumann algebras.  As such, arbitrary von Neumann algebras may be interpreted as 'noncommutative' measurable spaces in a sense analogous to [[noncommutative geometry]].


## Topics of interest for the understanding of AQFT

This paragraph will collect some facts of interest for the aspects of [[AQFT]].

In this paragraph $\mathcal{M}$ will always be a von Neumann algebra acting on a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ with [[commutant]] $\mathcal{M}'$.

### Vectors

###### Definition

A [[vector]] $x \in \mathcal{H}$ is a **[[cyclic vector]]** if $\mathcal{M}x$ is dense in $\mathcal{H}$.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A [[vector]] $x \in \mathcal{H}$ is a **[[separating vector]]** if $M(x) = 0$ implies $M = 0$ for all $M \in \mathcal{M}$.

###### Theorem

The notions of cyclic and separating are dual with respect to the commutant, that is a vector is cyclic for $\mathcal{M}$ iff it is separating for $\mathcal{M}'$.

### Projections in von Neumann algebras

One crucial feature of von Neumann algebras is that they contain 
"every projection one could wish for": there are three points that make this statement precise:

* the linear combinations of projections are norm dense in a von Neumann algebra

* [[Gleason's theorem]]

* Murray--von Neumann classification of [[von Neumann algebra factor|factors]] 

#### Projections are norm dense

First let us note that every element $A$ of a von Neumann algebra can trivially be written as a linear combination of two selfadjoint elements:
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} (A + A^*) + i\frac{1}{2i} (A - A^*)
$$

Then, by the [[spectral theorem]] every selfadjoint element A is represented by it's spectral measure E via
$$
A = \integral_{-\|A\|}^{\|A\|} \lambda E(d\lambda)
$$
The integral converges in norm to A and all spectral projections are elements of the von Neumann algebra. It immediatly follows that the set of finite sums of multiples of projections is norm dense in every von Neumann algebra.

## Remarks

* Von Neumann algebras may also be defined abstractly as (abstract) $C^*$-algebras with a predual.

* Von Neumann algebras are also sometimes called $W^*$-algebras; they should not be confused with $W$-algebras in (logarithmic) conformal field theory.

* Combining the previous two remarks, some authors use ‘$W^*$-algebra' for the abstract concept and 'von Neumann algebra' for the concrete concept.  Equivalently, then, a von Neumann algebra is a $W^*$-algebra equipped with a free action on a Hilbert space (and it\'s a theorem that any $W^*$-algebra may be so equipped).
