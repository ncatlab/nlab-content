## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **sober** if its [[point]]s are exactly determined by its open-set [[lattice]].  Different equivalent ways to say this are:

* $X$ is [[isomorphic]] to the space of points of the [[locale]] it gives rise to (see there for details).

* The points of $X$ are in bijection with the _completely prime [[filter]]s_ of its open-set lattice.

* (Assuming classical logic) $X$ is $T_0$ and every [[irreducible closed set]] (non-empty closed set that is not the union of any two non-empty closed sets) is the closure of a point.


## Properties

* Sobriety is a separation property that is stronger than $T_0$, but incomparable with $T_1$.  With [[classical logic]], every [[Hausdorff space]] is sober, but this can fail [[constructive mathematics|constructively]].

* The [[category]] of sober spaces is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in the category of all topological spaces; the [[left adjoint] is called the **soberification**.  This reflection is also induced by the [[idempotent adjunction]] between spaces and [[locales]]; thus sober spaces are precisely those spaces that are the space of points of some locale, and the [[category]] of sober spaces is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[locales with enough points]].


## Examples (and non-examples)


* Any nontrivial [[indiscrete space]] is not sober, since it is not $T_0$. More interestingly, the space $R^2$ with the [[Zariski topology]] is $T_1$ but not sober, since every subvariety is an irreducible closed set which is not the closure of a point.  Its _soberification_ is, unsurprisingly, the [[scheme]] $Spec(R[x,y])$, which contains "generic points" whose closures are the subvarieties.

* The [[Alexandroff topology]] on a [[poset]] is also not, in general, sober.  For instance, if $P$ is the infinite binary tree (the set of finite $\{0,1\}$-words with the "extends" preorder), then the soberification of its Alexandroff topology is [[Wilson space]], the space of finite or infinite $\{0,1\}$-words.
