## Idea 

If $\mathcal{O}(X)$ is the topology on a [[topological space]] $X$ (i.e. its [[frame of opens]]), and if a map $\mathcal{O}(X) \to \mathcal{O}(1)$ that preserves finite [[meets]] and arbitrary [[joins]] (a [[homomorphism]] of [[frames]]) is considered an instance of "seeing a point $1 \to X$", then $X$ is _sober_ precisely if every point we see is really there (i.e., is induced from a [[continuous function] $1 \to X$), and if we never see double. 

The condition that a [[topological space]] be _sober_ is an extra condition akin to a [[separation axiom]]. In fact with [[classical logic]] it is a condition implied by the $T_2$ [[separation axiom]] ([[Hausdorff implies sober]]) and implying $T_0$.

| [[separation axioms]]                 |
|---------------------------------------|
| $\array{\\ &&& T_2 = \text{Hausdorff}  \\ && \swArrow && \seArrow \\ \, & T_1 && && \text{sober} & \, \\ && \seArrow && \swArrow \\ &&& T_0 = \text{Kolmogorov} \\ }  $ |

But the soberity condition on a topological space has deeper meaning. It means that [[continuous functions]] betwen sober topolgical spaces are entirely determined by their [[inverse image]] functions on the [[frames of opens]], disregarding the underlying sets of points. Technically this means that the sober topological spaces are precisely the [[locales]] among the topological spaces.

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **sober** if its [[points]] are exactly determined by its [[lattice of open subsets]].  Different equivalent ways to say this are:

* The [[continuous map]] from $X$ to the space of points of the [[locale]] that it gives rise to (see there for details) is a [[homeomorphism]].

* The [[function]] from points of $X$ to the _completely prime [[filters]]_ of its open-set lattice is a [[bijection]].

* (Assuming classical logic) every [[irreducible closed set]] (non-empty closed set that is not the [[union]] of any two proper closed subsets) is the [[topological closure|closure]] of a point.

In each case, half of the definition is that $X$ is [[T0]], the other half states that $X$ has __enough points__:

###### Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ has _enough points_ if the following equivalent conditions hold:

* The [[continuous map]] from $X$ to the space of points of the [[locale]] that it gives rise to (see there for details) is a [[quotient space|quotient map]].

* The [[function]] from points of $X$ to the _completely prime [[filters]]_ of its [[lattice of open subsets|open-set lattice]] is a [[surjection]].

* (Assuming classical logic) every [[irreducible closed set]] (non-empty closed set that is not the [[union]] of any two proper closed subsets) is the [[topological closure|closure]] of a point.

## Properties

### Separation

* Sobriety is a [[separation property]] that is stronger than [[T0]], but incomparable with [[T1]].  With [[classical logic]], every [[Hausdorff space]] is sober (see at _[[Hausdorff implies sober]]_), but this can fail [[constructive mathematics|constructively]].

$$
  Hausdorff = T_2 \Rightarrow sober \Rightarrow T_0
$$

### As locales with enough points
 {#AsLocalesWithEnoughPoints}

What makes the concept of sober topological spaces special is that
for them the concept of [[continuous functions]] may be expressed entirely in terms
of the relations between their [[open subsets]], disregarding the underlying set of points of which these open are in fact subsets. 
In order to express this
property, we first introduce the following terminology:

+-- {: .num_defn #HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}
###### Definition

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[topological spaces]].
Then a function

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; \phi
$$

between their [[frame of opens|sets of open subsets]] is called a _[[frame]] [[homomorphism]]_
if it preserves

1. arbitrary [[unions]];

1. [[finite number|finite]] [[intersections]].

In other words, $\phi$ is a frame homomorphism if

1. for every [[set]] $I$ and every $I$-indexed set $\{U_i \in \tau_Y\}_{i \in I}$ of elements of $\tau_Y$, then

   $$
     \phi\left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i\right) \;=\; \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \phi(U_i)\;\;\;\;\in \tau_X
     \,,
   $$

1. for every [[finite set]] $J$ and every $J$-indexed set $\{U_j \in \tau_Y\}$ of elements in $\tau_Y$, then

   $$
     \phi\left(\underset{j \in J}{\cap} U_j\right)
       \;=\;
     \underset{j \in J}{\cap} \phi(U_j)
     \;\;\;\;\in \tau_X
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #PreservationOfInclusionsByFrameHomomorphism}
###### Remark

A [[frame]] [[homomorphism]] $\phi$ as in def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}
necessarily also preserves inclusions in that 

* for every inclusion $U_1 \subset U_2$ with $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_Y \subset P(Y)$ then

  $$
    \phi(U_1) \subset \phi(U_2) \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \in \tau_X
    \,.
  $$
  
This is because inclusions are witnessed by unions

$$
  (U_1 \subset U_2)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left( U_1 \cup U_2 = U_2 \right)
$$

and by finite intersections:

$$
  (U_1 \subset U_2)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    U_1 \cap U_2 = U_1
  \right)
  \,.
$$

###### Example

For

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X,\tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

a [[continuous function]], then its function of [[pre-images]]

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; f^{-1}
$$

is a frame homomorphism according to def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}.

=--

For sober topological spaces the converse holds:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ are [[sober topological spaces]], then
for every frame homomorphism (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; \phi
$$

there is a unique [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that $\phi$ is the function 
of forming [[pre-images]] under $f$:

$$
  \phi = f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

=--

Stated more abstractly this says that sober topological spaces are [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the [[locales with enough points]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\ast = (\{x\}, \tau_\ast = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\})$ be the [[point]] [[topological space]].

We first consider the special case of frame homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X \;\colon\; \phi_\ast
$$

and show that these are in bijection to the underlying set $X$, identified with the continuous functions
$\ast \to (X,\tau)$.


To this end, consider the [[union]] $U_{\emptyset}$ of all elements $U \in \tau_x$ such that $\phi_\ast(U) = \emptyset$:

$$
  U_{\emptyset}
    \coloneqq
  \underset{{U \in \tau_X} \atop {\phi_\ast(U) = \emptyset} }{\cup} 
   U
  \,.
$$

Then observe that: 


$(\ast)$ _If there are two elements $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_X$ with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}$
then $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}$._

This is because

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi_\ast(U_1 \cap U_2) 
    & = 
    \phi_\ast(U_1) \cap \phi_\ast(U_2) 
    \\
    & \subset \phi_\ast(U_{\emptyset}) 
    \\
    & = 
    \emptyset
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

(where the first equality holds because $\phi_\ast$ preserves finite intersections by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}, the inclusion holds because $\phi_\ast$ respects
inclusions by remark \ref{PreservationOfInclusionsByFrameHomomorphism}, and the second equality holds because $\phi_\ast$ preserves arbitrary unions by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}).
But in $\tau_\ast = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\}$ the intersection of two open subsets is empty precisely if at least one of them is empty,
hence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$ or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$. But this means that $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}$,
as claimed.

Now according to [this prop.](irreducible+closed+subspace#OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible)
this condition $(\ast)$ identifies the [[complement]] 
$X \backslash U_{\emptyset}$ as an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(X,\tau)$. 
Therefore by assumption of [[sober topological space|sobriety]] of $(X,\tau)$ there is a unique point
$x \in X$ with $X \backslash U_{\emptyset} = Cl(\{x\})$. In particular this means that for $U_x$ an open 
neighbourhood of $x$, then $U_x$ is not a subset of $U_\emptyset$, and so it follows that $\phi(U_x) = \{1\}$.
In conclusion we have found a unique $x \in X$ such that

$$
  \phi_\ast  
    \;\colon\;
  U \mapsto 
  \left\{
    \array{
      \{1\} & \vert \,\text{if}\, x \in U
      \\
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the the [[inverse image]] function of the continuous function $\ast \to X$ which sends $1 \mapsto x$.

Hence this establishes the bijection between frame homomorphisms of the form $\tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X$
and continuous functions of the form $\ast \to (X,\tau)$.

With this it follows that a general frame homomorphism of the form $\tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y$
defines a function of sets $X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ by [[composition]]:

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X)
    &\mapsto&
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous analysis, an element $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is sent to $\{1\}$ under this composite precisely if
the corresponding point $\ast \to X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is in $U_Y$, and similarly for 
an element $U_X \in \tau_X$. It follows that $\phi(U_Y) \in \tau_X$ is precisely that subset of 
points in $X$ which are sent by $f$ to elements of $U_Y$, hence that $\phi = f^{-1}$ is the [[pre-image]]
function of $f$. Since $\phi$ by definition sends open subsets of $Y$ to open subsets of $X$, it follows
that $f$ is indeed a continuous function. This proves the claim in generality.

### Reflection
 {#Reflection}

The [[category]] of sober spaces is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in the category of all topological spaces; the [[left adjoint]] is called the **soberification**.  

This reflection is also induced by the [[idempotent adjunction]] between spaces and [[locales]]; thus sober spaces are precisely those spaces that are the space of points of some [[locale]], and the [[category]] of sober spaces is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[locales with enough points]]. 

### Enough points

A topological space has enough points in the sense of def. \ref{EnoughPointsOfATopologicalSpace} if and only if its $T_0$ quotient is sober.  The category of topological spaces with enough points is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category [[Top]] of all topological spaces, and a topological space is [[T0]] iff this reflection is sober.


## Examples and Non-examples

* With [[classical logic]], every [[Hausdorff space]] is sober, but this can fail [[constructive mathematics|constructively]]. See at _[[Hausdorff implies sober]]_.

  {#NonComparisonToT1} Since the Hausdorff condition implies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]], this means that ([[classical logic|classically]]) there is a large [[intersection]] of the [[classes]] of $T_1$-topological spaces and sober topological spaces. But neither class is contained in the other, as the following counter-examples show:

  * The [[Sierpinski space]] is sober, but not $T_1$.

  * The [[cofinite topology]] on a non-[[finite set]] is $T_1$ but not sober. 

 
* The topological space underlying any [[scheme]] is sober. See at _[[schemes are sober]]_.


Further examples of spaces that are _not_ sober includes the following:

* Any nontrivial [[indiscrete space]] is not sober, since it is not $T_0$. 

More interestingly: 

* For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], then the space $R^2$ with the [[Zariski topology]] is $T_1$ but not sober, since every subvariety is an irreducible closed set which is not the [[topological closure|closure]] of a point.  Its _soberification_ is, unsurprisingly, the [[scheme]] $Spec(R[x,y])$, which contains "generic points" whose closures are the subvarieties. 

The following non-example shows that sobriety is not a hereditary separation property, i.e., [[topological subspaces]] of sober spaces need not be sober:

* The [[Alexandroff topology]] on a [[poset]] is also not, in general, sober.  For instance, if $P$ is the infinite binary tree (the set of finite $\{0,1\}$-words ([[lists]]) with the "extends" preorder), then the soberification of its Alexandroff topology is [[Wilson space]], the space of finite or infinite $\{0,1\}$-words ([[streams]]).
