## Idea

_Adjoint functor theorems_ are theorems stating that under certain conditions a [[functor]] that preserves [[limit]]s is a [[right adjoint]], and that a functor that preserves [[colimit]]s is a [[left adjoint]].


A basic result of [[category theory]] is that right [[adjoint functor]]s preserve all [[limit]]s that exist in their domain, and, dually, left adjoints preserve all [[colimit]]s.  An _adjoint functor theorem_ is a statement that (under certain conditions) the converse holds: a functor which preserves limits is a right adjoint.


The basic idea of an adjoint functor theorem is that _if_ we could assume that a [[large category]] $D$ had all [[limit]]s over [[small category|small]] and [[large category|large]] [[diagram]]s, then for $R : D \to C$ a [[functor]] that preserves all these limits we might define its would-be left adjoint $L$ by  taking  $L c$ to be the limit

$$
  L c \coloneqq \lim_{c\to R d} d
$$

over the [[comma category]] $c/R$ (whose objects are pairs $(d,f:c\to R d)$ and whose morphisms are arrows $d\to d'$ in $D$ making the obvious triangle commute in $C$) of the projection functor $\pi: c/R \to D$: 

$$
  L c = \lim\; (c/R \to D )
  \,.
$$

Because with this definition there would be for every $d$ an obvious morphism

$$
  L R d \stackrel{=}{\to} \lim_{R d \to R d'} d' \to d
$$

(the component map over $d$ of the limiting [[cone]]) while moreover because $R$ preserves limits, we would have an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  R L c \simeq \lim_{c\to R d} R d
$$ 

and hence an obvious morphism of [[cone]] tips

$$
 c \to R L c
 \,.
$$  

It is easy to check that these would be the unit and counit of an [[adjunction]] $L\dashv R$. See [[adjoint functor]] for more.

The problem with this would-be argument is that in general the comma category $(c/G)$ may not be [[small category]]. But one can generally not expect a large category to have all large limits: even if we pass to a [[universe]] in which $(c/G)$ is considered small, a classical theorem of Freyd says that any [[complete small category]] is a [[preorder]] (see [[complete small category]] for the proof, which is valid in [[classical logic]] and also holds classically in any [[Grothendieck topos]]).  Thus, the argument we gave above is necessarily an **adjoint functor theorem for preorders**: 

+-- {: .num_theorem #ForPosets}
###### Theorem

If $G:D\to C$ is any functor between (small) preorders such that $D$ has, and $G$ preserves, all small [[meet]]s, then $G$ has a left adjoint.

=--

(This theorem holds in [[constructive mathematics]], although not in [[predicative mathematics]]; the classical reasoning before this explains why the theorem is not more general, but the proof itself is already constructive.)

To obtain adjoint functor theorems for categories that are not preorders, one must therefore impose various additional "size conditions" on the category $D$ and/or the functor $G$.  


## Statement


+-- {: .num_theorem #StandardAdjointFunctorTheorem}
###### Theorem

Sufficient conditions for a limit-preserving functor $G : D \to C$ to be a [[right adjoint]] include:

* $D$ is [[complete category|complete]] and [[locally small category|locally small]], and $G$ satisfies the [[solution set condition]].  

  This is Freyd's original version, sometimes called the "**General Adjoint Functor Theorem**".

* $D$ is complete, locally small [[well-powered category|well-powered]], and has a [[small set|small]] [[cogenerating set]], and $C$ is [[locally small category|locally small]].  

  This is sometimes called the "**Special Adjoint Functor Theorem**", and abbreviated to SAFT.

* $D$ is locally small and [[total category|cototal]], and $C$ is locally small.

=--

In the first two cases, which work by replacing large limits by small ones, it suffices to assume that $G$ preserves small limits (that it preserves all limits will follow).  The third case works by assuming that $D$ has, while not all large limits, enough so that the theorem goes through; thus is this case $G$ must be already known to preserve [[large category|large]] limits as well.


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Here is a proof of the General Adjoint Functor Theorem: that a functor $R : C \to D$ out of a [[locally small category]] $C$ with all small limits has a left adjoint if it preserves these [[limit]]s and satisfies the [[solution set condition]]. 

From the discussion at <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint%20functor#UniversalArrows">adjoint functors -- In terms of universal arrows</a> we have that the existence of the adjoint is equivalent to the existence for each $d \in D$ of an [[initial object]] $i_d : d \to R L d$ in the [[comma category]] $(d \downarrow R)$: an object such that for each $f : d' \to R d$ there is a unique $\tilde f$ such that 

$$
  \array{
    && d 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i_d}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    R L d &&\underset{R \tilde f}{\to}&& R d'
    \\
    \\
    L d &&\underset{\tilde f}{\to}&& d'
  }
$$

commutes. Now an initial object is the limit of the identity functor, but this is generally a large limit; we replace this with some small limit conditions that guarantee existence of an initial object. 

1. Let $Y$ be a category. Call a small family of objects $F$ _weakly initial_ if for every object $y$ of $Y$ there exists $x \in F$ and a morphism $f: x \to y$. 

1. Suppose $Y$ has small products. If $F$ is a weakly initial family, then $\prod_{x \in F} x$ is a [[weak multilimit|weakly initial]] object. 

1. **Claim:** Suppose $Y$ is locally small and small complete. If $x$ is a weakly initial object, then the domain $e$ of the joint equalizer $i: e \to x$ of all arrows $x \to x$ is an initial object. **Proof:** clearly $e$ is weakly initial. Suppose given an object $y$ and arrows $f, g: e \to y$; we must show $f = g$. Let $j: d \to e$ be the equalizer of $f$ and $g$. There exists an arrow $k: x \to d$. The arrow $i: e \to x$ equalizes $1_x$ and $i j k: x \to x$, so $i j k i = i$. Since $i$ is monic, $j (k i) = 1_e$. Thus $j$ is an epi, and $f = g$ follows. 

If $C$ is locally small and small-complete and $R: C \to D$ preserves limits, then $d \downarrow R$ is locally small and small-complete for every object $d$ of $D$. 

If in addition each $d \downarrow R$ has a weakly initial family (solution set condition), then by 2. and 3. each $d \downarrow R$ has an initial object. This restates the condition that $R$ has a left adjoint.

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof of SAFT 
As before, the proof proceeds by constructing initial objects of comma categories. We assume that $C$ is locally small, small-complete, well-powered, has a cogenerating set $\{c_\alpha: \alpha \in A\}$, and that $R: C \to D$ is a small-continuous functor into a locally small category $D$. 

As before, for each object $d$ of $D$, the comma category $d \downarrow R$ is locally small and small-complete. Moreover, it is easy to check that it is well-powered, and that the set of all objects of the form $d \to R c_\alpha$ is a cogenerating set for $d \downarrow R$. 

It then remains to prove that any locally small, small-complete, well-powered category $X$ with a cogenerating set $\{k_s: s \in S\}$ has an initial object. The initial object $0$ is constructed as the intersection = pullback of all subobjects of $\prod_s k_s$, i.e., the minimal subobject. Then, given $f, g: 0 \to x$, the equalizer $Eq(f, g)$ is isomorphic to $0$ because $0$ is minimal, and so $f = g$: there is at most one arrow $0 \to x$ for each $x$. 

On the other hand, for each $x$ the canonical map 

$$i: x \to \prod_{s \in S} k_{s}^{\hom(x, k_s)}$$ 

is monic since the $k_s$ cogenerate. The following pullback of $i$, 

$$\array{
k & \to & x \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{i} \\
\prod_s k_{s}^1 & \stackrel{\prod_s k_{s}^!}{\to} & \prod_s k_{s}^{\hom(x, k_s)}
},$$ 
gives a subobject $k$ of $\prod_s k_s$ that maps to $x$, and into which $0$ embeds. Thus there exists a map $0 \to x$, and we conclude $0$ is initial. 
=--

In practice an important special case is that of functors between
[[locally presentable categories]]. For these there is the following 
version of an adjoint functor theorem.

+-- {: .num_theorem #AdjFuncTheoremForLocallyPresentableCats}
###### Theorem

Let $F : C \to D$ be a functor between [[locally presentable categories]]. Then

* $F$ has a [[right adjoint]] precisely if it preserves all small [[colimits]].

* $F$ has a [[left adjoint]] precisely if it is an [[accessible functor]] and preserves all small [[limits]].

=--

This is ([AdamekRosicky, theorem 1.66](#AdamekRosicky)).

Notice the accessibility condition. That this is indeed necessary is
discussed below in the section [In locally presentable categories](#InLocallyPresentableCategories).

## Examples {#Examples}

### In locally presentable categories
 {#InLocallyPresentableCategories}

The following is a counter-example, showing that the
necessity of the accesibility clause in theorem \ref{AdjFuncTheoremForLocallyPresentableCats}.

+-- {: .num_examle}
###### Example

For every infinite [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$, let 
$G_\kappa$ be a [[simple group]] of [[cardinality]] $\kappa$. 
Define the functor $ML:$ [[Group]] $\to$ [[Set]] to be the 
[[product]] of all the [[representable functors]] 
$Hom(G_\kappa,-)$. 
Since no group can admit a nontrivial 
[[homomorphism]] from proper-[[class]]-many of the $G_\kappa$, 
this functor does indeed land (or can be redefined to land) in [[Set]]. 
Since it is a product of representables, it is 
[[continuous functor|continuous]] 
(and of course [[Group]] and [[Set]] are 
[[locally presentable categories]]), 
but it is not itself representable (hence has no [[left adjoint]]).

[[André Joyal]] has been attributing this example to [[Saunders MacLane]],
It appears in print for instance right at the beginning of ([AdámekKoubekTrnková01](#AdamekKoubekTrnkova)).

###### Corollary

Let $F : C \to D$ be a [[functor]] between [[sheaf toposes]]. Then

* $F$ has a [[right adjoint]] precisely if it preserves all small [[colimits]];

* $F$ has a [[left adjoint]] precisely if it preserves all small [[limits]].

=--


### In presheaf categories 
 {#InPresheafCategories}

It is instructive to spell out the construction of the [[right adjoint]] from a colimit preserving functor $L$ in the simple case where all categories are [[categories of presheaves]]. This is a particularly simple case, but is useful in itself and serves as a template for the general case.

So let now $C$ and $D$ be [[small categories]] and 

$$
  L : PSh(C) \to PSh(D)
$$

a colimit-preserving functor. Then its [[right adjoint]] is given by

$$
  R A  := Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(-),A)
$$

as we shall check in a moment. But first notice that using the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] this may be rewritten as

$$
  \cdots \simeq \int^{c \in C} Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(c), X) \cdot c
$$

where the [[coend]] is equivalently given by the [[colimit]]

$$
  = \lim_{\underset{L c \to A}{\to}} c
  \,.
$$

This is the formula for the would-be right adjoint from the general discussion above, only that here the colimit is only over the representables, hence over a small category.

Now we check that the $R$ thus obtained is indeed right adjoint to $L$, by explicitly checking the hom-isomorphism of the pair of [[adjoint functor]]s:

We compute $Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(X),A)$. In the first step

$$
  Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(X), A)
  \simeq
  Hom_{PSh(D)}(L (\int^{c \in C} X(c) \cdot c), A)
$$

we use the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] for $X$. Then because $L$ preserves colimits this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq Hom_{PSh(D)}(\int^c X(c) \cdot L(c), A)
  \,.
$$

Since the hom preserves limits in both arguments, we can take the [[coend]] out to get an [[end]]

$$
  \cdots \simeq \int_{c \in C} Hom_{PSh(D)}(X(c) \cdot L(c), A)
$$

Then we use the standard [[copower|tensoring]] of our categories over [[Set]] to get

$$
  \cdots \simeq \int_{c \in C} Hom_{Set}(X(c), Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(c),A))
  \,.
$$

And finally this is recognized as the formula for the [[hom-set]] of presheaves (see [[functor category]])

$$
  \cdots \simeq Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, Hom(L(-),A)) = Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, R A)
  \,.
$$

In total this establishes the hom-isomorphism

$$
  Hom_{PSh(D)}(L(X), A) \simeq Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, R(A))
  \,.
$$
