## Definition

A **section** of a [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ in some [[category]] is a **right-[[inverse]]**: a [[morphism]] $\sigma : B \to A$ such that
$$
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B
$$
equals the [[identity morphism]] on $B$.

## Split idempotents

In the case that $f$ has a section $\sigma$, $f$ may also be called a [[retraction]] or **cosection** of $\sigma$, $B$ may be called a [[retract]] of $A$, and the entire situation is said to split the [[idempotent]]
$$
  A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A
  \,.
$$

A **[[split epimorphism]]** is a morphism that *has* a section; a **[[split monomorphism]]** is a morphism that *is* a section.  A [[split coequalizer]] is a particular kind of split epimorphism.

## Sections of bundles and sheaves

If one thinks of $f : A \to B$ as a [[bundle]] then its sections are sometimes called [[global sections]]. This leads to a notion of global sections of [[sheaves]] and further of objects in a general [[topos]]. See 

* [[global section]]

for more on this.
