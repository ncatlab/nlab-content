## Idea

_MOND_ is the abbreviation for _modified Newtonian gravity_. This refers to a simple formula that formally modifies the formula for Newtonian [[gravity]] in a way that surprisingly well fits the rotation-velocities of observed [[galaxies]] in dependece of the radius, something which the [[standard model of cosmology]] with [[dark matter]] still has some problems with fitting properly. 

There is no consensus as to what this modification of Newtonian gravity _means_. It must be a numerical fit to some kind of physics that is to date not understood more fundamentally.
