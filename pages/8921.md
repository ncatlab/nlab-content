## Idea

The [[standard model of cosmology]] including [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] is in very good agreement with observation on scales above those of galaxies, but in its standard version becomes problematic below this scale (there are variants that address this, such as [[fuzzy dark matter]]).

Curiously though, the particular behaviour of experimental data on these "small" cosmological scales turns out to have a surprisingly simple and universal phenomenological fit by a simple modification of the [[force]] law of [[Newtonian mechanics]] ("Newton's third law", corrections from [[general relativity]] are typically very small for the effects in question). 

_MOND_ is the abbreviation for this _modified Newtonian gravity_ ([Milgrom 83 a](#Milgrom83a), [Milgrom 83 b](#Milgrom83b), [Milgrom 83 c](#Milgrom83c)). This refers to a simple formula 

$$
  F = m \,\mu(a/a_0)\, a
$$

for some interpolating function $\mu \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
that formally modifies Newton's third law 

$$
  F = m a
$$

relating the [[force]] experienced by a body of [[mass]] $m$ to its [[acceleration]] $a$.

The motivation is that choosing the constant $a_0$ and the function $\mu$ suitably, then such a modified formula surprisingly well fits the rotation-velocities of observed [[galaxies]] in dependence of the radius, something which the [[standard model of cosmology]] with [[dark matter]] still has some problems with fitting properly (but see [Kaplinghat-Turner 02](#KaplinghatTurner02), [BLSF 09](#BLSF09), [Chan 13](#Chan13)). 


## Related concepts

* An alternative proposal is that of [[fuzzy dark matter]], where the theory of gravity is left as is, but one assumes that there is [[dark matter]] which is so extremely light that its [[de Broglie wavelength]] is of the scales of galaxies. Such [[fuzzy dark matter]] models make the ame prediction as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, but changes behaviour on scales of galaxies due to the [[quantum physics|quantum]] nature of these light particles becoming relevant here. This change of behaviour has been argued to account for the kind of effects that MOND is a fit for.
