Throughout, write 

* $Top \coloneqq Top_{cg}$ for the [[category]] of  [[compactly generated topological spaces]]; this is a "[[convenient category of topological spaces]]", in particular it is a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $(Top, \times)$;

* $Top^{\ast/}$ for the corresponding [[pointed topological spaces]]; this is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] equipped with the [[smash product]] of pointed objects;

* $Top_{Quillen}$ for the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] on this caterory; in particular this is a [[monoidal model category]] $(Top_{Quillen}, \times)$.

Throughout we are dealing with $(Top,\times)$-[[enriched categories]] and with $Top_{Quillen}$-[[enriched model categories]].

###### Definition

Define the following $Top$-[[enriched categories|enriched]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal categories]] (the [[tensor product]] is an [[enriched functor]]):

1. $Seq$ has as objects the [[natural numbers]] and has only identity morphisms, tensor product is the addition of natural numbers, tensor unit is 0;

1. $Sym$ a [[skeletal category|skeleton]] of the [[core]] of [[FinSet]], tensor product is the [[disjoint union]] of sets, tensor unit is the [[empty set]],

1. $Orth$ has as objects finite dimenional real linear [[inner product spaces]] and as morphisms the [[linear map|linear]] [[isometries]] between these;

1. $Top_{fin}^{\ast/}$ for the category of [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[finite CW-complexes]], tensor product is their [[smash product]], tensor unit is the [[0-sphere]].

The canonical inclusions give a sequence of [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]]

$$
 Seq \hookrightarrow Sym \hookrightarrow Orth \hookrightarrow Top_{fin}^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$

The [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$ is the canonical inclusion functor $Top_{fin}^{\ast/} \hookrightarrow Top^{\ast/}$ regarded as an object

$$
  \mathbb{S} \in [Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}]
$$

of the [[enriched functor category]].  By restriction along the above inclusions, this yields objects

$$
  \mathbb{S}_{Seq} \in [Seq, Top^{\ast/}]
$$

$$
  \mathbb{S}_{Sym} \in [Sym, Top^{\ast/}]
$$

$$
  \mathbb{S}_{Orth} \in [Orth, Top^{\ast/}]
  \,.
$$

Now the key is:

under [[Day convolution]] all these functor categories become [[symmetric monoidal categories]] themselves. But the ([[representable functor|functor represented]] by) the [[sphere spectrum]] is the [[tensor unit]] of that monoidal structure only for $Top^{\ast/}_{fin}$, not for $Seq$, $Sym$, $Orth$.
