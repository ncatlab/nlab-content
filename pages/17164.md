## Idea

For $S_\bullet$ a [[spectrum]], its _cylinder spectrum_ $Cyl(E)_\bullet$ has as component spaces

$$
  Cyl(E)_n \coloneqq I_+ \wedge E_n
$$

the [[smash product]] (of [[pointed topological spaces]]) of $E_n$ with the unit inveral with a dijoint basepoint adjoint.

Cylinder spectra serve to define [[left homotopy]] of spectra as for other [[cylinder objects]].
