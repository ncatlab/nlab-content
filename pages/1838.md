# Idea #

A configuration of the electromagnetic field on a space $X$ in the _absence_ of magnetic charge is modeled by a cocycle in degree 2 ordinary [[differential cohomology]].

This may be realized in particular by

* a $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] on $X$; 

* a degree 2 [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] on $X$.

In the presence of magnetic charge the electromagnetic field is modeled by a coycle in differential [[twisted cohomology]], where the twist is given by the differential 3-cocycle that models the magnetic current.

# Relation to the physical entities and notions #

In the following we describe how the abstract definition of the electromagnetic field as a differential cocycle encodes the physical observables of electromagnetism.

... connection 1-form locally on Minkwoski space ... decomposition in standard coordinates ... splitting of field strength into electric and magnetic parts ... 


# The old Dirac argument from a modern perspective #

In this section we describe how one finds from physical arguments that, indeed, the electromagnetic field is modeled by a differential refinement of an cocycle in degree 2 integral cohomology.

A central idea in this argument is famously due to Dirac. He thought of it as an argument for the quantization of [[margnetic current|magnetic charge]]. But from a modern perspective he identified the magnetic charge with the _Chern class_ of the line bundle with connection that represents the electromagnetic field outside of the support of the magnetic charge distribution.

... demand only that field is locally given by smooth 1-form  (Maxwell's equations + Poincar&eacute; lemma) and that a well-defined $U(1)$-valued holonomy exists (action functional for electrically charged particle) ... this already implies that we are dealing with a line bundle...old argument: "Dirac string"... modern complete argument: Barrett's description of bundle in terms of its holonomy homomorphism...
