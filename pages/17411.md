## Idea

__Elementary mathematics__ is a conventional term used in the mathematics education denoting the part of mathematics curriculum which does not require advanced, nonstandard or conceptually deep level of background. In more narrow sense, in 20-th century university education, elementary mathematics usually denotes standard school and university mathematics without usage of infinitesimal calculus. Though most good approaches to elementary mathematics include setting up basic foundational issues at the appropriate level (for example the principles of proofs etc.), elementary mathematics should be distinguished from the foundations of mathematics.

### Educational theory on elementary mathematics

* wikipedia: [Modern elementary mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_elementary_mathematics)

> Modern elementary mathematics is the theory and practice of teaching elementary mathematics according to contemporary research and thinking about learning. This can include pedagogical ideas, mathematics education research frameworks, and curricular material.

### General references on elementary mathematics

* [[Felix Klein]], _Elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint_

The following book is a unique attempt by two prominent mathematicians to give an elementary introduction to [[category theory]] directed at beginning students and general readers which is relevant to school education as well:

* [[F. William Lawvere]], [[Stephen H. Schanuel]], _Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories_ , Cambridge UP 1997.

One should note that the category theory is not traditionally considered a part of elementary mathematics even if some parts can be exaplained in elementary way (the same is true for the simplest parts of infinitesimal calculus). 

### References on elementary geometry

Here we try to include only mathematically sound references which brought something new or are very influential, pedagogically original or well written.
