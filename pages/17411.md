## Idea

__Elementary mathematics__ is a conventional term used in mathematics education concerning the part of the subject which does not require advanced, nonstandard or conceptually deep level of background. 
It is also a term in 20-th century university education where elementary mathematics usually denotes mathematics without usage of infinitesimal calculus. Though most good approaches to elementary mathematics include setting up basic foundational issues at the appropriate level (for example the principles of proofs etc.), elementary mathematics should be distinguished from the foundations of mathematics.
