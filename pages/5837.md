## Definition

The _diffeomorphism group_ $Diff(X)$ of a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the [[group]] of its [[diffeomorphism]]s: the [[automorphism group]] of $X$ as an [[object]] of the [[category]] [[SmoothMfd]].

Beware that when $X$ is assumed [[orientable]] then sometimes, but not always, $Diff(X)$ is implicitly taken to be the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. 



## Properties

### Relation to homotopy equivalences

For the following kinds of manifolds $\Sigma$ it is true that every [[homotopy equivalence]] 

$$
  \alpha \colon \Pi(\Sigma) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Pi(\Sigma)
$$

(hence every [[equivalence of infinity-groupoids|equivalence]] of their [[fundamental infinity-groupoids]]) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]

$$
  a \colon \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma
$$

i.e. that given $\alpha$ there is $a$ with

$$
  \alpha \simeq \Pi(a)
  \,.
$$


* for $\Sigma$ any [[surface]] ([Zieschang-Vogt-Coldeway](#ZieschangVogtColdeway))

* for $\Sigma$ a [[Haken 3-manifold]] ([Waldhausen](#Waldhausen68)) 

* for $\Sigma$ any  [[hyperbolic manifold]] of finite [[volume]] and of [[dimension]] $\geq 3$ (by [[Mostow rigidity theorem]]) (check)

### Homotopy type and mapping class group
 {#HomotopyTypeAndMappingClassGroup}

The [[homotopy type]] $\Pi(Diff(\Sigma))$ of the diffeomorphism group $Diff(\Sigma)$ is of interest (e.g. [Hatcher 12](#Hatcher12)).

For instance this is the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of a manifold, regarded as a [[k-morphism]] in an [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]].

Specifically, the group of connected components is the [[mapping class group]]

$$
  \pi_0(\Pi(Diff(\Sigma))) = MCG(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

#### For 1-manifolds

$$
  \Pi(Diff(S^1))\simeq \Pi(O(2))
$$

$$
  \Pi(Diff(D^1))\simeq \Pi(O(1))
$$

###### Proposition


For $\Sigma$ a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[orientation|orientable]] [[surface]], then the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid|bare homotopy type]] of its diffeomorphism group is

1. if $\Sigma$ is the [[sphere]] then
 
   $$
     \begin{aligned} 
        \Pi(Diff(S^2)) & \simeq \Pi(O(3))
        \\
        & \simeq MCG(S^2)\times \Pi(SO(3))
        \\
        & \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \Pi(SO(3))
     \end{aligned}
   $$

1. if $\Sigma$ is the [[torus]] then

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       \Pi(Diff(S^1 \times S^1)) 
       & \simeq 
       MCG(S^1 \times S^1)\times \Pi(S^1 \times S^1 )
       \\
       & \simeq GL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \times B(\mathbb{Z} \times\mathbb{Z})
     \end{aligned}
   $$ 

1. in all other cases all higher [[homotopy groups]] vanish:

   $$
     \Pi(Diff(\Sigma)) \simeq MCG(\Sigma)
   $$

The first statement is due to ([Smale 58](#Smale58)), see also at _[[sphere eversion]]_. The second and third are due to ([Earle-Eells 67](#EarleEells67), [Gramain 73](#Gramain73)).

$$
  \Pi(Diff(S^1 \times S^2))
  \simeq
  \Pi(O(2) \times O(3))

  \Omega \Pi(SO(3))

+-- {: .num_theorem #SmaleConjecture}
###### Theorem **(Smale conjecture)**

The bare homotopy type of the diffeomorphism group of the 3-sphere is that of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(4)$

$$
  \Pi(Diff(S^3)) \simeq \Pi(O(4))
  \,,
$$

the equivalence being exhibited by the canonical inclusion

$$
  O(4) \hookrightarrow Diff(S^3)
  \,.
$$

Also

$$
  \Pi(Diff(D^3)) \simeq \Pi(O(3))
  \,.
$$

After being conjectured by Smale, this was proven in ([Hatcher 1983](#Hatcher)).

###### Theorem

For every [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[3-manifold]] the canonical map

$$
  \Pi(Diff(X)) \to \Pi(Homeo(X))
$$

sending [[diffeomorphisms]] to their underlying [[homeomorphisms]] of [[topological spaces]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

=--

That this follows from the Smale cojecture, theorem \ref{SmaleConjecture}, was shown in ([Cerf](#Cerf)). For discussion see ([Hatcher, 1978](#Hatcher78)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If a 3-manifold $X$ is not a [[Seifert 3-manifold]] via an $S^1$-action then

$$
  \Pi(Diff(X)) \simeq MCG(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

If $X$ is Seifert via an $S^1$-action, then the component of $Diff(X)$ are typically $\Pi(S^1)$-s.
