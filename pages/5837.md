## Definition

The _diffeomorphism group_ $Diff(X)$ of a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the [[group]] of its [[diffeomorphism]]s: the [[automorphism group]] of $X$ as an [[object]] of the [[category]] [[SmoothMfd]].

## Examples

### Of the 3-sphere

+-- {: .num_theorem #SmaleConjecture}
###### Theorem

The diffemorphism group of the 3-sphere is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to the [[orthogonal group]] $O(4)$, the equivalence being exhibited by the canonical inclusion

$$
  O(4) \hookrightarrow Diff(S^3)
  \,.
$$

After being conjectured by Smale, this was proven in ([Hatcher 1983](#Hatcher)).

### Of general 3-manifolds

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For every [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] 3 the canonical map

$$
  Diff(X) \to Homeo(X)
$$

sending [[diffeomorphisms]] to their underlying [[homeomorphisms]] of [[topological spaces]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

=--

That this follows from the Smale cojecture, theorem \ref{SmaleConjecture}, was shown in [Cerf](#Cerf). For discussion see [Hatcher, 1978](#Hatcher78).
