## Idea

The 0-mode of the supercharge in a [[2d SCFT]] behaves like a higher dimensional analog of the operator $D$ in a [[spectral triple]], hence the supercharge in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. Specifically for a [[sigma-model]] 2d SCFT induced from some [[target space]] geometry it is a higher version of a [[Dirac operator]] on that space (roughtly like a Dirac operator on the [[smooth loop space]]). This is called the _Dirac-Ramond operator_ (after [[Pierre Ramond]]).

The [[index]] of the [[large volume limit]] of the Dirac-Ramond operator is what is now known as the [[Witten genus]] (but in fact the original article ([Alvarez-Killingback-Mangano-Windey 87](#AlvarezKillingbackManganoWindey87)
) appeared independently almost in parallel of Witten's discussion).
