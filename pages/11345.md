## Idea

The 0-mode of the [[supercharge]] in a [[2d SCFT]] (an operator in a ([[sheaf of vertex operator algebras|sheaf of]]) [[super vertex operator algebra]]) behaves like a higher dimensional analog of the operator $D$ in a [[spectral triple]], hence like the supercharge in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] (see the references [there](supersymmetric+quantum+mechanics#InStringTheory)).  

Specifically for a [[sigma-model]] [[2d SCFT]] induced from some [[target space]] geometry -- such as the [[worldsheet]]-[[quantum field theory]] of a [[superstring]] propagating on that [[target spacetimes]] -- the Dirac-Ramond operator is a [[2-spectral triple|higher analogue]] of a [[Dirac operator]] on that [[target spacetime]] (roughly like what one would expect of a [[Dirac operator on a smooth loop space]]). This is called the _Dirac-Ramond operator_ ([Ramond 71](#Ramond71)).

The [[index]] of the [[large volume limit]] of the Dirac-Ramond operator is what is now known as the [[Witten genus]] (but in fact the original article [Alvarez-Killingback-Mangano-Windey 87](#AlvarezKillingbackManganoWindey87)
 appeared independently and almost in parallel of Witten's discussion).

### General

The original article, in the context of the [[superstring]] of [[string theory]]"

* {#Ramond71} [[Pierre Ramond]], _Dual theory for Free Fermions_, Phys Rev. D3  2415 (1971) ([doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.3.2415](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.3.2415))


The Dirac-Ramond operator originates with the early beginning of [[superstring]] models, when they were still called _[[spinning strings]]_ -- see [there](spinning+string#References) for more references.

The concept gained more attention in pure mathematics when it was found that the [[large volume limit]]  of its [[index]], when properly construed, is a universal [[elliptic genus]], now known as the [[Witten genus]]. See [there](elliptic+genus#EllipticGeneraAsBranePartitionFunctionsReferences) for more references.
