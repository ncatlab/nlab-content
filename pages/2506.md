The **[new version of latest changes at the Forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5)** has gone live.

Those who had [concerns about the change](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=64) seem to have stood aside (although it\'s a little hard to tell without a formal process), so the lab elves have taken it as understood that we can at least try this out.  Please use it for October; if it stinks, then we can change back for November.  (Of course, nobody can force you to do this, so we won\'t stop you from posting here anyway ... but please try the new version out.)

The instructions are at [this Forum discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=98), where you can also ask questions if you have any.

The announcement of the change and the reasons for it have been [archived](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/revision/2009+September+changes/397).
