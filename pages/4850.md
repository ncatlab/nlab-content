A **pseudoadjunction** is a kind of weak [[2-adjunction]].  Sometimes the word is used interchangeably with [[biadjunction]] to mean a "fully weak" notion of 2-dimensional adjunction.  Other times, a "pseudoadjunction" refers to the weakest kind of 2-adjunction definable in a [[Gray-category]], which when specialized to the prototypical Gray-category $Gray$ consists of strict 2-categories and strict 2-functors, but pseudonatural transformations.
