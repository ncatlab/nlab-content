## Idea 

What is called _global equivariant homotopy theory_ is a variant of [[equivariant cohomology]] in [[homotopy theory]] where [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological spaces]]/[[homotopy types]] are equipped with $G$-[[infinity-actions]] "for all [[compact Lie groups]] $G$ at once".

Sometimes this is referred to just as "global homotopy theory", leaving the equivariance implicit. There is also a [[stabilization|stable]] version involving [[spectra]] equipped with [[infinity-actions]], see at _[[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]]_.
