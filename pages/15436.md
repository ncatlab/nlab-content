## Idea

In the context of [[number theory]], given an [[algebraic number field]] $K$ (a finite-dimensional [[field]] extension of $\mathbb{Q}$), then its _ring of integers_ is the sub-ring $\mathcal{O}_K \hookrightarrow K$ of _integral elements_, which are those that are [[roots]] of [[polynomials]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}$ whose top degree coefficient is 1 ("monic polynomials"). 

Alternatively, an element $\alpha \in K$ is an __[[algebraic integer]]__ if the subring $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \hookrightarrow K$ generated by $\alpha$ is of finite rank over $\mathbb{Z}$. This makes it plain that the algebraic integers themselves form a [[ring]]: if $\alpha, \beta \in \mathcal{O}_K$ are integral, then both $\alpha - \beta$ and $\alpha \beta$ are contained in the image of the induced map $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[\beta] \to K$, which is also of finite rank. 

For $K = \mathbb{Q}$ the [[rational numbers]] then $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}} \simeq \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[commutative ring]] of ordinary [[integers]].
