While a [[ring]] is a set with two operations, monoid with respect to one and semigroup wit respect to another with a standard two-sided distributivity law, a truss is a similar structure with a different distributivity law. They appear in a number of subjects including the study of solutions to [[quantum Yang-Baxter equation]], ideal ring extensions, [[Hopf-Galois extension]]s etc.
