While a [[ring]] is a set with two operations, (Abelian) group with respect to one and semigroup with respect to another with a standard two-sided distributivity law, a truss is a similar structure with a so called "brace-like" distributivity law instead. They appear in a number of subjects including the study of solutions to [[quantum Yang-Baxter equation]], ideal ring extensions, [[Hopf-Galois extension]]s, [[inverse semigroup]]s etc. 

If we drop Abelianess of the "additive" group then we talk about a more general notion of a skew truss (which is therefore to [[near-ring]] roughly what a truss is to a ring).

## Examples

* All even numbers form a (nonunital) subring of the ring of integers. Another coset, the class $2\mathbb{Z}+1$ of all odd numbers is closed under multiplication, but not under addition. However, if we introduce the new addition $a\oplus b = a - 1 + b$ then
$2\mathbb{Z}+1$ is closed under both operation and the brace-like distributive law holds $a\cdot(b \oplus c) = a\cdot b \ominus a \oplus a\cdot c$.
