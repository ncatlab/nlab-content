I'm a graduate student in mathematics at Brown University studying with [[Tom Goodwillie]]. [Here](https://www.math.brown.edu/~kferendo/) is my webpage. My research interest is [[higher category theory]].

My undergraduate institution was Amherst College, where I studied with [[Michael Ching]]. I've decided to fill out this page so that when I make tweaks to $n$Lab articles, people know who is to blame.

If you'd like to contact me for any reason, I can be reached at kferendo (at) math (dot) brown (dot) edu.
