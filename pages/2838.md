## Idea ##

The notion of [[Grothendieck topos]] is often presented as a generalisation of that of [[topological space]], one in which the points of the space may have non-trivial [[automorphism]]s. However, the analogy is not precise, since in a topological space, it is the points which have conceptual priority over the open sets, whereas in a topos it is the other way around. Hence a topos is more correctly regarded as a generalised [[locale]], than as a generalised space. 

The notion of _ionad_ stands in the same relationship to a topological space as a (Grothendieck) topos does to a locale.

Ionads have been introduced and studied in

Some basic aspects of the theory are developed there and applications to topology, logic and geometry are discussed.
