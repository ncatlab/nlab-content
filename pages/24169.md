## Idea ##

The [[homotopy type theory]] presented in the [[HoTT book]]. 

## Definition ##

__Book homotopy type theory__ or **Book HoTT** is a [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory|Martin-Löf]] [[univalent type theory]] with all the additional types mentioned in the HoTT book:

* [[W-types]]
* [[inductive families]]
* [[mutually inductive types]]
* [[inductive-inductive types]]
* [[inductive-recursive types]]
* [[higher inductive types]]
* [[higher inductive-inductive types]]
* [[higher inductive-recursive types]]
