## Idea

In [[physics]], specifically in [[field theory]], the _Dirac field_ of _[[spinor]] field_ is the kind of [[field (physics)|field]] whose [[quanta]] are the [[fermions]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]], such as [[electrons]], [[quarks]], [[neutrinos]] and [[muons]].

Mathematically, the Dirac field is the [[field (physics)|field]] whose [[field bundle]] is a [[spinor bundle]] in [[supergeometry|odd super-degree]] and whose [[equation of motion]] is a [[Dirac equation]].

Notice that there are other [[spinor]] [[field (physics)|fields]] which would not be called "Dirac fields". For example the [[gravitino]] field would be called a _[[Rarita-Schwinger field]]_.
