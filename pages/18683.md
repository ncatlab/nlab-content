## Idea

In [[physics]], specifically in [[field theory]], a _Dirac field_ is an [[electromagnetism|electromagentially]] charged and possibly [[mass|massive]] a _[[fermion|fermionic]] [[spinor]] field_.

This includes [[fermions]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]], such as [[electrons]], [[quarks]], [[neutrinos]] and [[muons]], after the [[Higgs mechanism]] has equipped them with [[mass]].

Mathematically, the Dirac field is the [[field (physics)|field]] whose [[field bundle]] is a [[spinor bundle]] with typical [[fiber]] a [[Dirac representation]] in [[supergeometry|odd super-degree]] and whose [[equation of motion]] is a [[Dirac equation]].

Notice that there are other [[spinor]] [[field (physics)|fields]] which would not be called "Dirac fields", such as those transforming in a [[Majorana representation]] or a [[Weyl representation]], or for example the [[gravitino]] field which would be called a _[[Rarita-Schwinger field]]_.
