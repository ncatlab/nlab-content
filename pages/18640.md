## Idea

A **thunk-force category** is a category that models [[call-by-value]] programming languages with effects.
More commonly, terms in a call-by-value language are modelled as morphisms in the [[Kleisli category]] of a [[strong monad]].
A thunk-force category axiomatizes the Kleisli category _directly_ and is also called an **abstract Kleisli category**[^terminology].
The original category can be recovered from this category if it satisfies certain properties.

## Definition

A thunk-force category [Führmann 99](F99) consists of

* a category $K$
* a functor $L : K \to K$
* a [[unnatural transformation|possibly unnatural transformation]] $\theta : Id_K \to L$ pronounced **thunk**
* a [[natural transformation]] $\epsilon : L \to Id_K$ pronounced **force**

such that

* $\theta L$ is a natural transformation
* $(L\theta)\theta = (\theta L)\theta$
* $\epsilon\theta = \id$
* $(L\epsilon)(\theta L) = \id$

A morphism $f : A \to B$ in a thunk-force category is **thunkable** if $(Lf)\theta = \theta f$.
Another way to phrase the definition is that $(L,\epsilon,\theta L)$ is a comonad and $\theta$ is thunkable.

## Relation to Monads

The [[Kleisli category]] of any [[monad]] is a thunk-force category.
The thunkable morphisms in a thunk-force category form a subcategory, and $L$ can be used to define a monad on that subcategory whose Kleisli category is equivalent to $K$.
These two constructions exhibit thunk-force categories as a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of monads.

[^terminology]: We prefer the term thunk-force category since it is ambiguous whether [[Kleisli category]] refers to the Kleisli category of a [[monad]] or a [[comonad]].
