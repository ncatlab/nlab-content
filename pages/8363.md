## Idea

Second-order arithmetic is a [[theory]] dealing with natural numbers and, what makes it "second-order", sets of natural numbers. SOA, or $Z_2$ as it is often denoted, is [[proof theory|proof-theoretically]] weak in comparison with [[ZFC]], but still strong enough to derive "almost all of undergraduate mathematics" (Friedman).
