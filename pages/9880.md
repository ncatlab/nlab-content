## Idea

An effect in [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] that cannot be seen in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is called a _non-perturbative effect_.

More in detail, [[theory (physics)|theories]] with [[instantons]] [[field (physics)|field]] configurations (such as in [[Yang-Mills theory]], hence in [[QCD]] and [[QED]]) or [[branes]] (such as in [[string theory]]), etc., are expected to have [[observables]] which as [[functions]] of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ are [[transseries]] of the form

$$
  Z(g)
  = 
  \sum_n a_n g^n
  + 
  e^{-A/g}
  \sum_n a_n^{(1)} g^n
  +
  e^{-B/g^2}
  \sum_n b_n^{(1)} g^n
  \,,
$$

where the first sum is the [[Feynman perturbation series]] itself and where the terms with a [[analytic function|non-analytic]] dependence of the form $\exp(-A/g)$ or $\exp(-A/g)$ are the contributions of the [[instantons]]. Since all the [[derivatives]] of the functions $g \mapsto e^{-1/g}$ or $$g \mapsto e^{-1/g^2}$$ vanish at [[coupling constant]] $g = 0$, the [[Taylor series]] of this part of the observble does not appear in [[perturbative QFT]], even though it is present. Therefore this is called a _non-perturbative effect_.

## Examples


### Confinement and the mass gap

A central example of a non-perturbative effect is [[confinement]] (hence the "mass gap") in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Perturbation theory is not suited to explain this (e.g [Espiru 94, section 7](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9410287)).

The form of the contribution of non-perturbative effects in string theory was originally observed in

### In M-Theory

The relation of non-pertrubative effects in string theory to [[M-theory]] goes back to

In [Becker-Becker-Strominger 95](#BeckerBeckerStrominger95) it was realized that the [[worldsheet instantons]] and [[D-brane instantons]] of string theory unify to [[membrane instantons]] (see [Marino 15, section 1.3](#Marino15))
