## Idea

An effect in [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] that cannot be seen in [[perturbation theory]].

More in detail, [[theory (physics)|theories]] with [[instantons]] [[field (physics)|field]] configurations (such as in [[Yang-Mills theory]], hence in [[QCD]] and [[QED]]) or [[branes]] (such as in [[string theory]]), etc., are expected to have a  [[path integral]] which as a [[function]] of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ schematically looks like

$$
  Z(g)
  = 
  \sum_n a_n g^n
  + 
  e^{-A/g}
  \sum_n a_n^{(1)} g^n
  + 
  \mathcal{O}(e^{-2A/g})
  \,,
$$

where the first sum is the [[perturbation series]] itself and where the terms with a prefactor of the form $\exp(-A/g)$ are the contributions of the [[instantons]] ($A$ is the contribution of the [[instanton]] [[action functional]]). Since all the [[derivatives]] of the function $g \mapsto e^{-1/g}$ vanish at [[coupling constant]] $g = 0$, the [[Taylor series]] of this part of the path integral does not appear in [[perturbation series]], even though it is present. Therefore this is called a _non-perturbative effect_.

## Examples

### Confinement and the mass gap

A central example of a non-perturbative effect is [[confinement]] (hence the "mass gap") in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Perturbation theory is not suited to explain this (e.g [Espiru 94, section 7](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9410287)).
