## Idea

An effect in [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] that cannot be seen in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is called a _non-perturbative effect_.

More in detail, [[theory (physics)|theories]] with [[instantons]] [[field (physics)|field]] configurations (such as in [[Yang-Mills theory]], hence in [[QCD]] and [[QED]]) or [[branes]] (such as in [[string theory]]), etc., are expected to have [[observables]] which as [[functions]] of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ are [[transseries]] of the form

$$
  Z(g)
  = 
  \sum_n a_n g^n
  + 
  e^{-A/g}
  \sum_n a_n^{(1)} g^n
  +
  e^{-B/g^2}
  \sum_n b_n^{(1)} g^n
  \,,
$$

where the first sum is the [[Feynman perturbation series]] itself and where the terms with a [[analytic function|non-analytic]] dependence of the form $\exp(-A/g)$ or $\exp(-A/g)$ are the contributions of the [[instantons]]. Since all the [[derivatives]] of the functions $g \mapsto e^{-1/g}$ or $g \mapsto e^{-1/g^2}$ vanish at [[coupling constant]] $g = 0$, the [[Taylor series]] of this part of the observble does not appear in [[perturbative QFT]], even though it is present. Therefore this is called a _non-perturbative effect_.

Related is _[[resurgence theory]]_. See also at _[perturbation theory -- Divergence/convergence](perturbation+theory#DivergenceConvergence)_ for more.

## Examples


### Confinement and the mass gap

A central example of a non-perturbative effect is [[confinement]] (hence the "mass gap") in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Perturbation theory is not suited to explain this (e.g [Espiru 94, section 7](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9410287)).

### Worldsheet and brane instantons in string/M-theory
 {#WorldsheetAndBraneInstantons}


Consider the [[M-theory]] [[scales]]

* $\ell_P$, the [[Planck length]] in 11-dimensions;

* $R_{10}$ the [[length]] (circumference) of the $S^1_{10}$ [[circle]] [[fiber]] for [[KK-compactification]] to 10 dimensions

and the [[string theory]] [[scales]]

* $\ell_s$, the [[string length scale]];

* $g_{s}$, the [[coupling constant]] of [[perturbative string theory]].


Then under the [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]] these scales are related as follows:

$$
  \ell_P \;=\; g_{st}^{1/3} \ell_s
  \,,
  \phantom{AAA}
  R_{10} \;=\; g_{st} \ell_s
$$

equivalently

$$
  \ell_s \;=\; R_{10}/ g_{st}
  \,,
  \phantom{AAA}
  \ell_P \;=\; g_{st}^{-2/3} R_{10}
$$

equivalently

$$
  g_{st} \;=\; (R_{10}/\ell_P)^{3/2}
  \,,
  \phantom{AAA}
  \ell_s \;=\; \ell_P (R_{10}/\ell_P)^{-1/2}
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[membrane instanton]], which on a 3-[[cycle]] $C_3$ gives a contribution

$$
  \exp\left(
    - \frac{ vol(C_3) }{ \ell^3_P }
  \right)
$$

becomes 

1. if the cycle [[wrapped brane|wraps]], $C_3 = C_2 \cup S^1_{10}$, a [[worldsheet instanton]]

   $$
     \exp\left( - \frac{ vol(C_3) }{ \ell_P^3 }  \right) 
     \;=\; 
     \exp\left( - \frac{ R_{10} vol(C_2) }{ g_{st} \ell_s^3 }  \right)
     \;=\;
     \exp\left( - \frac{ vol(C_2) }{ \ell_s^2 }  \right)
   $$

1. the cycle does not [[wrapped brane|wrap]], a spacetime instanton contribution, specifically a [[D2-brane instanton]]

   $$
     \exp\left( - \frac{ vol(C_3) }{ \ell_P^3 }  \right)
     \;=\;
     \exp\left( - \frac{ vol(C_3)/\ell_s^3 }{ g_{st} }  \right)
   $$
   
   
(This unification of the two different [[non-perturbative effects]] in [[perturbative string theory]]
([[worldsheet instantons]] and spacetime [[instantons]]), to a single type of effect ([[membrane instanton]])
 in [[M-theory]] was maybe first made explicit in [Becker-Becker-Strominger 95](#BeckerBeckerStrominger95). Brief review includes [Marino 15, sections 1.2 and 1.3](#Marino15)).

### In string theory

The form of the contribution of non-perturbative effects in string theory was originally observed in 

* [[Stephen Shenker]], _The Strength of nonperturbative effects in string theory_, presented at the Cargese Workshop on Random Surfaces, Quantum Gravity and Strings, Cargese, France, May 1990 ([spire](http://inspirehep.net/record/298523?ln=en))

The interpretation via [[D-branes]] of non-perturbative effects in the string [[coupling constant]] is due to

The identification of non-perturbative contributions in [[string theory]] with brane contributions is due to

### In M-Theory

The relation of non-perturbative effects in string theory to [[M-theory]] goes back to

* {#Witten95} [[Edward Witten]], section 2.2 of _[[String Theory Dynamics In Various Dimensions]]_, Nucl.Phys.B443:85-126,1995 ([arXiv:hep-th/9503124](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124))

In [Becker-Becker-Strominger 95](#BeckerBeckerStrominger95) it was realized that the [[worldsheet instantons]] and [[D-brane instantons]] of string theory unify to [[membrane instantons]] (see [Marino 15, section 1.3](#Marino15))
