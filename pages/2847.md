## Idea

A **large cardinal** is a [[cardinal number]] that is larger than can be proven to exist in the ambient [[set theory]], usually [[ZF]] or ZFC.  Large cardinals arrange themselves naturally into a more or less linear order of size and consistency strength, and provide a convenient yardstick to measure the consistency strength of various other assertions that are unprovable from ZFC.
