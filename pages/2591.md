
#Definition#

The _special orthogonal group_ $SO(n)$ is the [[connected component]] of the neutral element in the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$.

It is the first step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$

[[fivebrane group]] to [[string group]] to [[spin group]] to **special orthogonal group** to [[orthogonal group]].

#Orientation of manifolds#

For $X$ an $n$-dimensional [[manifold]] a lift of [[generalized the|the]] classifying map $X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of the $O(n)$-[[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ is [[associated bundle|associated]] is the same as a choice of [[orientation]] of $X$.
