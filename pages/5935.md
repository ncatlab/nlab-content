## Idea

We discuss how a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] that is equipped with a notion of [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|infinitesimal cohesion]] induces a notion of [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]], hence formally defines a  [[higher geometry]] with a good notion of cohesively [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es that suitably adapts and generalizes the notion of [[locally ringed space]] and [[locally ringed topos]].

Every [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is (in a tautological but useful way), the [[classifying topos]] (see there for details) for a [[theory]] $\mathbb{T}$ of [[local algebra|local]] [[∞-algebra over an (∞,1)-algebraic theory|∞-algebras]]. 

This means that for $\mathcal{X}$ any [[(∞,1)-topos]] and 

$$
  A : (\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}} \dashv R) : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbf{H}
$$

a [[geometric morphism]], we may think of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}$ as exhibiting a [[structure sheaf]] of local $\mathbb{T}$-algebras in $\mathcal{X}$.

For this general abstract construction to accurately reflect a notion of [[higher geometry]], this setup needs to be equipped with a suitable choice of admissible morphisms between such $\infty$-structure sheaves. This is encoded by a choice of morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$ that qualify as [[open map]]s in a suitable sense. Such a choice then gives rise to a notion of [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]].

We discuss below how in the case that $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] equipped with [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal cohesion]] these [[open map]]s are canonically and intrinsically induced: they are the [[formally etale morphism]]s with respect to the given notion of infinitesimal cohesion.

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

We may regard $\mathbf{H}$ as the [[classifying topos]] for a [[theory]] $\mathbb{T}$ of [[local algebra]]s. 

For $\mathcal{X}$ any [[(∞,1)-topos]] a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  (\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}} \dashv R ) : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbf{H}
$$

therefore exhibits on $\mathcal{X}$ the structure of a [[locally algebra-ed topos|locally T-algebraed topos]]: a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] ([Lurie](#Lurie)).

Let in addition $i : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ be an [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood]]. This induces a notion of [[formally étale morphism]]s in $\mathbf{H}$.

We say a morphism $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}} \to \mathcal{O}'_{\mathcal{X}}$ of $\mathbb{T}$-structures is **local**, if its components on [[formally étale morphism]]s are [[(∞,1)-pullback]] squares.

Formally etale morphisms do satisfy the axioms on admissibile maps, according to <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos+--+infinitesimal+cohesion#PropertiesOfFormallyEtaleMorphisms">this propositon</a>

The subcategory spanned by the local morphisms of $T$-structures on $\mathcal{X}$ we write
