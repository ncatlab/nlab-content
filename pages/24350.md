## Idea

_Arithmetic gauge theory_ is a theory proposed by [Kim 2018 ](#Kim18) to look at [[Galois representations]] with an action of another group (the [[gauge group]]) as being analogous to [[gauge fields]] in [[gauge theory]]. It is an approach to Diophantine problems such as the effective [[Mordell conjecture]] and is influenced by the theory of the Selmer group and Chabauty's method.

## Definitions

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $G_{K}$ be its absolute Galois group. A _gauge group over $K$_ is a topological group $U$ with an action of $G_{K}$.

A _$U$-gauge field_, or _$U$-principal bundle_, is a topological space $P$ with compatible continuous left $G_{K}$-action and simply transitive continuous right $U$ action.

## Examples

This section follows section 8 of [Kim 2018](#Kim18).

Let $V$ be a variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ equipped with a base point $b\in V(\mathbb{Q})$. For our gauge group $U$ we let

$$U=\pi_{1}(\overline{V},b)_{\mathbb{Q}},$$

the $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-pro-unipotent fundamental group of $V$. For our gauge field $P$ we let

$$P(x)=\pi_{1}(\overline{V},b,x),$$ 

the $U$-torsor of pro-unipotent paths from $b$ to $x$.

Let $S$ be a finite set of primes. Let $H_{f}^{1}(\mathbb{Z}_{S},U)$ be the set of $U$-torsors over $\mathbb{Q}$ which are unramified outside $S$ and crystalline at $p$. Similarly let $H^{1}(\mathbb{Q}_{p},U)$ be the set of $U$-torsors over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. We have a localization map

$$H_{f}^{1}(\mathbb{Z}_{S},U)\to\prod_{p}' $H^{1}(\mathbb{Q}_{p},U)$$

where the restricted product on the right means that all but finitely many of the components are unramified, and at $p$ the corresponding component is crystalline. We want to determine the image of this localization map.
