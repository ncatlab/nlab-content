## Idea

Every [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]] has a [[stabilization]] to a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $Stab(\mathcal{C})$. This stabilization may be defined by abstract properties, but it may also be constructed explicitly as the category of _spectrum objects_ in $\mathcal{C}$.

In the special case that $\mathcal{C} = $ [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq L_{whe}$[[Top]], a spectrum object in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[spectrum]] in the traditional sense. There is an evident generalization of the traditional notion of [[Omega-spectrum]] from [[Top]] to any $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]]: a spectrum object $X_\bullet$ is essentially a list of [[pointed objects]] $X_i$ together with [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalences]] $X_i \to \Omega X_{i+1}$, from every object in the list to the [[loop space object]] of its successor. 

## Definition

### Via $\Omega$-spectrum objects

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ an [[(∞,1)-category]], a **prespectrum object**  of $\mathcal{C}$ is 

* a $(\infty,1)$-functor $X : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathcal{C}$

* such that for all integers $i \neq j$ we have $X(i,j) = 0$ a [[zero object]] of $\mathcal{C}$

Notice that this definition is highly redundant. The point is that writing $X[n] \coloneqq X(n,n)$ a spectrum object is for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ a (homotopy) [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    X[n+1] &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    0 &\to& X[n]
  }
    \,.
$$

Recalling that in an [[(infinity,1)-category]] with [[zero object]]

* $\Omega X[n+1]$ denotes the pullback of such a diagram;

* $\Sigma X[n]$ denotes the pushout of such a diagram

this induces maps

$$
  \alpha_n : \Sigma X[n] \to X[n+1]
$$

$$
  \beta_{n+1} : X[n] \to \Omega X[n+1]
  \,.
$$

A prespectrum object is

* a **spectrum object** if $\beta_m$ is an equivalence for all for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ (a __spectrum below $n$__, if $\beta_m$ is an equivalence for all $m \leq n$);

* a **suspension spectrum** if $\alpha_m$ is an equivalence for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ (a __suspension spectrum above $n$__, if $\alpha_m$ is an equivalence for all $m \geq n$).

([StabCat](#StabCat))

One writes

* $Sp(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $Fun(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z},C)$ on spectrum objects in $C$;

* $Stab(\mathcal{C}) \coloneqq Sp(\mathcal{C}_*)$ -- the **stabilization of $C$** for the $(\infty,1)$-category of spectrum objects in the $(\infty,1)$-category $C_*$ of [[pointed object]]s of $\mathcal{C}$.

### Via excisive functors

Write $\infty Grpd^{fin}$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] freely generated by [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]] from a single object.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]]. Then a **spectrum object** in $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[excisive (∞,1)-functor]] 

$$
  \infty Grpd^{fin} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

### In an ordinary category

One can define $\Phi$-symmetric $F$-spectra in a category $C$, where $\Phi$ is a [[graded monoid]] in the [[category]] of [[groups]] and $F : C \to C$ is a $\Phi$-symmetric [[endofunctor]] of $C$.  Here we follow [Ayoub](#Ayoub).

1.  Let $\Phi$ be a [[graded monoid]] in the category of [[groups]].  Explicitly this is the data of [[groups]] $\Phi_n$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$ with morphisms $\Phi_m \times \Phi_n \to \Phi_{m+n}$ for all $m,n \ge 0$ (subject to various axioms...).  $\Phi$ will usually be either $\Sigma = (\Sigma_n)_n$, the [[graded monoid]] of [[symmetric groups]], or $1 = (1_n)_n$, the [[graded monoid]] of [[trivial group]]s.

2.  A **$\Phi$-[[symmetric sequence]]** in $C$ is a [[sequence]] of objects $(X_n)_{n \ge 0}$ together with [[actions]] $a_n : \Phi_n \to \Aut_C(X_n)$.  We write $Seq(\Phi, C)$ for the category of $\Phi$-[[symmetric sequences]].  See [[symmetric sequence]] for details.

3.  A **$\Phi$-symmetric endofunctor** of $C$ is an [[endofunctor]] $F : C \to C$ together with [[actions]] $\Phi_n \to Aut(F^n)$.  Usually $F$ will be the functor $T \otimes_C -$ induced by [[tensor product]] with some object $T$.

4.  Let $F : C \to C$ be a $\Phi$-symmetric [[endofunctor]].  A **$\Phi$-symmetric $F$-spectrum** in $C$ is a $\Phi$-[[symmetric sequence]] $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbf{N}}$ together with **assembly morphisms**
  $$ \gamma_n : F(X_n) \to X_{n+1} $$
such that the composite morphism
  $$ F^m(X_n) \to F^{m-1}(X_{n+1}) \to \cdots \to X_{m+n} $$
is $(\Phi_m \times \Phi_n)$-[[equivariant]].  (Note that $\Phi_m$ acts on $F^m$ by the definition of [[symmetric endofunctor]], and $\Phi_n$ acts on $X_n$ by the definition of [[symmetric sequence]].)  A morphism of $\Phi$-symmetric $T$-spectra $X = (X_n)_n \to Y = (Y_n)_n$ is a morphism of $\Phi$-[[symmetric sequences]] making the obvious [[diagrams]] [[commutative diagram|commute]].  We write $Spect^{\Phi}_F(C)$ for the category of $\Phi$-symmetric $F$-spectra in $C$.

5.  When $\Phi = \Sigma$, the [[graded monoid]] of [[symmetric groups]], $\Sigma$-symmetric $F$-spectra are called simply **symmetric $F$-spectra**.  When $\Phi = 1$, $1$-symmetric $F$-spectra are called simply **nonsymmetric $F$-spectra**.  When the endofunctor $F$ is given by $T \otimes -$ for some object $T \in C$, $F$-spectra are called $T$-spectra.

6.  Consider the [[evaluation]] functor
  $$ Ev^n : Spect_F^{\Phi}(C) \to C $$
which "evaluates" a symmetric spectrum at its $n$th component.  Assuming that $C$ admits appropriate [[colimits]] and $F$ commutes with them, $Ev^n$ admits a left adjoint
  $$ Sus^n : C \to \Spect_F^\Phi(C) $$
called the $n$th [[suspension]] functor.

7.  Let $T \in C$ be an object and consider the $\Sigma$-[[symmetric sequence]] $Sym(T)$ whose $n$th component is $Sym(T)_n = T^{\otimes n}$ (with the [[actions]] of $\Sigma_n$ by permuting the $n$ factors).

8.  **Proposition.**  $Sym(T)$ is a commutative [[algebra object]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] $Seq(\Sigma, C)$.

9.  By the previous proposition there is a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $Mod_\ell(Sym(T))$ where $X \otimes_{Sym(T)} Y$ is defined as the [[coequalizer]] of the diagram
  $$ X \otimes Sym(T) \otimes Y \rightrightarrows X \otimes Y. $$

10.  Note that one has a tautological [[equivalence of categories]]
  $$ \Spect^\Sigma_T(C) \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} \Mod_\ell(Sym(T)). $$
In particular one gets a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $Spect^\Sigma_T(C)$.

11.  **Proposition.** One has
  $$ Sus^p_T(X) \otimes Sus^q_T(Y) \simeq Sus^{p+q}_T(X \otimes Y) $$
for all $X,Y \in C$.  In particular, $Sus = Sus^0 : C \to \Spect^\Sigma_T(C)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]].


## Properties

### As a model for stabilization

If $C$ is a pointed $(\infty,1)$-category with finite [[limit in quasi-categories|limits]], then $Sp(C)$ is a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]].

### Reflection into pre-spectrum objects

For $\mathcal{C}$ an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] and [[(∞,1)-colimits]], then the inclusion of spectrum objects into prespectum objects 
should be a [[exact (∞,1)-functor|left exact]] [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] inclusion ([Joyal 08, section 35](#Joyal08)).

$$
  Spec(\mathcal{C})
  \stackrel{\overset{lex}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PreSpec(\mathcal{C})
  \,.
$$

This implies in particular that the [[tangent (∞,1)-category]] of an [[(∞,1)-topos]]
is itself again an [[(∞,1)-topos]] ([Joyal 08, section 35.5](#Joyal08)), see at _[tangent (∞,1)-category -- Tangent (∞,1)-topos](tangent+%28infinity%2C1%29-category#TangentTopos)_ .

## Examples

For $C = Top$, $Stab(C)$ is the $(\infty,1)$-category version of the classical stable homotopy category of spaces: the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]].
