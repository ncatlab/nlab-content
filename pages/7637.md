Basic examples

* [[sphere]], [[ball]], [[torus]], [[real line]], [[real n-dimensional space]], [[interval]], [[long line]]

Many classes come from standard constructions from other spaces or maps like

* [[quotient space]], [[subspace]] (as subset with induced topology), [[loop space]], [[free loop space]], [[suspension]], [[mapping cylinder]], [[mapping cone]], [[quotient space]], [[Fadell's configuration space]]

or from data which includes some parameters or algebraic data as input like

* [[Grassmanian]]s, [[flag varieties]]

and as representing object of some functor, or (more or less the same), as [[moduli space]]s of some structures

* [[classifying space]], [[Milnor construction]]

There are also classes of spaces which are often presented by standard recipes. For examples, manifolds may be presented by manifold atlases

Locally badly behaved spaces include

* [[Sierpinski space]], [[Warsaw circle]], [[fractal]], [[solenoid]]

Many examples are mentioned, or searched for, in the compendium of open problems
