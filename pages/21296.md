## Idea

False vacuum eternal inflation (FVEI) can occur whenever the [[inflaton]] [[potential energy|potential]] $V(\phi)$ has multiple [[minima]] â€” in the simplest case one [[false vacuum]] (a [[local minimum]] $\phi = \phi_{\mathrm{F}}$ in the potential where $V(\phi) \gt 0$) and one true [[vacuum]] (the global minima of the potential).

At any given point in space, [[quantum tunneling]] from the [[false vacuum]] to the true vacuum will eventually occur, as first found by [Coleman & De Luccia 1980](#ColemanDeLuccia1980). In such a tunneling event, these authors found that a true vacuum bubble will form that will expand at a rate close to the [[speed of light]]. The interior of such a bubble will be described by an open (i.e. $k = - 1$) [[FRW model|Friedmann universe]] of infinite size. For this reason, false vacuum inflation also goes by the name of "open inflation".

If the tunneling rate per unit [[time]] and [[volume]] is sufficiently small, then once bubbles nucleate they will not be able to coalesce due to the intervening rapidly inflating false vacuum between the bubbles. In this case [[inflation]] never ends globally, leading to a [[multiverse]] picture where bubble universes nucleate ad infinitum (hence the name "[[eternal inflation]]"). Our [[observable universe]] would, in this picture, only be an infinitesimal portion of a single bubble universe out of a coutless others.
