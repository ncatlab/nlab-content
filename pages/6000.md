## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **transitive** if it has a single [[orbit]], i.e., if for every two points $x,x'$ there exists $g\in G$ such that $x' = \rho(g,x)$.  A set equipped with a transitive action of $G$ (and which is [[inhabited]]) is the same thing as a [[connected object]] in the category $G Set$.

More generally, an action of $G$ on $X$ is said to be _$k$-transitive_ if the 
componentwise-action of $G$ on $X^k$ is transitive.  For example, $\rho$ is said to be 3-transitive if for any two ordered triples $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and $(x_1',x_2',x_3')$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $x_1' = \rho(g,x_1)$ and $x_2' = \rho(g,x_2)$ and $x_3' = \rho(g,x_3)$.

## Examples

The [[alternating group]] $A_n$ acts transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ for any $n \gt 2$, but not for $n = 2$ (in fact, $A_n$ acts $(n-2)$-transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$).

The [[projective general linear group]] $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ acts 3-transitively on the [[Riemann sphere]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$.
