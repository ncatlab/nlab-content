## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is _transitive_ if it has a single [[orbit]], i.e., if for every two points $x,x'$ there exists $g\in G$ such that $x' = g x$.  A set equipped with a transitive action of $G$ (and which is [[inhabited]]) is the same thing as a [[connected object]] in the category $G Set$.
