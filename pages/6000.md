## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **transitive** if it has a single [[orbit]], i.e., if for every two points $x,x'$ there exists $g\in G$ such that $x' = \rho(g,x)$.  A set equipped with a transitive action of $G$ (and which is [[inhabited]]) is the same thing as a [[connected object]] in the category $G Set$.

More generally, an action $G \times X \to X$ is said to be _$k$-transitive_ if the componentwise-action $G \times (X^k \setminus \Delta) \to (X^k \setminus \Delta)$ of $G$ on tuples of $k$ distinct points is transitive.  (For instance, an action is 3-transitive if any triple of distinct points can be mapped by the componentwise-action to any other triple of distinct points.)

## Examples

The [[alternating group]] $A_n$ acts transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ for any $n \gt 2$, but not for $n = 2$ (in fact, $A_n$ acts $(n-2)$-transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$).

The [[projective general linear group]] $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ acts 3-transitively on the [[Riemann sphere]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$.
