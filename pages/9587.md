## Idea

In the context of [[noncommutative geometry]]/[[KK-theory]], a _generalized elliptic operator_ is a [[linear operator]] of a [[Hilbert bimodule]] over two [[C*-algebras]] $A, B$ in [[C*Alg]], such that in the special case that $A = C_0(Y)$ and $B = C_0(Y)$ for $X,Y$ [[smooth manifolds]], this reduces to a $Y$-parameterized collection of ordinary [[elliptic operators]] on $X$.
