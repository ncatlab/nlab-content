## Definition

A **simplicial $C^\infty$-ring** is a [[simplicial object]] in the category of [[generalized smooth algebra|C∞-rings]].

## Applications

When equipped with the [[model structure on simplicial algebras]] over the [[Lawvere theory]] [[CartSp]], simplicial $C^\infty$-rings are a model for [[smooth (∞,1)-algebras]], hence for $(\infty,1)$-algebras over [[CartSp]] regarded as an  [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]].


Therefore, in higher analogy to how $C^\infty$-rings serve as function algebras on [[smooth loci]] in [[differential geometry]], so simplicial $C^\infty$-rings serve as function rings on [[derived smooth manifold]]s and more general spaces in [[derived differential geometry]].
