## Idea

A [[differential operator]] whose [[principal symbol]] is hyperbolic (...)

Over a [[Lorentzian manifold]] a _normally hyperbolic differential operator_ is a hyperbolic differential operator whose [[principal symbol]] coincides with the given [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]].

A _[[Green hyperbolic differential operator]]_ is a hyperbolic differential operator that behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential operator]] on a [[globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].
