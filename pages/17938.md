## Idea

The original "Peano (space-filling) curve" is a _[[surjective]]_ [[continuous function]] $I \to I^2$, from the [[closed interval]] $I = [0, 1]$ to the [[product space|product]] with itself, the [[square]]. The existence of such an entity (due to Peano) came as a surprise. 

One may characterize exactly which [[Hausdorff spaces]] arise as the continuous [[images]] of a unit interval. These are called *Peano spaces*. 

One can similarly show that there is a continuous surjection $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ from the [[real line]] to the [[plane]] (both regarded as [[Euclidean spaces]] equipped with their [[metric topology]]), and similarly characterize which spaces arise as continuous images of the real line. These are sometimes called *$\sigma$-Peano spaces*. 

Notice that, while of course there is also an injection $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$, there is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] between these two spaces, or generally between [[Euclidean  spaces]] of differing [[dimension]]. This is the statement of _[[topological invariance of dimension]]_.

## Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem 

The eponymous theorem may be stated as follows:

###### Theorem 
A [[Hausdorff space]] $X$ admits a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[surjection]] $f: I \to X$ from the [[closed interval]] $I$ if and only if it is a [[connected space|connected, locally connected]] [[compact space|compact]] [[metrizable space]].

(N.B. According to the nLab, connected spaces are [[inhabited set|nonempty]]!) 

The "only if" half is relatively easy; see [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connected+space#arcconnectedness) for some details. The "if" half is rather more involved, but [Willard's General Topology](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486434796/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) contains a proof. A space $X$ satisfying the stated conditions is called a **Peano space**. 

Given this characterization, it is not difficult to characterize which spaces are continuous images of $\mathbb{R}$:

###### Theorem 
A [[path-connected space|path-connected]] Hausdorff space $X$ admits a continuous surjection $\mathbb{R} \to X$ if and only if it is a $\sigma$-Peano space, i.e., a countable union $\bigcup_{n: \mathbb{N}} A_n$ of Peano spaces.

###### Proof 
The "only if" half being fairly obvious, the "if" part may be proved as follows. Since there are continuous surjections $[0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty)$, it suffices to show that a $\sigma$-Peano space admits a continuous surjection from $[0, \infty)$. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ choose a continuous surjection $f_n: [2 n, 2 n + 1] \to A_n$. Then for each $n$ choose a path $g_n: [2 n + 1, 2 n + 2] \to X$ such that $g_n(2 n + 1) = f_n(2 n + 1)$ and $g_n(2 n + 2) = f_{n+1}(2 n + 2)$. Then the $f_n$ and $g_n$ paste together to form a continuous surjection $[0, \infty) \to X$.

An example of such a space is the [[Warsaw circle]].
