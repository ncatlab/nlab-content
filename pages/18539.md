The algebra of [[quantum observables]] of a [[quantum field theory]] with non-trivial [[interaction]] is often called the _interacting field algebra_, in contrast to the [[Wick algebra]] for non-interacting [[free fields]].

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the interacting field algebra may be constructed from the [[Wick algebra]] by "conjugation" with the [[S-matrix]] of the interaction. A mathematically rigorous formulation of this construction is the content of [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]].

More abstractly, the interacting field algebra in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is simply the ([[Fedosov deformation quantization|Fedosov]]-)[[formal deformation quantization]] of the algebra of [[microcausal functionals]] induced on the [[covariant phase space]] of the given interating [[Lagrangian density]]. That this general [[quantization]] prescription is in fact equivalent to the traditional construction via the [[S-matrix]] was shown in ([Collini 16](#Collini16), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](#HawkinsRejzner16)).
