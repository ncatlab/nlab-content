A $3$-groupoid is any of several concepts that generalize $2$-[[2-groupoid|groupoids]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. The original notion is that of a globular [[strict 3-groupoid]], but the one most often used here is that of a [[weak 3-groupoid]]. The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoids]].

# Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$3$-groupoid__ is an $\infty$-groupoid such that all [[parallel pair]]s of $j$-morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $j \geq 4$. Thus, up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $3$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $3$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than your preferred definition of $3$-groupoid, but it will be equivalent; basically, you may have to rephrase equivalence of $3$-morphisms as [[equality]].
