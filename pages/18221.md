## Idea

One may consider [[internal categories]] in [[homotopy type theory]]. Under the [[relation between type theory and category theory|interpretation]] of [[HoTT]] in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]], this corresponds to the concept of a [[category object in an (infinity,1)-category]]. The general idea is presented there at _[Homotopy Type Theory Formulation](category+object+in+an+%28infinity%2C1%29-category#HomotopyTypeTheoryFormulation)_.

For internal [[1-categories]] in HoTT (as opposed to more general internal [[(infinity,1)-categories]]) a comprehensive discussion was given in ([Ahrens-Kapulkin-Shulman-13](#AhrensKapulkinShulman13)).
