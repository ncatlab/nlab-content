on [[complex oriented cohomology]], the [[Adams spectral sequence]], indicating the modern picture of [[E-infinity geometry]] over the "[[derived stacks]]" formally dual to [[S]] and [[MU]].

A predecessor is

* [[Frank Adams]], _[[Stable homotopy and generalised homology]]_, 1974

Much of this is later discussed more comprehensively in the lectures

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010
