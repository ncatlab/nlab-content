In a [[symmetric monoidal category]], a __bimonoid__ is an object $B$ equipped with a structure of a [[monoid]] and a [[comonoid]] which are compatible in one of two equivalent ways: the comultiplication and the counit are morphisms of monoids or the multiplication and the unit are morphisms of comonoids.  The symmetry of the monoidal structure is involved in the definition of the tensor product $B\otimes B$ as monoids and as comonoid. 

It is interesting how to generalize this notion in various nonsymmetric situations, for example involving [[braided monoidal category|braidings]], or in relative situations over noncommutative rings (e.g. Takeuchi bialgebroids). In the completely noncommutative situation of the monoidal category of endofunctors, one can look at various compatibilities between [[monad]]s and comonads or monads and tensor products, for example involving distributive laws.

As far as compatibility with tensor product is concerned, there is a notion of a bimonad and involves a version of [[distributive law]]s, hence it is related to a lifting problem:

There is also a more subtle notion also called Hopf monad in

Unlike the case of [[Hopf algebra]]s, one does not have good analogues of antipode map in general and a difference between a bimonoid and Hopf monoid has to be stated in different terms. A similar case is in the case of Hopf algebroids and bialgebroids where the most natural (and general) notions do not involve antipode:
