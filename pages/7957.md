In the context of the [[standard model of particle physics]], _technicolor_ is a proposal for realizing [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] not via a [[Higgs boson]] which is a [[fundamental particle]], but by realizing it as a bound state of auxiliary [[fermions]] and introduing new [[gauge fields]].
