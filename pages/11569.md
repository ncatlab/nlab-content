## Idea

The [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from [[abelian groups]] to [[commutative monoids]] has a [[left adjoint]] $G$. This is called _group completion_.

A standard presentation of the group completion is the [[Grothendieck group]] construction.

Group completion plays a central role in the definition of [[K-theory]].

More generally, there is 

$$
  K \;\colon\;  CMon_\infty(\infty Grpd) \longrightarrow AbGrp_\infty(\infty Grpd)
$$

the [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] to the inclusion of [[abelian ∞-groups]] ([[connective spectra]]) into [[commutative monoid object in a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|commutative ∞-monoids]] in [[∞Grpd]] ([[E-∞ spaces]]). This may be called _$\infty$-group completion_.

This serves to define [[algebraic K-theory of symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]].
