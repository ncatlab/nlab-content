## Definition

An **identity-on-objects [[functor]]** $F: A\to B$

* Is between [[categories]] with the same [[set]] of [[objects]], i.e. $Obj = ob(A) = ob(B)$, and
* Has as its underlying object function $F_{ob}: Obj \to Obj$ the [[identity function]] on $Obj$. 

## Equivalence-invariance

This simple definition appears to go against the [[principle of equivalence]], since it mentions equality of objects, and indeed identity of *sets* of objects.

However, the notion of "two categories with an identity-on-objects functor between them", which is much more commonly used than the notion of "an identity-on-objects functor between two previously given categories", can be defined in a more invariant way.  Explicitly, it consists of one set $Ob$ of objects, two families of arrows $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$ for $x,y\in Ob$, each with composition and identities making them into a category structure, plus a family of functions $A(x,y) \to B(x,y)$ commuting with these category structures.

More abstractly, this can be defined as a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[arrow category]] $Set^\to$.  See also [[M-category]] and [[F-category]].
