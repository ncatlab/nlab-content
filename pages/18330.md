## Definition

### In set theory

In set theory, an **identity-on-objects [[functor]]** $F: A\to B$ between [[categories]] $A$ and $B$ is a functor between categories with the same [[set]] of [[objects]], i.e. $Obj = ob(A) = ob(B)$, and has as its underlying object function $F_{ob}: Obj \to Obj$ the [[identity function]] on $Obj$. 

#### Equivalence-invariance

This simple definition appears to go against the [[principle of equivalence]], since it mentions equality of objects, and indeed identity of *sets* of objects.

However, the notion of "two categories with an identity-on-objects functor between them", which is much more commonly used than the notion of "an identity-on-objects functor between two previously given categories", can be defined in a more invariant way.  Explicitly, it consists of one set $Ob$ of objects, two families of arrows $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$ for $x,y\in Ob$, each with composition and identities making them into a category structure, plus a family of functions $A(x,y) \to B(x,y)$ commuting with these category structures.

More abstractly, this can be defined as a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[arrow category]] $Set^\to$.  See also [[M-category]] and [[F-category]].

### In type theory

In [[type theory]], an **identity-on-objects [[functor]]** $F: A\to B$ between [[categories]] $A$ and $B$ in a [[univalent universe]] $\mathcal{U}$ is a functor between categories with the same [[type]] of [[objects]], i.e. there exists a type $Obj:\mathcal{U}$ and [[identity types]] $a:Obj =_\mathcal{U} ob(A)$ and $b:Obj =_\mathcal{U} ob(B)$, and has as its underlying object function $F_{ob}: Obj \to Obj$ the [[identity function]] on $Obj$. If we assume that the [[strict category|categories are strict]], in the sense that the objects of a category form an [[set]], the identity types above are [[set]]s as well. If we assume the categories are [[univalent categories]], then the identity types in the definition above are [[groupoids]]. This is in contrast to the situation in [[set theory]] where identity/equality is always a [[proposition]].
