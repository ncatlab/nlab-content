By classical results due to Nikulin, Mukai, Xiao and Kondo in the 1980's and 90's, the finite [[symplectic group|symplectic]] [[automorphism groups]] of [[K3]] surfaces are always subgroups of the [[Mathieu group]] $M_{24}$. This is a [[sporadic finite simple group]] of order 244823040. However, also by results due to Mukai, each such automorphism group has at most 394 elements and thus is by orders of magnitude smaller than $M_{24}$. On the other hand, according to a recent observation by Eguchi, Ooguri and Tachikawa, the 
[[elliptic genus]] of [[K3]] surfaces seems to contain a mysterious footprint of an [[action]] of the entire group $M_{24}$: If one decomposes the [[elliptic genus]] into irreducible [[characters]] of the [[SCFT|N=4 superconformal algebra]], which is natural in view of superconformal field theories ([[SCFT]]s) associated to K3, then the coefficients of the so-called non-[[BPS state|BPS]] characters coincide with the [[dimensions]] of [[representations]] of $M_{24}$.
