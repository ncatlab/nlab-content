Given a theory in first-order logic with equality (categorically, this can be taken as a [[first-order hyperdoctrine]]), its category of partial equivalence relations represents all the [[subquotient]]s the theory can "see" of its given sorts and all the functions the theory can "see" between them.

Specifically, the objects of this category are pairs $(X, R)$ where $X$ is a sort in the first-order theory and $R$ is a binary predicate which the theory proves to be a [[partial equivalence relation]] on $X$. A morphism between objects $(X, R)$ and $(Y, S)$ can be taken to be a binary predicate $F \in P(X \times Y)$ such that the theory proves $F$ is essentially the graph of a function between the specified subquotients (In detail: ...). Composition is given in the obvious way (In detail: ...).

In the case where the original hyperdoctrine was in fact a [[tripos]], the resulting category of PERs will be a [[topos]] (while the converse isn't quite true, the condition of being a tripos is just slightly stronger than necessary for this to happen).
