Any triple of distinct points in a projective line can be transformed by a [[projective transformation]] (an element of $PGL(1)$) to another given triple of distinct points. Therefore no projective invariant can be attached to a triple of points and if three points are the starting parameters for some problem in projective geometry we may and typically do give them fixed values of $0,1,\infty$. 

The simplest projective invariant can be attached to a quadruple of points and it is the cross ratio.

$$
(A,B,C,D) = \frac{A - C}{A - D}\frac{B - D}{B - C}
$$

If the cross ratio for $(A,B,C,D)$ is $\lambda$ and the order of the four points is changed than the cross ratio takes one of the following values, depending on the permutation:

$$
\lambda, \frac{1}\lambda, 1-\lambda, \frac{\lambda - 1}\lambda, \frac{1}{1-\lambda}, \frac\lambda{\lambda-1}
$$
