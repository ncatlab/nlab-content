Any triple of distinct points in a [[projective line]] over a [[field]] $K$ may be transformed by a [[projective transformation]] (an element of [[projective general linear group|PGL(2,K)]], in the case of $K = \mathbf{C}$ (the [[complex numbers]]) known as a [[Möbius transformation]]) to another given triple of distinct points (i.e., the group $PGL(2,K)$ is 3-transitive on the projective line). Therefore no projective invariant can be attached to a triple of points and if three points are the starting parameters for some problem in projective geometry we may and typically do give them fixed values of $0,1,\infty$. The unique element in $PGL_2(K)$ that takes $(A, B, C)$ to $(\infty, 0, 1)$ may be described as the [[fractional linear transformation]] 

$$p_{A, B, C}: z \mapsto \frac{z - B}{z - A} \cdot \frac{C - A}{C - B}$$  

The simplest projective invariant can be attached to a quadruple of points and it is the cross ratio. It can be expressed in various ways, e.g., 

$$
(A,B,C,D) \coloneqq \frac{A - C}{A - D}\frac{B - D}{B - C}
$$

but it is the value $p_{A, B, C}(D)$ using the fractional linear transformation above. 

If the cross ratio for $(A,B,C,D)$ is $\lambda$ and the order of the four points is changed than the cross ratio takes one of the following values, depending on the permutation:

$$
\lambda, \frac{1}\lambda, 1-\lambda, \frac{1}{1-\lambda}, \frac{\lambda - 1}\lambda, \frac\lambda{\lambda-1}
$$
