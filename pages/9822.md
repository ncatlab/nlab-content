Let $X$ be a [[noetherian scheme]].  One defines a notion of [[rational equivalence]] on $X$ which, roughly speaking, identifies [[algebraic cycles]] that are connected by a family of cycles parametrized by the [[projective line]].

A cycle $C \in Z_k(X)$ is **rationally equivalent to zero** if there are [[closed subspace|closed]] [[integral scheme|integral]] subschemes $Z_\alpha$ of [[dimension]] $k + 1$ and invertible [[rational functions]] $r_\alpha \in R(Z_\alpha)^*$ such that

$$ 
  C = \sum_\alpha j_{\alpha,*}(div(r_\alpha)) \,,
$$

where

* $div$ denote the associate [[Weil divisors]];

* $j_{\alpha,*}$ denotes the [[direct image]] along the inclusion $Z_\alpha \hookrightarrow X$.

Rational equivalence generalizes [[linear equivalence]] of [[Weil divisors]].  It is an example of an [[adequate equivalence relation]].
