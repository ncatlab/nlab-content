A **quantale** is a [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal]] [[suplattice]].  This means it is a poset having all [[join]]s and an associative, unital tensor product $\otimes$ which distributes over joins (the internal-homs then come automatically by the [[adjoint functor theorem]]).  The internal-homs in a quantale are sometimes called _residuations_ and written $x\backslash y$ and $y/x$.

Additional conditions often imposed on a quantale include:

* Commutativity: $x\otimes y = y\otimes x$
* Idempotence: $x\otimes x = x$
* The unit for $\otimes$ is the top element: $1=\top$.

If all three of commutativity, idempotence, and $1=\top$ are assumed, they force $\otimes$ to be the [[meet]] and therefore the quantale to be a [[frame]].  General quantales are sometimes considered to be a "noncommutative" version of a frame, whose [[opposite category]] would be a category of "noncommutative [[locale]]s" (hence the name, a [portmanteau](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of "quantum" and "locale").

Now, if you really thought of quantales as quantum locales, then you would define a morphism of quantales to go backwards.  What does the literature say about that?  ---Toby

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I think that whatever the origins of the name, quantales are generally treated in the literature as more like "quantum frames" than "quantum locales."  Note, though, that in the past, it was common to use the word "locale" for what we now call a "frame" and simply distinguish between "locale homomorphisms" and "continuous maps."

_Toby_:  That explains it then, thanks.

##### Example #####

Quantales are a surprisingly commonplace structure in computer science. A very simple example is the powerset of strings (i.e., the powerset of the free monoid over some set of characters $\Sigma$). The order is the inclusion order on sets, and meet and join are just intersection and union, respectively. Taking $\epsilon$ to be empty string, and $a \cdot b$ to the join of two string, the quantalic operations are then:

* $1 = \{\epsilon\}$
* $L \otimes M = \{ l\cdot m \;|\; l \in L, m \in M \}$

###$*$-quantale###

A $*$-quantale is a quantale $Q$ equipped with an additional structure of an involution 

$$ * : Q \to Q$$ 

for which $(x \otimes y)^* = y^* \otimes x^*$ and $1^* = 1$, where $1$ denotes the monoidal unit. (The operator is assumed to be covariant with respect to the poset structure.)
