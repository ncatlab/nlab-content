## Idea

If $C$ is a [[finitely complete category]] (a category with all finite limits), then it\'s interesting to consider a left [[exact functor]] on $C$ (a functor that preserves all [[finite limit]]s).  Even if $C$ lacks some finite limits, then this concept still makes sense, but it may not be the correct one.  Instead we use the stronger concept of a _flat functor_, which may be thought of as a functor that preserves all finite limits ---even the ones that don\'t exist yet!



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[functor]] $F: C \rightarrow D$ is **flat** if for each [[object]] $d \in D$, the [[opposite category|opposite]] [[comma category]] $(d / F)^{op}$ is a [[filtered category]].

###### Remark

Some authors call this precisely a [[exact functor|left exact functor]], see the definition there.

## Properties

### General

###### Proposition

If $F : C \to D$ is flat, then it [[preserved limit|preserves]] any [[finite limit]]s that exist in $C$.  

A partial converse holds: if $C$ has enough finite limits and $F$ preserves these, then $F$ is flat.

###### Proposition

If $F : C \to D$ is a [[flat functor]] and 

$$
  [C^{op}, Set] \leftarrow [D^{op},Set] : F^* 
$$

is its action on [[presheaves]] by precomposition, then the corresponding [[left adjoint]] $F_!$

$$
  (F_! \dashv F^*) : [D^{op}, Set] \stackrel{\overset{F_!}{\to}}{\underset{F^*}{\leftarrow}}
  [C^{op},Set]
$$

preserves [[finite limit]]s.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The left adjoint is the left [[Kan extension]] along $F$

$$
  F_! \simeq Lan_F
  \,.
$$

Since [[presheaf topos]]es have all [[colimit]]s, this is computed on any object $c \in C$ (as discussed at [[Kan extension]]) by the [[colimit]]

$$
  (F_! X(c) = \lim_{\to} \left( 
     (d/F)^{op} \to C^{op} \stackrel{F}{\to} Set
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $(d/F)$ is the corresponding [[comma category]] and $(d/F)^{op} \to C^{op}$ is the canonical projection.

Now, by definition $F$ being flat is equivalent to $(d/F)^{op}$ being a [[filtered category]]. So this is a [[filtered colimit]]. By the discussion there, it is precisely the filtered colimits that commute with finite limits.

###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[topos]] and $F: C \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ is flat, then the functor $(- \otimes F) : [C^op,Set] \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ (the [[Yoneda extension]] of $F$, i.e. the left [[Kan extension]] of $F$ along the [[Yoneda embedding]]) preserves all finite limits (and now all finite limits exist).

=--

For $\mathcal{E} = $ [[Set]] this is prop. 6.1.3 in ([Borceux](#Borceux)).


A similar statement holds when $C$ is a [[site]] and we extend a co[[continuous functor]] $F$ to $Sh(C)$.  But a cocontinuous functor from $Sh(C)$ preserving finite limits is (almost) the same thing as (the [[inverse image]] part of) a [[geometric morphism]].  So cocontinuous flat functors out of a site $C$ characterise (almost) geometric morphisms into $Sh(C)$.  This can be very useful when a [[Grothendieck topos]] has a presentation by a particularly simple site.

## Examples

* Morphisms of [[site]]s are given by flat functors.
