## Idea

A _locally strongly finitely presentable category_ is like a [[locally finitely presentable category]], but where the class of [[filtered colimits]] (respectively the class of [[finite limits]]) is replaced by the class of [[sifted colimits]] (respectively the class of [[finite products]]).
