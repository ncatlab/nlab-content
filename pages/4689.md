## Idea

A theory of _quantum gravity_ is supposed to be a [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) -- or something similar -- that corresponds to the [[classical field theory]] of [[gravity]], possibly by [[quantization]].

There are various proposals for what quantum gravity might be, but a comprehensive theory is missing to date. This is in stark contrast to the situation for the other fundamental [[force]]s of the [[standard model of particle physics]]: these are [[Yang-Mills field]]s, whose nature as QFTs is, while subtle, well understood. Indeed, the theoretical and experimental sucess of [[Yang-Mills theory]] is the main reason for the belief that QFT is the right framework for fundamental physics, and that also the field of gravity must have a description in this form. 

Indeed, a model of fundamental physics where Yang-Mills fields are quantized but gravity is not is incomplete and arguably even inconsistent. Central motivating examples for this come from [[black hole]]-physics:

1. The study of quantum fields on the classical gravitational background of a [[black hole]] [[spacetime]] suggest that in a full theory of quantum gravity black holes could be shown to emit radiation and to eventually even decay in some way or other. This expected decay process cannot be described without a theory of quantum gravity.

1. Related to black hole radiation is a whole series of observations in classical [[general relativity]] that seem to indicate that black holes need to be thought of as systems possessing physical microstates with an [[entropy]] that cannot be accounted for by classical general relativity. This has led to the expectation that these microstates are states in quantum theory of gravity and that their understanding is necessary for understanding the physics of black holes.

1. More generally, appearances of unphysical singularities in [[general relativity]], such as in [[black hole]]s or [[cosmology|cosmological]] singularities such as the [[big bang]], have been argued to be artefacts of a non-quantum description of gravity. Various toy models of quantum gravity have been proposed where notably the big-bang singularity is just a classical approximation to a non-singular and well-defined quantum dynamics.

An evident definition of quantum gravity would seem to simply be the [[quantization]] of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] by the rules [[perturbation theory]] and [[renormalization]]. This straightforward approach however fails, as it can be demonstrated that this [[action functional]] is not [[renormalization|renormalizable]]. 

More recently it has been argued that there is evidence that the EH-action has a nontrivial [[UV-fixed point]] after all. If true this would mean that a quantization of gravity in standard QFT is possible.

Another possibility is that this is only an apparent problem, and that standard gravity is nothing but an [[effective quantum field theory]]. (See there for references on gravity).

But most approaches to the problem have taken the non-renormalizability of classical gravity to be an indication that the standard concepts of QFT might need refinement in order to include gravity. 

A common idea is that the assumption that the space of configurations in gravity is really that of smooth [[spacetime]]s, i.e. of [[smooth manifold]]s, is wrong. A plethora of variants of the notion of smooth manifold have been proposed as ingredients for a theory of quantum gravity. Notably concepts in [[noncommutative geometry]]. For instance [[Alain Connes]]'s [[spectral action]] generalizes the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional from [[Riemannian manifold]]s to [[spectral triple]]s. However, none of the modifications of the spaces of configuratations of gravity proposed so far have been shown to support action functionals that can actually be quantized, in one sense or another.

Accordingly there are suggestions to modify instead the principles of perturbative quantum field theory. In [[string theory]] the fundamental assumption is that the Feynman perturbation series over 1-dimensional graphs of traditional perturbative QFT is to be refined by a similar series over 2-dimensional surfaces. It has been shown that this _string perturbation series_ needs no renormalization and that it does describe Yang-Mills fields and a gravitational field. This led to huge hopes and large activity in the study of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity. But various central questions remain open and the state of the theory remains somewhat inconclusive.

While perturbative string theory did demonstrate that there is a variant of the perturbation series for gravity which is renormalized, it can, by definition of perturbation theory, be just an approximation to a more fundamental non-perturbatively defined theory. Various candidates for the non-perturbative theory to which the string perturbation series might be an approximation have been proposed. One that enjoyed a large popularity in the 1990s was called _matrix mechanics_ but the high hopes connected with it were supported mostly by toy example computations. More recently the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] is widely thought of as providing a non-perturbative definition of string theory and of quantum gravity. This correspondence asserts that observables of a string theory on an asymptotically [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] may be matched equivalently to certain observables in an auxiliary super [[Yang-Mills theory]]. If true, this would allow to take the well understood non-perturbative definition of Yang-Mills theory and deduce from it a theory of quantum gravity. 

Still another suggestion has been that ordinary quantum field theory might be seen to apply to the ordinary configuration space and action functional of general relativity, if only a suitably adapted parameterization of the configuration space is chosen. Notably one observes that [[Riemannian manifold]]s may be encoded in terms of [[connection on a bundle|connections on the tangent bundle]] -- the [[Levi-Civita connection]] -- this being manifestly analogous to the nature of the fields in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. (See [[first-order formulation of gravity]]).

It has been suggested that therefore quantum gravity may have a description in terms of the [[holonomy]]-observables of these connections,  their [[parallel transport]] around loops. Research in this direction has therefore become known as _loop quantum gravity_ . However, little progress has been made in understanding the configuration space of smooth connections in terms of loop observables. In most of the LQG-literature instead it is assumed from the outset that it makes sense to pass to _generalized connections_ : while a smooth connection is the same as a smooth [[parallel transport]]-[[functor]] on the [[path groupoid]] $\mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G$, the "generalized connections" in this context are taken to be non-smooth and non-continuous such functors on sub-categories of paths. It is is not clear how this configuration space relates to that of ordinary gravity.

A plethora of further suggestions has developed out of this, which in the literature often still go under the name "LQG", even though they may abandon the description of configuration spaces of metrics in terms of loop observables. There is for instance the approach of _spin foams_ or _dynamical triangulations_ , and that of _[[causet]]s_ , to name just a few.

The problem with discriminating between all these proposals is the combination of two problems.

1. There exist insufficient theoretical tools for analyzing in detail the consequences of the various proposals.

1. There are few to no experiments available that would be able to observe the phenomena that a theory of quantum gravity is supposed to describe.

As a result, the field of fundamental physics today finds itself in a somewhat awkward position where the need for theoretical progress concerning quantum gravity for conceptual reasons is widely appreciated, but where disagreements about the viability of various proposals finds no conclusive resolution and divides the community.
