## Idea 

A **partial recursive function** is a [[partial function]] which can be defined by an [[algorithm]] or computer [[program]] (e.g., a [[Turing machine]]), taking finitely many [[natural numbers]] as inputs, and which on input may run forever, but otherwise eventually halts and returns a natural number as output. 

This idea as described is vague until it is circumscribed by a specific notion of computer program (Turing machines, register machines, abaci, etc.). There is a standard article of faith called the "Church--Turing thesis", identifying functions on natural numbers that are algorithmically computable with those that are computable using a Turing machine (or some variant class of machines that is Turing-complete). 

A purely mathematical definition of the intended class of functions is given below.

###### Definition 
A _partial recursive function_ is a [[partial function]] from $\mathbb{N}^k$ to $\mathbb{N}$ (where $\mathbb{N}$ is the [[set]] of [[natural numbers]] and $k \geq 0$ is finite) that belongs to the smallest [[class]] $\mathcal{C}$ of partial functions that 

* includes all [[constant functions]] $1 \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* includes all [[projection]] maps $\pi_i: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$, $i = 1, \ldots, k$; 

* includes the successor function $s: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* is closed under [[composition]]: if $f_1: \mathbb{N}^{k_1} \to \mathbb{N}, \ldots, f_n: \mathbb{N}^{k_n} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $g: \mathbb{N}^n \to \mathbb{N}$ belong to $\mathcal{C}$, then so does $g \circ (f_1, \ldots, f_n): \mathbb{N}^{k_1 + \ldots + k_n} \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* is closed under primitive [[recursion]]: if $g: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$ and $h: \mathbb{N}^{k+2} \to \mathbb{N}$ belong to $\mathcal{C}$, then the function $f: \mathbb{N}^{k+1} \to \mathbb{N}$ defined recursively by the equations (for $y \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{N}^k$) 
$$f(0, \mathbf{x}) = g(\mathbf{x})$$ 
$$\,$$
$$f(y+1, \mathbf{x}) = h(y, f(y, \mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x})$$ 
also belongs to $\mathcal{C}$; 

* is closed under minimization: given any _[[total function|total]]_ function $f: \mathbb{N}^{k+1} \to \mathbb{N}$ belonging to $\mathcal{C}$, the partial function $g: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$, defined by $g(\mathbf{x}) = c$ iff $f(c, \mathbf{x}) = 0$ and $f(d, \mathbf{x}) \gt 0$ whenever $0 \leq d \leq c-1$, also belongs to $\mathcal{C}$.

###### Definition 
A _primitive recursive function_ is a function that belongs to the smallest class of functions of the form $\mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$ that contains constants, projection maps, the successor map, is closed under composition, and is closed under primitive recursion. 
=-- 

Clearly the primitive recursive functions are a subclass of partial recursive functions. Notice that primitive recursive functions are not merely partial functions, but actual (*total*) functions. 

Both the class of partial recursive functions and the class of primitive recursive functions yield [[Lawvere theories]], where a morphism $k \to 1$ of the Lawvere theory is a function $\mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$ belonging to the class.

###### Definition 
A _recursive relation_ (or what is more usual nowadays, a *computable relation*) is a subset of $\mathbb{N}^k$ whose characteristic function $\chi: \mathbb{N}^k \to \{0, 1\}$ is recursive. Similarly, a primitive recursive relation is a relation whose characteristic function is primitive recursive. 
=-- 


## Properties

We may build up a stock of functions and relations that are primitive recursive as follows. (All closure properties mentioned will clearly also apply to partial recursive functions and relations.) 

1. Addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on $\mathbb{N}$. The factorial function $n \mapsto n!$ is primitive recursive. Binomial coefficients. 

1. The predecessor function $Pred: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, defined by the recursion $Pred(0) = 0$, $Pred(n+1) = n$. 

1. *Truncated subtraction*, where $x \stackrel{\cdot}{-} y = x - y$ if $x \geq y$, else $0$, is primitive recursive. It is defined by the recursion $x \stackrel{\cdot}{-} 0 = x$, $x \stackrel{\cdot}{-} (y+1) = Pred(x \stackrel{\cdot}{-} y)$. 

1. The distance function ${|x-y|} = (x \stackrel{\cdot}{-} y) + (y \stackrel{\cdot}{-} x)$. The function $\alpha(x) = 1 \stackrel{\cdot}{-} x$; this is the characteristic function of the unary relation or predicate "equals zero". So "equals zero" is a computable relation. So is "doesn't equal zero", since this has characteristic function $\alpha(\alpha(x))$. 

1. Therefore the equality relation ${|x-y|} = 0$ is a computable relation. So is $x \lt y$, being the relation "$y \stackrel{\cdot}{-} x$ doesn't equal zero". 

1. Similarly, if $R$ is a primitive recursive relation (so that its characteristic function $\chi_R$ is primitive recursive), then so is its negation $\neg R$, since $\chi_{\neg R} = \alpha(\chi_R)$. If $P$, $Q$ are primitive recursive relations, so is $P \wedge Q$, since $\chi_{P \wedge Q} = \chi_P \cdot \chi_Q$. Hence Boolean combinations of primitive recursive relations are primitive recursive. 

1. If $f(x, y, \mathbf{z})$ is primitive recursive, so is 
$$g(y, \mathbf{z}) \coloneqq \sum_{x=0}^{y-1} f(x, y, \mathbf{z})$$ 
and similarly with the sum replaced by a product. It follows that primitive recursive predicates are closed under _bounded quantification_; e.g., if $R(x, y, \mathbf{z})$ is primitive recursive, then so is 
$$Q(y, \mathbf{z}) = \forall_{0 \leq x \lt y} R(x, y, \mathbf{z}) \coloneqq \bigwedge_{x=0}^{y-1} R(x, y, \mathbf{z})$$ 
since $\chi_Q(y, \mathbf{z}) = \prod_{x=0}^{y-1} \chi_R(x, y, \mathbf{z})$. 

1. (Bounded least number operator) If $R(x, y, \mathbf{z})$ is a primitive recursive relation, then the function $f(y, \mathbf{z})$ defined to be "least $x$ such that $R(x, y, \mathbf{z})$ if such $x$ exists, else $y$" is primitive recursive. Indeed, 
$$f(y, \mathbf{z}) = [\sum_{x=0}^{y-1} (x \cdot \chi_R(x, y, \mathbf{z}) \cdot (\prod_{w=0}^{x-1} \chi_{\neg R}(w, y, \mathbf{z}))] + y \cdot \prod_{x=0}^{y-1} \chi_{\neg R}(x, y, \mathbf{z}).$$  


(To be continued.) 

There exist primitive recursive mutually inverse [[bijections]] between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^k$ for any $k \gt 0$; since partial/primitive recursive functions are closed under composition, it is sufficient (and sometimes convenient) to consider only partial/primitive recursive functions on $\mathbb{N}$ itself.  (The exception is the case $k = 0$, but this is trivial, since every partial function $\mathbb{N} \to 1$ or $1 \to \mathbb{N}$ is recursive.) 

For instance, the map $\mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{N}$ defined by (to be continued). 


## The Ackermann function 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
For each $n$, we define a function $A_n: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by 

* $A_0(m) = 2 m$; 

* $A_{n+1}(m) = (A_n)^m(1)$ 

where $f^m$ denotes the composition of $m$ copies of $f$. The **Ackermann function** $A: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is defined by $A(m) = A_m(m)$. 
=-- 

We show that while each $A_n$ is primitive recursive, the function $A$ grows faster than any primitive recursive function on $\mathbb{N}$, hence is not itself primitive recursive. It does however belong to the class of partial recursive functions. (The key is that while 

It is easy to show that $A_0$ is primitive recursive. Supposing that $A_n$ is primitive recursive, we can show that $A_{n+1}$ is primitive recursive: first $A_{n+1}(0) = 1$, and then $A_{n+1}(m+1) = A_n (A_{n+1}(m))$. Thus, letting $g$ be the constant or 0-ary function with value $1$, and letting $h$ be the binary function $A_n \circ \pi_2: \mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{N}$ which is primitive recursive by supposition, $A_{n+1}$ is the function $f$ asserted to exist in the primitive recursion axiom. 

By induction one may easily show $A_n(1) = 2$ for all $n$ and $A_n(2) = 4$ for all $n$. We have $A_{n+1}(3) = A_n(A_n(A_n(1))) = A_n(A_n(2)) = A_n(4)$ for all $n$. The function $A_1$ gives powers of $2$, the function $A_2$ gives tetrations of $2$, and it gets crazy from there. 

Some routine inductions establish the following facts: 

1. For all $n$, the function $A_n$ is strictly increasing, and with the sole exception of $A_0(0) = 0$, we have $m \lt A_n(m)$ for all $m$, i.e. $A_n$ is strictly inflationary in arguments $m \gt 0$.
