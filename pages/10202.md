## Idea 

A **partial recursive function** is a [[partial function]] which can be defined by an [[algorithm]] or computer [[program]] (e.g., a [[Turing machine]]), taking finitely many [[natural numbers]] as inputs, and which on input may run forever, but otherwise eventually halts and returns a natural number as output. 

This idea as described is vague until it is circumscribed by a specific notion of computer program (Turing machines, register machines, abaci, etc.). There is a standard article of faith called the "Church--Turing thesis", identifying functions on natural numbers that are algorithmically computable with those that are computable using a Turing machine (or some variant class of machines that is Turing-complete). 

A purely mathematical definition of the intended class of functions is given below.

###### Definition 
A _partial recursive function_ is a [[partial function]] from $\mathbb{N}^k$ to $\mathbb{N}$ (where $\mathbb{N}$ is the [[set]] of [[natural numbers]] and $k \geq 0$ is finite) that belongs to the smallest [[class]] $\mathcal{C}$ of partial functions that 

* includes all [[constant functions]] $1 \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* includes all [[projection]] maps $\pi_i: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$, $i = 1, \ldots, k$; 

* includes the successor function $s: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* is closed under [[composition]]: if $f_1: \mathbb{N}^{k_1} \to \mathbb{N}, \ldots, f_n: \mathbb{N}^{k_n} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $g: \mathbb{N}^n \to \mathbb{N}$ belong to $\mathcal{C}$, then so does $g \circ (f_1, \ldots, f_n): \mathbb{N}^{k_1 + \ldots + k_n} \to \mathbb{N}$; 

* is closed under primitive [[recursion]]: if $g: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$ and $h: \mathbb{N}^{k+2} \to \mathbb{N}$ belong to $\mathcal{C}$, then the function $f: \mathbb{N}^{k+1} \to \mathbb{N}$ defined recursively by the equations (for $y \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{N}^k$) 
$$f(0, \mathbf{x}) = g(\mathbf{x})$$ 
$$\,$$
$$f(y+1, \mathbf{x}) = h(y, f(y, \mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x})$$ 
also belongs to $\mathcal{C}$; 

* is closed under minimization: given any _[[total function|total]]_ function $f: \mathbb{N}^{k+1} \to \mathbb{N}$ belonging to $\mathcal{C}$, the partial function $g: \mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$, defined by $g(\mathbf{x}) = c$ iff $f(c, \mathbf{x}) = 0$ and $f(d, \mathbf{x}) \gt 0$ whenever $0 \leq d \leq c-1$, also belongs to $\mathcal{C}$.

## Properties

There exist recursive [[bijections]] between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^k$ for any $k \gt 0$; since partial recursive functions are closed under composition, it is sufficient (and sometimes convenient) to consider only partial recursive functions on $\mathbb{N}$ itself.  (The exception is the case $k = 0$, but this is trivial, since every partial function $\mathbb{N} \to 1$ or $1 \to \mathbb{N}$ is recursive.)
