## Idea

A generalization of the notion of [[Calabi-Yau manifold]] in the context of [[generalized complex geometry]].

## Definition

### In terms of $G$-structure
 {#InTermsOfGStructure}

For $X$ a $2n$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]], a _[[generalized complex geometry|generalized complex structure]]_ on $X$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[generalized tangent bundle]] $T X \oplus T^* X$ along the inclusion

$$
  U(n,n) \hookrightarrow O(2n,2n)
$$

into the [[Narain group]]. 

Recall that for $X$ an ordinary [[compact topological space|compact]] [[complex manifold]] of real [[dimension]] $2n$, a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]] structure on $X$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] along the inclusion $SU(n) \hookrightarrow U(n)$ of the [[special unitary group]] into the [[unitary group]].

A **generalized Calabi-Yau structure** on a generalized complex manifold $X$ is a further [[reduction of the structure group]] along

$$
  SU(n,n) \hookrightarrow U(n,n) \hookrightarrow O(2n,2n)
  \,.
$$
