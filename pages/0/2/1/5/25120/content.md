## Idea

_Higher-order abstract-syntax_, often abbreviated as _HOAS_, is an approach to formalizing languages supporting forms of [[name binding]] such as function parameters or quantifiers by using the meta-language [[function space]] rather than a more syntactic notion of bound variable.

## Related Concepts

* HOAS is used extensively in [[logical frameworks]]

* [[synthetic Tait computability]]
