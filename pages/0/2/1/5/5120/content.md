## Idea

Point of a spectrum of an operator algebra should be thought as a common generalized eigenvalue of the corresponding family of operators. Thus the spectra of algebras, presenting the "points" of underlying space and spectra 
of families of operators have closely related origin in main examples. 

## Overview

__Spectral theory__ concerns generalizations of the theory of spectrum of linear operator on finite-dimensional complex vector space. Most of such generalizations occur in functional analysis (spectral theory of bounded Hermitean operator on a Hilbert space, spectral theory of unbounded operators, spectral theory of families of operators, spectral theory of complex Banach algebras). Spectral theory is in the basis of Gel'fand-Neimark theorem. The points of the Gel'fand spectrum of a commutative $C^*$-algebra have spectral origin in the sense of [[functional analysis]]; the structure of an operator algebra reflects this -- the characters encode related information, and in more general cases, the ideal and even module structure. In noncommutative algebraic geometry, one considers the spectra of module categories, spectra of rings and so on; all being related in general spectral theory.

While spectra generalize eigenvalues, the generalized eigenmodes are studied in harmonic analysis, included noncommutative where irreducible representations generalize characters. It is traditional that by spectral theory in functional setup one subsumes only those issues which are closelt related to operator theoretic holomorphic calculus, but not other harmonic aspects.
