Bi-terminal objects are the [[bicategory|bicategorical]] analogues of [[terminal object|terminal objects]] in categories.

## Definition

In a bicategory $A$, an object $L \in A$ is **bi-terminal** (or **biterminal**) when for all $X \in A$, there is an equivalence of categories between $A(X,L)$ and the category with a single object and single morphism $\mathbb{1}$.
