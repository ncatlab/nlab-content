There are different notions in mathematics called _basis_.  Generally speaking, these fall into two classes:

*  situations where the term _[[base]]_ is also used:
   *  [[topological base]]
   *  [[basis for a Grothendieck topology]],
   *  etc ...;

*  the generating [[set]] of a [[free object]]:
   *  [[basis of a free module]],
   *  [[basis in functional analysis]]
   *  etc ....

Note that the plurals of 'basis' and 'base' are both spelt 'bases' (although their pronunciations differ).

Suggestions:

*  Use the term 'base' for the former, reserving 'basis' only for the latter.
*  Never link to 'bases' in the wiki, since we don\'t know how to redirect it.
