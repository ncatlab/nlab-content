## Idea

The __$n$-dimensional cube__, or simply __$n$-cube__, is a generalisation of the ordinary cube (or $3$-cube) to arbitrary dimensions.  It comes in many guises.


## As a cubical set

The standard cubical $n$-cube is the [[cubical set]] represented (as a [[presheaf]]) by the object $[n]$ in the [[cube category]].


## As a topological space

The standard topological $n$-cube is the space $[0,1]^n$, where $[0,1]$ is the [[unit interval]].  The collection of topological cubes forms a topological [[cocubical set]].
