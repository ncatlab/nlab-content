A [[functor]] $U:D\to C$ is **monadic** if it has a [[left adjoint]] $F:C\to D$ and the canonical comparison functor from $D$ to the category $C^{U F}$ of algebras for the [[monad]] $U \circ F$ is an [[equivalence of categories]].  In other words, up to equivalence, monadic functors are precisely the [[forgetful functor]]s defined on categories of algebras for monads.

The various forms of the [[monadicity theorem]] give sufficient, and sometimes necessary, conditions for a given functor to be monadic.
