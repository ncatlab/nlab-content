## Idea

A [[functor]] $U \,\colon\, D\to C$ is _monadic_ iff it has a [[left adjoint]] $F \,\colon\, C\to D$ and the [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] $F\dashv U$ "comes from: the induced [[monad]] on $C$" -- that is, $U$ _monadic_ iff $F\dashv U$ is a [[monadic adjunction]].

In this situation $U$ "looks like" the [[forgetful functor]] from the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of the monad $(U\circ F, \eta, U\epsilon_F)$ on $C$, and has 'nice properties' similar to these [[forgetful functors]].

\begin{tikzcd}
  \mathcal{C}
  \ar[
    from=r,
    "{ U }"{description}
  ]
  \ar[
    r,
    shift left=16pt,
    "{ F }"
  ]
  \ar[
    r,
    shift left=9.5pt,
    phantom,
    "{ \scalebox{.62}{$\bot$} }"
  ]
  &
  \mathcal{D}
  \simeq
  \mathrm{EM}(\mathrm{ U \circ F })
\end{tikzcd}


The *[[monadicity theorem]]* characterizes monadic functors and makes these 'nice properties' precise.

Monadic functors are sometimes called *functors of effective descent type*. See the page on *[[monadic descent]]* for more on this aspect.


## Definition

Given a [[adjoint pair|pair]] of [[adjoint functors]] $F \colon C \to D :U$, $F \dashv U$, with [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] $\eta: Id_C \to U \circ F$ and counit $\epsilon: F \circ U \to Id_D$, one constructs a [[monad]] $\mathbf{T}=(T,\mu,\eta)$ setting $T = U \circ F: C \to C$, $\mu = U \epsilon F: T T = U F U F \to U F = T$. 

Consider the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] $C^{\mathbf{T}}$ of $T$-algebras ($T$-modules) in $C$. Clearly $U (\epsilon_M): T U M = U F U M \to U M$ is a $T$-action. In fact there is a canonical *[[comparison functor]]* $K^{\mathbf{T}} \colon D \to C^{\mathbf{T}}$ given on objects by $K(M) \coloneqq \big(U M, U (\epsilon_M) \big)$.  We then say that we have a (resp. strictly) [[monadic adjunction]] iff $K$ is an equivalence (resp. isomorphism) of categories.

\begin{definition}\label{MonadicFunctor}
**(monadic functor)**
\linebreak
A [[functor]] $U \colon D \to C$ is *monadic* (resp. *strictly monadic*) if it has a [[left adjoint]] $F \colon C\to D$ and the comparison functor $K^{\mathbf{T}}: D \to C^{\mathbf{T}}$ is an [[equivalence of categories]] (resp. an [[isomorphism]] of [[strict categories]]).  
\end{definition}

In other words, up to equivalence, monadic functors are precisely the [[forgetful functors]] defined on [[Eilenberg-Moore categories]] for monads, and strictly monadic functors are the same as these forgetful functors up to isomorphism. 

* If the comparison functor is only [[fully faithful]], a functor is sometimes called *[[premonadic functor|premonadic]]* or said to be *of [[descent type]]*.


\begin{definition}
A *category* $D$ is called *monadic* over a category $C$ if there is any functor $U \colon D \to C$ which is monadic (Def. \ref{MonadicFunctor}).
\end{definition}



## Properties

### Basic properties

\begin{proposition}
A monadic functor is *strictly monadic* if and only if it is also an [[amnestic functor|amnestic]] [[isofibration]].
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Clearly, a strictly monadic functor is an amnestic isofibration; and if a monadic functor $U$ is amnestic, then the comparison functor $K$ is also amnestic, and if $U$ is a monadic isofibration, so is $K$; therefore in this case $K$ must be an isomorphism of categories. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Beware that the class of monadic functors is *not* closed under [[composition]]. 

For a specific [[counter-example]]: the category of [[reflexive graph|reflexive quivers]] is monadic over $Set$ via the functor $RefGph \to Set$ sending a graph to its set of edges, and the category of categories is monadic over reflexive graphs via the forgetful functor $Cat \to RefGph$, but $Cat$ is not monadic over $Set$ (via any functor whatsoever, since such categories are [[regular categories]] but $Cat$ is not).

This is an instance of a general phenomenon: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a reflective subcategory of a presheaf category $\widehat{A}$ (e.g. every [[locally presentable category]] is of this form). Then the adjunction between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\widehat{A}$ is monadic, and the adjunction between $\widehat{A}$ and $\mathrm{Set}^{\mathrm{Ob} A}$ is also monadic. But the composite adjunction between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathrm{Set}^{\mathrm{Ob} A}$ is often not monadic. For instance, if it is monadic, then $\mathcal{C}$ must be a [[Barr-exact category]].
\end{remark}

### Monadicity theorem

Various versions of Beck's [[monadicity theorem]] (also: "tripleability theorem" in older literature) give sufficient, and sometimes necessary, conditions for a given functor to be monadic. There are also dual, [[comonadic functor|comonadic versions]].
