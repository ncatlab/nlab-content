## Idea

Generally, given a ([[complex numbers|complex]]) [[linear operator]] on a [[separable Hilbert space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] with [[real numbers|real]] [[operator spectrum]], then a *spectral gap* is any [[interval]] $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ not intersecting the spectrum.

In [[quantum physics]] this is often considered for the [[Hamiltonian operator]] of a [[quantum system]], whence one also speaks of an "energy gap". 

Moreover, often the term is by default understood as referring to a gap above the [[ground state]], hence such that the only energy [[eigenvalue]] smaller than all $E \in I$ is that of the ground state (typically taken to be [[zero]]).
