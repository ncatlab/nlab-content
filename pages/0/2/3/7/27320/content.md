## Idea

### Generally

Generally, given a ([[complex numbers|complex]]) [[linear operator]] on a [[separable Hilbert space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] with [[real numbers|real]] [[operator spectrum]], then a *spectral gap* is any [[interval]] $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ not intersecting the spectrum.

### In quantum physics

In [[quantum physics]] this is often considered for the [[Hamiltonian operator]] of a [[quantum system]], whence one also speaks of an "energy gap". 

Moreover, often the term is by default understood as referring to a gap above the [[ground state]], hence such that the only energy [[eigenvalue]] smaller than all $E \in I$ is that of the ground state (typically taken to be [[zero]]).

While spectral gaps are ubiquituous in single-atom quantum systems (cf. the famous discrete energy levels of the [[hydrogen atom]]) they tend to disappear in the [[thermodynamic limit]] when [[quantum many-body physics|many atoms]] are brought close together, whereby their energy levels fuse into continuous [[energy bands]].

For this reason, in [[condensed matter theory]] "[[gapped Hamiltonians]]" are the remarkable exception, not the rule (cf. also *[[topological phases of matter]]*).
