# The idea #

A category consists of a collection of arrows each having a single object as source or input, and a single object as target or output, together with laws for composition and identity obeying associativity and identity axioms. A multicategory is like a category, except that one allows multiple inputs and a single output. 

Thus a multicategory $C$ consists of 

* A collection of _objects_, $C_0$, 

* A collection of _multimorphisms_, $C_1$. 

* A source map $s: C_1 \to (C_0)*$ to the collection of finite, possibly empty lists of objects (thus $(C_0)*$ is the free monoid generated by $C_0$), and a target map $t: C_1 \to C_0$. We write $f: c_1, \ldots, c_n \to c$ to indicate the source and target of a multimorphism $f$. 

* Identity and composition laws. The identity law is a map $1_{-}: C_0 \to C_1$ where $1_c: c \to c$. The composition law assigns, to each $f: c_1, \ldots, c_n \to c$ together with an $n$-tuple $\langle f_i: \vec{c}_i \to c_i: i = 1, \ldots, n \rangle$, a composite 
$$f \circ (f_1, \ldots, f_n): \vec{c}_1, \ldots, \vec{c}_n \to c$$ 
where the source is obtained by concatenating lists in the evident way. 

These operations are subject to associativity and identity axioms which the reader can probably figure out, but see for example Tom Leinster's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0305049">book</a>, page 35 ff., for details. 

## Further details and generalizations ## 

An efficient abstract method for defining multicategories and related structures is through the formalism of [[cartesian monads]]. For ordinary categories, one uses the identity monad on $Set$; for ordinary multicategories, one uses the free monoid monad $(-)*: Set \to Set$. There is a very general notion of $T$-multicategory, where $T$ is a cartesian monad on a category with finite limits, which we now explain. 

* A $T$-span is a diagram 
$$T X \stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow} E \stackrel{p_2}{\to} Y$$
