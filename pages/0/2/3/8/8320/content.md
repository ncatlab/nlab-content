* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

In [[logic]], the _contraction rule_ states that any valid [[deduction]] that uses a [[premise]] more than once remains valid using that premise only once.  Along with the [[weakening rule]] and the [[exchange rule]], it is one of the most commonly adopted [[structural rules]].

The contraction rule is not used in all [[logical frameworks]]. For instance in [[linear logic]] it is discarded.


## Statements

Exactly how this looks depends on the [[logic]] used.

...

## Semantics

This rule corresponds to having [[monoidal category with diagonals|diagonals for the monoidal structure]] corresponding to the logical binary operator at hand.
