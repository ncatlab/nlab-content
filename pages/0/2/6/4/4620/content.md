## Idea

In [[logic and foundations]], a __principle of omniscience__ is any principle of [[classical mathematics]] that is not valid in [[constructive mathematics]].  The idea behind the name (which is due to [Bishop (1967)](#Bishop67)) is that, if we attempt to extend the [[computation|computational]] interpretation of constructive mathematics to incorporate one of these principles, we would have to know something that we cannot compute.  The main example is the law of [[excluded middle]] ($EM$); to apply $p \vee \neg{p}$ computationally, we must know which of these [[disjunction|disjuncts]] hold; to apply this in all situations, we would have to know everything (hence 'omniscience').

Bishop\'s principles of omniscience (stated below) may be seen as principles that extend classical logic from [[predicates]] (where $EM$ may happen to be valid, even constructively, for certain predicates) to their [[quantifications]] over infinite domains (where $EM$ is typically not constructively valid).


## Definition

### The limited principle of omniscience

The __limited principle of omniscience__ ($LPO$) states that the [[existential quantification]] of any [[decidable proposition]] is again decidable.  That is,
$$ (\forall x, P(x) \vee \neg{P(x)}) \Rightarrow (\exists x, P(x)) \vee \neg(\exists x, P(x)) ,$$
or equivalently
$$ (\forall x, P(x) \vee \neg{P(x)}) \Rightarrow (\exists x, P(x)) \vee (\forall x, \neg{P(x)}) .$$


We have not stated the domain of quantification of the variable $x$.  If you take it to be the [[subsingleton]] corresponding to a given [[truth value]] and apply this principle to the constantly [[true]] proposition, then $EM$ follows; conversely, $EM$ implies $LPO$ (over any domain).  However, Bishop\'s $LPO$ takes the domain to be the set of [[natural numbers]], giving a weaker principle than $EM$.  (It appears that a [[realizability topos]] based on infinite-time [[Turing machine]]s validates $LPO$ but not $EM$; see [Bauer (2011)](#Bauer11).)  Note that propositions of the form $\exists x, P(x)$ when $P$ is decidable are the [[open truth values]] in the [[Rosolini dominance]].

We can also state the principle set-theoretically, with explicit reference to the domain of quantification.  Given a [[set]] $A$, the __limited principle of omniscience for $A$__ ($LPO_A$) states that, given any [[function]] $f$ from $A$ to the [[boolean domain]] $\{0,1\}$, either $f$ is the [[constant map]] to $0$ or $1$ belongs to the [[image]] of $f$.  Then Bishop\'s $LPO$ is $LPO_{\mathbb{N}}$, which applies to any [[infinite sequence]] of [[bits]].

While $LPO$ for $\mathbb{N}$ is a classic example of the difference between constructive and classical mathematics, $LPO$ holds for the set $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ of [[extended natural number]]s; this is related to the fact that $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ may constructively be given a [[compact space|compact]] topology.  See [Escard&#243; (2011)](#Escardo11) for this and much more.

### The weak limited principle of omniscience

The __weak limited principle of omniscience__ ($WLPO$) states that the [[universal quantification]] of any [[decidable proposition]] is again decidable. That is,
$$(\forall x, P(x) \vee \neg{P(x)}) \Rightarrow (\forall x, P(x)) \vee \neg(\forall x, P(x)).$$

### The lesser limited principle of omniscience

The __lesser limited principle of omniscience__ ($LLPO$) states that, if the existential quantification of the [[conjunction]] of two [[decidable propositions]] is false, then one of their separate existential quantifications is false.  That is,
$$ (\forall x, P(x) \vee \neg{P(x)}) \Rightarrow (\forall y, Q(y) \vee \neg{Q(y)}) \Rightarrow \neg(\exists x, P(x) \wedge \exists y, Q(y)) \Rightarrow \neg(\exists x, P(x)) \vee \neg(\exists y, Q(y)) ,$$
or equivalently
$$ (\forall x, P(x) \vee \neg{P(x)}) \Rightarrow (\forall y, Q(y) \vee \neg{Q(y)}) \Rightarrow \neg(\exists x, P(x) \wedge \exists y, Q(y)) \Rightarrow (\forall x, \neg{P(x)}) \vee (\forall y, \neg{Q(y)}) .$$

If, as before, you take the domains of quantification to be subsingletons, you get [[de Morgan's law]] $\neg(p \wedge q) \Rightarrow \neg{p} \vee \neg{q}$ ($DM$), which is weaker than $EM$; conversely, $DM$ implies $LLPO$ (over any domain). Again, Bishop\'s $LLPO$ takes the domain to be $\mathbb{N}$, giving a principle weaker than $DM$ (and also weaker than $LPO_{\mathbb{N}}$). 

Stated set-theoretically, the __lesser limited principle of omniscience for $A$__ ($LLPO_A$) states that, given functions $f, g\colon A \to \{0,1\}$, if $1 \notin \im f \cap \im g$, then $1 \notin \im f$ or $1 \notin \im g$.  So Bishop\'s $LLPO$ is $LLPO_{\mathbb{N}}$.

### Relation between the principles of omniscience

We have the following relations between the three principles of omniscience:

* $WLPO$ follows from $LPO$, but not conversely. If $P(x)$ is a decidable proposition, then so is $\neg{P(x)}$, and so $LPO$ gives
$$(\exists x, \neg{P(x)}) \vee (\forall x, \neg{\neg{P(x)}}), $$
which implies
$$\neg(\forall x, P(x)) \vee (\forall x, P(x))$$
as $P$ is decidable.

* $LLPO$ follows from $LPO$, but not conversely. 

## Analytic versions {#analytic}

Bishop introduced the above principles of omniscience to show that certain results in pointwise [[analysis]] could not be constructive, by showing that these results implied a principle of omniscience.  The principles of omniscience that appear directly in analysis are these:

*  The __analytic LPO__ states that the usual [[apartness relation]] on the set $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]] is [[decidable relation|decidable]] ($x \neq y$ or $x = y$), or equivalently __[[trichotomy]]__ for the real numbers ($x \lt y$ or $x = y$ or $x \gt y$), or equivalently, that the real numbers form a [[discrete field]].

* The __analytic WLPO__ states that $\mathbb{R}$ has [[decidable equality]].

*  The __analytic LLPO__ states that the usual order on $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[total order]] ($x \leq y$ or $x \geq y$), which (by analogy with trichotomy) may be called __dichotomy__ for the real numbers.

The analytic principles of omniscience imply the corresponding ones for natural numbers; the converses hold if we assume [[weak countable choice]] (as Bishop did).  In any case, if we use the [[modulated Cantor real numbers]] (sequential real numbers), then the sequential-analytic principles of omniscience are the same as those for natural numbers.

(Note that we need not accept $WCC$ to see that an analytic result implies a principle of omniscience and so cannot be constructively valid.)

## In the internal logic

In [[set theory]], there are actually two different notions of logic: there is the external predicate logic used to define the set theory itself, and there is the internal predicate logic induced by the set operations on [[subsingletons]] and [[injections]]. In particular, 

* An internal *[[proposition]]* is a set $P$ such that for all elements $x \in A$ and $y \in A$, $x = y$. 

* The internal proposition *[[true]]* is a [[singleton]] $\top$. 

* The internal proposition *[[false]]* is the [[empty set]]

* The internal conjunction of two internal propositions $P$ and $Q$ is the [[cartesian product]] $P \times Q$ of $P$ and $Q$. 

* The internal disjunction of two internal propositions $P$ and $Q$ is the [[image]] of the [[uniqueness quantifier|unique]] function $!_{P \uplus Q}:P \uplus Q \to 1$ from the [[disjoint union]] of $P$ and $Q$ to the [[singleton]] $\top$. 

$$P \vee Q = \mathrm{im}(!_{P \uplus Q})$$

* The internal implication of two internal propositions $P$ and $Q$ is the [[function set]] $P \to Q$ between $P$ and $Q$. 

* The internal negation of an internal proposition $P$ is the function set from $P$ to the [[empty set]]

$$\neg P = P \to \emptyset$$

* An internal proposition $P$ is a [[decidable proposition]] if it comes with a function $\chi_P:P \to 2$ from $P$ to the [[boolean domain]] $2$. 

* An *internal predicate* on a set $A$ is a [[set]] $P$ with [[injection]] $i:P \hookrightarrow A$, whose family of propositions indexed by $x \in A$ is represented by the [[preimages]] $i^*(x)$.

* The internal [[existential quantifier]] of an internal predicate $i:P \hookrightarrow A$ is the [[image]] of the [[uniqueness quantifier|unique]] function $!_P:P \to \top$ into the singleton $\top$.

$$\exists_A P = \im(!_P)$$

* The internal [[universal quantifier]] of an internal predicate $i:P \hookrightarrow A$ is the [[dependent product]] of the preimages
 
$$\forall_A P = \{f \in P^A \vert \forall x \in A, f(x) \in i^*(x) \}$$

* An internal predicate $i:P \hookrightarrow A$ is a [[decidable proposition]] if it comes with a function $\chi_P(x):i^*(x) \to 2$ into the [[boolean domain]] for all elements $x \in A$, or equivalently if it comes with a function $\chi_P:A \to 2$ from $A$ to the [[boolean domain]] $2$. 

Then the **internal LPO** for a [[family of sets]] $(A_z)_{z \in I}$ is the LPO for each $A_z$ stated in the internal logic of the set theory:

* For any internal predicate $i:P \hookrightarrow A_z$, if there is a function $\chi_P:A_z \to 2$, then the internal existential quantification of $P$, $\exists_{A_z} P = \im(!_P)$ has a function $(\exists_{A_z} P) \to 2$ into the boolean domain. 

or equivalently, as

* For any function $a:A_z \to 2$, the internal existential quantification of $P = \{x \in A_z \vert a(x) = 1\}$, $\exists_{A_z} P = \im(!_P)$ has a function $(\exists_{A_z} P) \to 2$ into the boolean domain. 

Similarly, the **internal WLPO** for a family of sets $(A_z)_{z \in I}$ is the WLPO for each $A_z$ stated in the internal logic of the set theory:

* For any internal predicate $i:P \hookrightarrow A_z$, if there is a function $\chi_P:A_z \to 2$, then the internal universal quantification of $P$, $\forall_{A_z} P = \{f \in P^{A_z} \vert \forall x \in A_z, f(x) \in i^*(x) \}$ has a function $(\forall_{A_z} P) \to 2$ into the boolean domain. 

or equivalently

* For any function $a:A_z \to 2$, the internal universal quantification of $P = \{x \in A_z \vert a(x) = 1\}$, $\forall_{A_z} P = \{f \in P^{A_z} \vert \forall x \in A_z, f(x) \in i^*(x) \}$ has a function $(\forall_{A_z} P) \to 2$ into the boolean domain. 

And finally, the **internal LLPO** for a family of sets $(A_z)_{z \in I}$ is the LLPO for each $A_z$ stated in the internal logic of the set theory:

* The internal LPO for a family of sets $(A_z)_{z \in I}$ holds only for the internal predicates $i:P \hookrightarrow A_z$ which comes with an internal predicate $j:Q \hookrightarrow A_z$ such that $i^*(x) = \neg j^*(x)$ for all $x \in A_z$. 

In particular, the internal LPO for the family of all [[subsingletons]] is internal excluded middle and the internal LLPO for the family of all [[subsingletons]] is internal [[weak excluded middle]]. Similarly, given a [[universe]] $U$, the internal LPO for the family of all sets in $U$ is excluded middle in $U$, and the internal LLPO for the family of all sets in $U$ is weak excluded middle in $U$. 

The internal versions of the principles of omniscience, like all internal versions of axioms, are weaker than the external version of the principle of omniscience, since while [[bounded separation]] implies that one can convert any external predicate $x \in A \vdash P(x)$ on a set $A$ to an internal predicate $\{x \in A \vert P(x)\} \hookrightarrow A$, it is generally not possible to convert an internal predicate to an external predicate without a reflection rule which turns subsingletons in the set theory into propositions in the external logic. 

## Truncated and untruncated versions in homotopy type theory

In the context of [[homotopy type theory]], the various principles of omniscience can be translated in two ways, by interpreting "or" as [[propositional truncation|propositionally truncated]] ("merely or") or untruncated ("purely or"). The relationships between the truncated and untruncated principles of omniscience are as follows are:

* Truncated LPO and untruncated LPO are equivalent (due to [[Martin Escardo]], see [UFP](#UFP))

* Similarly, truncated WLPO and untruncated WLPO are equivalent.

* Untruncated LLPO is equivalent to WLPO (also due to Martin Escardo).

* In <http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/Lifschitz.pdf> is a model by Michael Rathjen that separates WLPO from LLPO.

## Equivalent statements

There are various other results that are equivalent to the principles of omniscience. Here are a few:

* Let $[0,1]/(0 \sim 1)$ be the [[quotient space|quotient]] of the unit [[interval]] that identifies the endpoints, and let $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ be the [[quotient ring]]; both are classically isomorphic to the [[circle]] $\mathbb{S}^1$. (Constructively, we take $\mathbb{S}^1$ to be $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, although $S^1$ can also be constructed as a [[uniform completion|completion]] of $[0,1]/(0 \sim 1)$.)  Constructively, there is an [[injection]] $[0,1]/(0 \sim 1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, which is a [[bijection]] if and only if the $LLPO$ holds (for the appropriate kind of real number).

* Every [[semi-decidable proposition]] is a [[decidable proposition]] iff $\mathrm{LPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds. 

* Bolzano-Weierstrass compactness of the [[unit interval]] holds if and only if $\mathrm{LPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds. 

* The [[boolean domain]] is a [[sigma-algebra]] if and only if $\mathrm{WLPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds. 

## Related statements

There are various other results that are related to the principles of omniscience. Here are a few:

* In the presence of [[weak countable choice]], [[existential quantifier|there exists]] a [[radix notation|radix expansion]] in any base (e.g., a decimal expansion or binary expansion) for every [[Cauchy real number]] iff $\mathrm{LLPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds; there exists a radix expansion for every [[Dedekind real number]] has iff the analytic $\mathrm{LLPO}$ holds. Without [[weak countable choice]], [[Lifschitz realizability]] gives a model in which $\mathrm{LLPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds but it is not true that there exists a radix expansion in any base for every [[Cauchy real number]], which implies that there are models in which the analytic LLPO holds but it is not true that there exists a radix expansion in any base for every [[Dedekind real number]]. See [[Andrew Swan]]'s answer to [Birchfield (2024)](#Swan24). In addition, the analytic $\mathrm{LLPO}$ holds for the [[Dedekind real numbers]] in [[condensed sets]], but every function from the Dedekind real numbers to the [[boolean domain]] $\mathbb{2}$ is a [[constant function]], which implies that it is not true that there exists a radix expansion in any base for every [[Dedekind real number]]. 

* In the presence of [[countable choice]], $\mathrm{LLPO}_\mathbb{N}$ is equivalent to the claim that the rings of radix expansions in any two bases are isomorphic. See Daniel Mehkeri\'s answer to [Feldman (2010)](#Mehkeri10).

* That every Cauchy real number has a choice of [[radix notation|radix expansion]] in any base (e.g., a decimal expansion or binary expansion) implies that the $\mathrm{WLPO}_\mathbb{N}$ holds; that every Dedekind real number has a choice of radix expansion implies that the analytic $\mathrm{WLPO}$ holds. 

* [[countable set|Subcountability]] of the [[real numbers]] implies the analytic $\mathrm{WLPO}$ because [[natural numbers]] have [[decidable equality]] and injections preserve and reflect decidable equality. 

* The $\mathrm{WLPO}$ implies that the [[real numbers]] are [[uncountably indexed]]. 

* The analytic $\mathrm{LPO}$ implies the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. 

## Models

* Assuming that [[Set]] is a [[Boolean topos]], then $LPO_{\mathbb{N}}$ (the LPO for natural numbers) holds in any [[presheaf topos]] over $Set$ and indeed in any [[locally connected topos]] over $Set$, essentially since then $2^N$ is a constant object.

* The LPO for natural numbers fails in Johnstone's [[topological topos]], due to its internal continuity principle.  Hence, the analytic LPO also fails, since the modulated Cantor reals and Dedekind reals coincide in this topos.  However, the (analytic) LLPO holds, as a consequence of the preservation of finite closed unions by the inclusion of sequential spaces.
