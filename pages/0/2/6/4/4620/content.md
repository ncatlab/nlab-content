# Principles of omniscience

## Idea

In [[logic and foundations]], a __principle of omniscience__ is any principle of [[classical mathematics]] that is not valid in [[constructive mathematics]].  The idea behind the name (which is due to [Bishop (1967)](#Bishop67)) is that, if we attempt to extend the [[computation|computational]] interpretation of constructive mathematics to incorporate one of these principles, we would have to know something that we cannot compute. The main example is the law of [[excluded middle]] ($EM$); to apply $p \vee \neg{p}$ computationally, we must know which of these [[disjunction|disjuncts]] hold; to apply this in all situations, we would have to know everything (hence 'omniscience').

Bishop\'s principles of omniscience may be seen as principles that extend classical logic from [[predicates]] (where $EM$ may happen to be valid, even constructively, for certain predicates) to their [[quantifications]] over infinite domains (where $EM$ is typically not constructively valid).

## Examples

Examples of principles of omniscience include 

* [[limited principle of omniscience]], a weak form of [[excluded middle]] applied to the [[existential quantifier]] for a [[decidable]] [[predicate]] on a given [[domain of discourse]]. 

* [[weak limited principle of omniscience]], a weak form of [[weak excluded middle]] applied to the [[existential quantifier]] for a [[decidable]] [[predicate]] on a given [[domain of discourse]]. 

* [[lesser limited principle of omniscience]], a weak form of [[de Morgan's law]] applied to the [[existential quantifier]] for a [[decidable]] [[predicate]] on a given [[domain of discourse]]. 

* [[Markov's principle]], a weak form of the [[double negation law]] applied to the [[existential quantifier]] for a [[decidable]] [[predicate]] on a given [[domain of discourse]]. 

Bishop's principles of omniscience take the [[domain of discourse]] to be the [[natural numbers]]. However, it is possible to use some other domain of discourse to get a different principle of omniscience. 

There are also the [[analytic principles of omniscience]], which are versions of Bishop's principles of omniscience that are used in [[real analysis]], including

* [[analytic LPO]]

* [[analytic WLPO]]

* [[analytic LLPO]]

* [[analytic Markov's principle]]

In addition, in [King 2024](#King24) there are more generalizations of the principles of omniscience listed above, which are equivalent to Bishop's principles of omniscience under the [[weak countable choice]] principle $\mathrm{AC}_{\mathbb{N}, 2}$. 

There are also generalisations of the principles of omniscience involving [[inequality spaces]]:

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[decidable tight apartness]], which generalises [[LPO]] and [[analytic LPO]]. In the presence of [[function sets]], this is equivalent to [[excluded middle]]. 

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[decidable equality]], which generalises [[WLPO]] and [[analytic WLPO]]. In the presence of [[function sets]], this is equivalent to [[weak excluded middle]]. 

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[stable relation|stable]] [[tight apartness]], which generalises [[Markov's principle]] and [[analytic Markov's principle]]. In the presence of [[function sets]], this is equivalent to the [[double negation law]].
