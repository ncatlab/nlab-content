## Idea

"Harmonic oscillator" is a fancy name for a rock on a spring: 

* in [[classical mechanics]] it is the [[physical system]] given by a point mass in a parabolic potential, feeling [[forces]] driving it back to a specified origin that are propertional to the distance of the [[mass]] from that origin.

* in [[quantum mechanics]] and in particular [[quantum field theory]] the quantum harmonic oscillator governs not just the dynamics of idealized point masses but crucially appears in the dynamics of all free massive quantum fields. 

To quote the field theorist Sidney Coleman,
> The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction.

## Classical oscillator

First the harmonic oscillator in [[classical mechanics]].

The [[force]] exerted by a spring is proportional to how far you stretch it:
\[F = k x.\]
The [[potential energy]] stored in a stretched spring is the integral of that:
\[V_0 = \frac{1}{2}k x^2 + C,\]
and to make things work out nicely, we're going to choose $C = -1/2.$  The total [[energy]] $H_0$ is the sum of the potential and the kinetic energy:
\[H_0 = V_0 + T = \frac{1}{2}k x^2 + \frac{1}{2}m v^2 - \frac{1}{2}.\]
By choosing units so that $k = m = 1,$ we get
\[H_0 = \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{p^2}{2} - \frac{1}{2},\]
where $p$ is momentum.

## Quantum harmonic oscillator

Now the harmonic oscillator in [[quantum mechanics]].

We [[quantization|quantize]], getting a quantum harmonic oscillator, or QHO.  We set $p = -i \frac{\partial}{\partial x},$ taking units where $\hbar = 1.$  Now 
\[\array{ [x, p]x^n & = & (x p - p x)x^n \\ & = &(- x i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} x)x^n \\ & = & -i(n x^n - (n+1)x^n) \\ & = & i x^n. }\]

If we define a new [[observable]] $z = \frac{p + ix}{\sqrt{2}},$ then 
\[\array{ z z^* & = & \frac{(p + i x)}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{(p - i x)}{\sqrt{2}} \\ & = & \frac{1}{2}(p^2 + i(x p - p x) + x^2) \\ & = & \frac{1}{2}(p^2 -1 + x^2) \\ & = & H_0. }\]
We can think of $z^*$ as $\frac{d}{dz}$ and write the energy [[eigenvector]]s as [[polynomial]]s in $z:$
\[H_0 z^n = z \frac{d}{dz} z^n = n z^n.\]  
The creation operator $z$ adds a photon to the mix; there's only one way to do that, so $z\cdot z^n = 1 z^{n+1}.$  The annihilation operator $\frac{d}{dz}$ destroys one of the photons; in the state $z^n$, there are $n$ [[photon]]s to choose from, so $\frac{d}{dz} z^n = n z^{n-1}.$

[[Schrodinger equation|Schr√∂dinger's equation]] says $i \frac{d}{dt} \psi = H_0 \psi,$ so 
\[\psi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-itn} a_n z^n.\]
This way of representing the state of a QHO is known as the _Fock basis_.
