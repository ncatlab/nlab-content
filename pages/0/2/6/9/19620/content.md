**Ex falso quodlibet** is Latin for "from falsehood, anything". It is also called the **principle of explosion**. In [[logic]] it refers to the principle that when a contradiction can be derived in a system, then any proposition follows. In [[type theory]] it is the [[elimination rule]] of the [[empty type]]. 

*Ex falso quodlibet* holds in many logics, such as [[classical logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]], but it fails to hold in [[paraconsistent logic]], which was devised to allow controlled inconsistency.

Variants of the principle's name include *ex falso sequitur quodlibet*, "from falsehood, anything follows", and *ex contradictione (sequitur) quodlibet*, "from contradiction, anything (follows)").
