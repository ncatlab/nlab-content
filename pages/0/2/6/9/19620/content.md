## Idea

**Ex falso quodlibet** is Latin for "from falsehood, anything". It is also called the **principle of explosion**. 

In [[logic]] it refers to the principle that when a [[contradiction]] can be derived in a logical system, then any [[proposition]] follows. 

In [[type theory]] it is the [[elimination rule]] of the [[empty type]] (see [there](empty+type#RecursionPrinciple)). 

*Ex falso quodlibet* holds in many systems of logic, such as [[classical logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]], but it fails to hold in [[paraconsistent logic]], which was devised to allow controlled inconsistency.

Variants of the principle's name include *ex falso sequitur quodlibet*, "from falsehood, anything follows", and *ex contradictione (sequitur) quodlibet*, "from contradiction, anything (follows)").
