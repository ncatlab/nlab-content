## Idea

Consider the [[quadratic function]] 

\[ \label{eqn} f(x) \coloneqq a{x}^2 + b{x} + c \]
 
which we wish to find the elements of the [[zero set]]. In certain contexts, the elements of the zero set are given by one or more versions of the quadratic formula.

## Discussion

The coefficients $a, b, c$ of the quadratic function are commonly taken from an [[algebraically closed field]] $K$ of [[characteristic]] $0$, such as the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]], although any quadratically closed field whose characteristic is not $2$ would work just as well.  Alternatively, the coefficients can be taken from a [[real closed field]] $K$, such as the field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]]; then the solutions belong to $K[\mathrm{i}]$.  (Of course, $\mathbb{R}[\mathrm{i}]$ is simply $\mathbb{C}$ again.)  More generally, starting from any [[integral domain]] $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$, the solutions belong to some [[splitting field]] of $K$.  (Of course, there are solutions in *some* splitting field, regardless of the characteristic, but they are not given by the quadratic formula if the characteristic is $2$.)

### Forms of the formula

Explicitly, the zero set of (eq:eqn) may be given by the __usual quadratic formula__
\[ \label{usual} x_\pm = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4a{c}}}{2a} ,\]
which works as long as $a \ne 0$.  There is also an __alternate quadratic formula__
\[ \label{alt} x_\pm = \frac{2c}{-b \mp \sqrt{b^2 - 4a{c}}} ,\]
which may be obtained from (eq:usual) by rationalizing the numerator; this works as long as $c \ne 0$.  (Note that $\pm$ and $\mp$ appear here simply to indicate the two [[square roots]] of the determinant $b^2 - 4a{c}$ and how they correspond to the two solutions $x_\pm$; we do not need to have a [[function]] $\sqrt{}$ which always chooses a 'principal' square root.)

These two formulas are reconciled in the [[projective line]] of $K$.  As long as $(a, b, c) \ne (0, 0, 0)$, there are two solutions (which might happen to be equal) in the projective line.  If $a = 0$, then one of these solutions is $\infty$, and (eq:usual) correctly gives us that solution (as long as $b \ne 0$) for one choice of square root, although it gives $0/0$ for the other choice.  Similarly, (eq:alt) correctly gives us $x = 0$ when $c = 0$ and $b \ne 0$, but it does not give us the other root when $c = 0$.  Note that if $a, c = 0$ but $b \ne 0$, then (eq:usual) gives us one root ($\infty$) while (eq:alt) gives us the other ($0$).

So in general, we should be given $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, or $c \ne 0$ for a nondegenerate equation (eq:eqn).  If $a \ne 0$, then we use (eq:usual); if $c \ne 0$, then we use (eq:alt).  Finally, if $b \ne 0$, then we use both; each root will be successfully given by at least one formula for some choice of square root of $b^2 - 4a{c}$.

When the coefficients come from an [[ordered field]] $K$ (which we assume real closed), then we can write down a formula specially for the case when $b \ne 0$.  This is the __numerical analysts\' quadratic formula__
\[ \label{numanal} \begin {gathered}
   \displaystyle x_{\hat{b}} = \frac{2c}{-b - \hat{b}\sqrt{b^2 - 4a{c}}} ;\\
   \displaystyle x_{-\hat{b}} = \frac{-b - \hat{b}\sqrt{b^2 - 4a{c}}}{2a} .\\
\end {gathered} \]
In this formula, $\hat{b}$ is the sign of $b$, that is $b/{|b|}$; also, we must choose a nonnegative principal square root, so that $\sqrt{b^2 - 4a{c}} \lt 0$ in $K$ is avoided (and thus the common denominator of $x_{\hat{b}}$ and numerator of $x_{-\hat{b}}$ is nonzero even if not imaginary).  Despite the name, this formula is not sufficient for all purposes in [[numerical analysis]]; one still needs all three formulas and chooses between them based on whether $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, or $c \ne 0$ is best established.

### Constructive issues

Everything above is valid in weak forms of [[constructive mathematics]] if one takes $\mathbb{C} \coloneqq \mathbb{C}_C$ to be the [[modulated Cauchy real numbers|modulated Cauchy]] complex numbers, see [Ruitenberg (1991)](#Ruitenberg91). 

However, if one takes $\mathbb{C} \coloneqq \mathbb{C}_D$ to be the [[Dedekind real numbers|Dedekind]] complex numbers, there is an interesting issue about whether $b^2 - 4a{c} \ne 0$. Everything above is valid in weak forms of [[constructive mathematics]] except for the statement that $\mathbb{C}_D$ is [[quadratic closure|quadratically closed]]. That claim follows from [[weak countable choice]] ($WCC$), which in turn will follow from either [[excluded middle]] or [[countable choice]]. Nevertheless, the statement
$$ \forall\, a, b, c\colon \mathbb{C}_D,\; \exists\, r\colon \mathbb{C}_D,\; r^2 = b^2 - 4a{c} $$
is false in (for example) the [[internal language]] of the [[sheaf topos]] over the [[real line]]. (Essentially, this is because there is no [[continuous map]] $\sqrt{}$ on any neighbourhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{C}_D$.)  If we are given that $a, b, c$ are real, or if we are given that $b^2 \ne 4a{c}$, then there is no problem.  But in general, we cannot define this square root, which appears in every version of the quadratic formula.

However, there is a more subtle sense in which $\mathbb{C}_D$ is algebraically closed even without $WCC$; essentially, this allows us to approximate the [[subset]] of $\mathbb{C}_D$ whose elements are the two solutions of (eq:eqn) (using two-element subsets of the field of, say, [[Gaussian numbers]]) even if we can\'t approximate any one solution (using individual, say, Gaussian numbers); see [Richman (1998)](#Richman) for details.  The quadratic formula can then be interpreted as indicating this approximated subset.

### Simplified formulas and characteristic $2$

Sometimes one considers the quadratic function
\[f(x) \coloneqq a{x}^2 + 2p{x} + c \]
instead of (eq:eqn); then (eq:usual) simplifies to
\[ \label{simpl} x_\pm = \frac{-p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - a{c}}}a \]
(and similarly for (eq:alt) and (eq:numanal)).

This is valid even in characteristic $2$, but unfortunately then it is fairly useless, since $b = 2p = 0$.  More precisely, if $b = 0$, then (eq:simpl) with $p = 0$ gives the roots $\pm\sqrt{-c/a}$ in any characteristic, but in that case the equation was easy to solve without any formula.  On the other hand, if $b \ne 0$ and $\char K = 2$, then no version of the quadratic formula is applicable, yet this gives no information as to whether the polynomial is [[solvable polynomial|solvable]] and what its roots are if it is.  For example, the quadratic function $f(x) \coloneqq x^2 + x$ has roots $0$ and $1$ in $\F_2$ (or $0$ and $-1$ in any field, as may be found by factoring), while $f(x) \coloneqq x^2 + x + 1$ is not solvable over $\F_2$, yet both have $b^2 - 4a{c} = 1$ and give $0/0$ in both (eq:usual) and (eq:alt) (while (eq:numanal) and (eq:simpl) are directly inapplicable).
