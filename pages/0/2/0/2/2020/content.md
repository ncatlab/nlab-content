A [[category]] $C$ is __noetherian__ if it is [[svelte category|svelte]] and every object in $C$ is a [[noetherian object]]. 

An [[abelian category]] is called __locally noetherian__ if it satisfies axiom (AB5) and has a small generating family of noetherian objects. 

The [[full subcategory]] of noetherian objects in any locally noetherian abelian category is itself a noetherian abelian category. A category $R Mod$ of [[modules]] over a [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] [[commutative unital ring]] $R$, and more generally, the category $Qcoh(X)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules over any [[noetherian scheme]] $X$, is a locally noetherian abelian category; moreover the full subcategory of noetherian objects in $Qcoh(X)$ in this case is the category of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules over $X$. 

A [[filtered colimit]] of [[injective object]]s in any locally noetherian abelian category is injective.
