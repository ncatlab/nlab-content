## Idea

The Hahn--Banach theorem explains why the concept of [[locally convex spaces]] is of interest in the analysis of [[topological vector spaces]]: It ensures that such a space will have enough continuous linear functionals such that the topological dual space is interesting.


## Foundational issues

The full Hahn--Banach theorem may be seen as a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]; this is the perpsective taken in, for example, _[[HAF]]_.  It fails in [[dream mathematics]] and is generally not accepted in [[constructive mathematics]].  (Does it actually imply [[excluded middle]]?)

However, the Hahn--Banach theorem for [[separable spaces]] is much weaker.  It may be proved constructively using only [[dependent choice]].  There is also a version of the theorem for [[locales]] (or so I heard).
