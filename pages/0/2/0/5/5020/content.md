## Idea

One analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of _[[epimorphism]]_ in [[category theory]]. Beware that there are other variants such as _[[effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category]]_ and generally the concept of _[[n-epimorphism]]_.

## Definition

For $C$ an [[(∞,1)-category]], a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in $C$ is an **[[epimorphism]]** if for all $A \in C$ the induced morphism

$$
  C(f,A) : C(Y,A) \to C(X,A)
$$

is a [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]].


## Examples
 {#Examples}

*  A morphism $A\to B$ of [[E-infinity rings]] is an epimorphism iff $B$ is smashing over $A$, i.e., if $B\wedge_A B\approx B$.

* A morphis, $X\to Y$ between [[connected spaces]] is an epimorphism iff $Y$ is formed via a Quillen-plus construction from a [[perfect group|perfect]] [[normal subgroup]] of the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1 X$.
