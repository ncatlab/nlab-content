## Definition

An **reflexive symmetric relation** is a [[binary relation]] that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]. 

## Examples

* Every [[equivalence relation]] is an reflexive symmetric relation which is also a [[transitive relation]]. 

* The negation of a [[irreflexive symmetric relation]] is a reflexive symmetric relation. 

* The [[double negation]] of every [[equivalence relation]] is an irreflexive symmetric relation. In [[constructive mathematics]], this is not guaranteed to be transitive. 

## In constructive mathematics
 {#ConstructiveMathematics}

In constructive mathematics, the [[double negation]] of [[equality]] cannot in general be proven to be an [[equivalence relation]], because the [[denial inequality]] cannot be proved to be an [[apartness relation]]. Instead, the double negation of equality is only a stable reflexive symmetric relation. Indeed, since excluded middle cannot be proven, we could distinguish between the following reflexive symmetric relations in constructive mathematics:

* [[equality]]

* [[equivalence relations]], a transitive reflexive symmetric relation

* [[double negation]] of [[equality]]

* [[stable relation|stable]] reflexive symmetric relation, a reflexive symmetric relation $\approx$ which additionally satisfies $\neg \neg (a \approx b)$ implies $a \approx b$

* [[decidable relation|decidable]] reflexive symmetric relation, an reflexive symmetric relation $\approx$ which additionally satisfies $(a \approx b)$ or $\neg (a \approx b)$
