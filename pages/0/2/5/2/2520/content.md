In [[classical physics]] to every classical mechanical system (with finitely many degrees of freedom, but also with infinitely many, i.e. [[classical field theory]]) one associates an __action functional__ on a space of paths in the configuration space, which determines the laws of motion by the __action principle__: the motion of a particle corresponds to a path in configuration space which minimizes the action functional. The action functional is obtained by integrating the [[Lagrangian]] function along the path; in the case of a continuum system, the Lagrangian function is obtained by integrating the Lagrangian density.

There is a path integral version of [[quantization]], which emphasizes on Lagrangian formalism and path integrals.  Most other approaches to quantization favor the Hamiltonian approach and phase space. In path integral approach, the amplitudes in [[quantum field theory]] are expressed in terms of the [[path integral]] of the action functional over the space of paths in the space of field configurations.
