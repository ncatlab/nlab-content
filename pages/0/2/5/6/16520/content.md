## Idea

What is called _black body radiation_ is the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by an ideal non-reflecting ("black") piece of [[matter]] in [[thermal equilibrium]] with the [[electromagnetic field]] around it, at any given [[temperature]].

The [[experiment|experimentally]] observed black body radiation spectrum is a key effect and property of [[quantum physics]], governed by [[energy]]/[[frequency]] quantization controlled by [[Planck's constant]]. In contrast, in [[classical field theory]] black body radiation comes out incorrectly, with an infinite [[energy] in the high [[frequency]] modes (historically: "[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]").
