The terminology 'plus construction' is used for three very different types of construction.


 *  The version which sends a presheaf to a separated presheaf to a sheaf is described at _[[plus construction on presheaves]]_ and _[[sheaf]]_.

*  The process of killing a perfect normal subgroup of the fundamental group of a space is described under [[Quillen plus construction]].

* The assignment, due to [[John Baez]] and [[James Dolan]], $O \mapsto O^+$ sending a [[operad]] (with colours $S$) to a new operad whose algebras are $S$-coloured operads equipped with an operad morphism to $O$ (i.e. [[slice category|slices]] over $O$).
