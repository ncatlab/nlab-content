## Idea ##

There are two circle constants used in [[geometry]], the more common circle constant $\pi$ representing the straight angle, and the less common circle constant $\tau = 2 \pi$ representing a full turn. 

## History ##

Leonard Euler original definition of the circle constant $\pi$ was the constant valued as 6.283..., which is equivalent in today's notion as $\tau$. Euler's definition was often used in competition with the definition 3.1415.. until the late 1700s, when mathematicians collectively decided on standardizing $\pi$ as 3.1415... 

However, in 2010, Michael Hartl proposed that the constant 6.283... which equals $2 \pi$ is much better for mathematics than $\pi$, as it would get rid of a significant number of factors of 2 from many equations, and is intuitively better for teaching and understanding subjects such as trigonometry and geometry, and proposed using the symbol $\tau$ for $2 \pi$. Since then, a few mathematicians such as Peter Harremoës have used $\tau$ instead of $\pi$ for research mathematics, and $\tau$ has been incorporated into a number of [[programming languages]] such as [[Python]] and [[Rust]].
