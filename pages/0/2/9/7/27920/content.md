This page is meant to list problems in ([[higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] that have been stated in the literature (here meant in a broad sense including papers, preprints, blog posts, and so on). Each problem should come with a reference to where it has been posed. A problem is considered closed when it is solved by a published paper, after which it should be removed from this page (with a link to the corresponding paper in the comment accompanying the change).

## Topos theory

Open problems in [[topos theory]]:

- [[William Lawvere|Lawvere]]'s *[[Open problems in topos theory]]* 

  (some of which have by now been resolved)

## Higher category theory

Open problems in [[higher category theory]]:

- [[Simpson's conjecture]]

- [[cobordism hypothesis]] 

  an extensive proof sketch was given (and published as such) by [Lurie 2009](#Lurie09); a proof along a new strategy is claimed by [Grady & Pavlov 2021](#GradyPavlov), but not yet published

- [[tangle hypothesis]]
