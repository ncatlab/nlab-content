This page is intended to contain problems in [[category theory]] that have been stated in the literature (here meant in a broad sense including papers, preprints, blog posts, and so on). Each problem should come with a reference to where it has been posed. A problem is considered closed when it is solved by a published paper, after which it should be removed from this page (with a link to the corresponding paper in the comment accompanying the change).

## Topos theory

- See [Lawvere's open problems in topos theory](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102183343/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/Openproblemstopos.htm) (some of which have nonetheless by now been resolved).

## Higher category theory

- [[Simpson's conjecture]]
- [[cobordism hypothesis]] (with a solution claimed by [Grady and Pavlov](#GradyPavlov), but not yet published)
- [[tangle hypothesis]]
