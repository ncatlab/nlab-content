## Definition 

__Krull dimension__ of a commutative ring $R$ is a supremum of lengths of chains
$$
P_1\subset P_2\subset\ldots \subset P_r
$$
of distinct [[prime ideal]]s in $R$.

If $R$ is a possibly noncommutative ring $R$ and $M$ a left $R$-module, then the __Krull dimension__ of $M$ is by definition a deviation of the poset of subobjects of $M$. 

A deviation of a poset is defined recursively. 

* the deviation of a trivial poset is $-\infty$
* the deviation of a poset satisfying a [[descending chain condition]] is $0$
* a poset has a deviation less than $\alpha$ for an ordinal $\alpha$ if for every descending chain
$$
a_1\geq a_2\geq \ldots\geq a_n\geq\ldots
$$
the subposets of all elements 
between $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$
do not have deviation of less than $\alpha$ 
for at most finitely many $n$.
