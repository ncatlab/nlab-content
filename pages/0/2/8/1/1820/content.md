**Definition** (Jeff Smith)

A [[model category]] $C$ is **combinatorial** if

* it is a [[presentable category]]

* it has a set of [[generating cofibrations]] and of trivial generating cofibrations.

# Remarks #

Of interest are the combinatorial model categories that are at the same time [[simplicial model category|simplicial model categories]]. These are precisely those that present [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]].

See [[combinatorial simplicial model category]].
