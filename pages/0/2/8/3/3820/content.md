In [[classical mechanics]] the **phase space** of a mechanical system is a [[symplectic manifold]] (or, more generally, a [[Poisson manifold]]) attached to the system. The laws of motion on the phase space are the Hamiltonian equations of motion, which are in turn determined by a choice of a Hamiltonian function which is just a distinguished smooth function on the phase space (and of time, for nonautonomous systems). 

If the system is defined by [[configuration space]] $X$ (space of positions of the particles) formalism, then the phase space of the system is given by the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X$. However some models are obtained by [[Hamiltonian reduction]] by moding out many degrees of freedom which can be integrated out somehow (due say presence of [[conservation law]]s). This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general.
