#Definition#

A **fusion category** is a [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]]  [[semisimple category|semisimple]] linear ([[Vect]]-[[enriched category|enriched]]) [[monoidal category]], with only finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects, such that the endomorphisms of the unit object is just the ground field $k$.

#Remarks#

The name "fusion category" comes from the central examples of structures whose canonical [[tensor product]] is called a "fusion product", notably representations of [[loop group]]s and of [[Hopf algebra]]s and of [[vertex operator algebra]]s. 

Fusion categories were first systematically studied by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik in [On fusion categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203060). This paper listed many examples and proved many properties of fusion categories. One of the important conjectures made in that paper was the following:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Conjecture (Etingof, Nikshcych and Ostrik)

Every fusion category admits a [[pivotal structure]].
=--

Providing a certain condition is satisfied, a pivotal structure on a fusion category can be shown to correspond to a 'twisted' monoidal natural transformation of the identity functor on the category, where the twisting is given by the [[pivotal symbols]].
