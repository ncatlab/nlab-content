A **topological submersion** is a map in [[Top]] generalising the sort of map that is called a [[submersion]] in [[Diff]].

There are two definitions of a topological submersion $p:Y \to X$:

* Each point in $Y$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $p\big|_U : U \simeq p(U) \times Z \to p(U)$ is projection  on the first factor. Sometimes $Z$ is required to be $\mathbb{R}^n$, but this is a bit restrictive.

* Each point $p$ of $Y$ has a local section $\sigma: V \to Y$ with $p\in V$ and $p = \sigma(x)$.

The second definition includes the first as a special case.

Surjective topological submersions form a singleton [[Grothendieck pretopology]] on [[Top]].
