#Idea#

Ordinary [[gravity]] -- as a [[classical field theory]] -- is determined by an [[action functional]] on a space of [[Riemannian metric]]s on a given [[manifold]]: the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]].

In **supergravity** the [[manifold]] in question is equipped with a [[Spin structure]] and the Einstein-Hilbert action functional is extended to one on the space of [[Riemannian metric]]s and [[section]]s of a [[vector bundle]] associated to the [[spinor bundle]]. 

To qualify as a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theory this action functional is required to be invariant under certain operations on the space of metrics and spinor sections that may mix both. In general this desired invariance is achieved only if the action functional is extended still a bit further to a space of metrics, [[spinor]] sections and certain [[differential form]]s on the [[manifold]]. 

The extra degress of freedom in supergravity theories, the spinor sections and possibly the differential forms, have physically the interpretation of _fermionic_ and _bosonic_ _matter_ fields coupled to ordinary gravity. Therefore theories of supergravity may be regarded as ordinary theories of gravity and matter, subject to peculiar constraints on the nature of the matter fields.

The desired [[supersymmetry]] constraint in supergravity theories turns out to be rather restrictive. For instance there is, under mild assumptions, a _unique_ maximally supersymmetric supergravity extension of the ordinary Einsten-Hilbert action on a 4-dimensional manifold. This in turn is obtained from the _unique_ (under mild assumptions) maximally supersymmetric supergravity action functional on an 11-dimensional manifold by thinking of the 4-dimensional action function as being a [[dimensional reduction]] of the 11-dimensional one.

This uniqueness (under mild conditions) is one reason for interest in supergravity theories. Another important reason is that supergravity theories tend to remove some of the problmes that are encountered when trying to realize [[gravity]] as a [[quantum field theory]]. Originally there had been high hopes that the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 4-dimensions is fully [[renormalizable]]. This couldn't been show computationally -- until recently: triggered by new insights recently there there is lots of renewed activity on the renormalizability of maximal supergravity.
