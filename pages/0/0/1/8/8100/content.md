## Idea

The [[action functional]] of the [[type II superstring]] [[sigma-model]] for [[open strings]] ending on [[D-branes]] is, without further conditions, not globally well defined: it is a [[section]] of a possibly non-trivial [[line bundle]] over the configuration space, instead of a plain function. The non-triviality of this line bundle (as a line bundle [[connection on a bundle|with connection]]) is the _Freed-Witten [[quantum anomaly]]_. The necessary conditions for this anomaly to vanish, hence for this line bundle to be trivializable, are the _Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation conditions_.

## Details

... for the moment see the discussion at [[twisted spin^c structure]].

## References

The need for twisted $Spin^c$-structures as [[quantum anomaly]]-cancellaton condition on the [[worldvolume]] of [[D-brane]]s in [[string theory]] was first discussed in

In ([Laine](#Laine)) the discussion of FW-anomaly cancellation with finite-rank gauge bundles is towards the very end, culminating in equation (3.41).
