## Definition

A **Stone locale** is a [[compact space|compact]] [[zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] [[locale]].

## Properties

In presence of the [[axiom of choice]],
every Stone locale is [[spatial]]
and the category of Stone locales
is equivalent to the category of [[Stone spaces]].

## Stone duality

The [[Stone duality]] theorem states
that the category of Stone locales is contravariantly equivalent
to the category of [[Boolean algebras]].

Unlike the corresponding statement for [[Stone spaces]],
this version is fully [[constructive]] and is valid
in any [[W-topos]].

In fact, the traditional [[Stone duality]] is an immediate consequence
of the localic Stone duality and the spatiality of [[Stone locales]].
