## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], the binary [[pushout type]] of [[functions]] $f:A \to B$ and $g:A \to C$ is the [[higher inductive type]] $B \sqcup_{A}^{f, g} C$ generated by functions 

$$\mathrm{in}_B:B \to B \sqcup_{A}^{f, g} C$$
$$\mathrm{in}_C:C \to B \sqcup_{A}^{f, g} C$$
$$\mathrm{glue}:\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{in}(f(x)) = \mathrm{in}(g(x))$$

However, by using large elimination for the [[boolean domain]] $\mathrm{bool}$ on the codomain of the functions and by using the induction principle for the boolean domain on the functions themselves, one has a family of functions

$$\mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g):\prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} A \to \mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, b)$$

and the resulting binary pushout is the type

$$\mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, 0) \sqcup_{A}^{\mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 0), \mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 1)} \mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, 1)$$

generated by functions 

$$\mathrm{in}:\prod_{b:B} \mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, b) \to (\mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, 0) \sqcup_{A}^{\mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 0), \mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 1)} \mathrm{rec}_\mathrm{bool}(B, C, 1))$$
$$\mathrm{glue}:\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{in}(\mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 0, x)) = \mathrm{in}(\mathrm{ind}_\mathrm{bool}(f, g, 1, x))$$

Thus, it suffices to define the binary pushout of a boolean-indexed family of functions 
$f:\prod_{x:\mathrm{bool}} A \to B(x)$, which is the [[higher inductive type]] generated by the constructors

$$\mathrm{in}:\prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} B(b) \to (B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} C(1))$$
$$\mathrm{glue}:\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{in}(0, f(0, x)) = \mathrm{in}(1, f(1, x))$$

For any elements $x:A$ and $y:A$, the [[identity type]] $x = y$ is equivalent to the dependent sum type $\sum_{z:A} (x = z) \times (y = z)$, and so the glue constructor can equivalently be expressed as
$$\mathrm{glue}:\prod_{x:A} \sum_{z:B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} B(1)} (\mathrm{in}(0, f(0, x)) = z) \times (\mathrm{in}(1, f(1, x) = z))$$

By induction on the booleans, this is equivalently

$$\mathrm{glue}:\prod_{x:A} \sum_{z:B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} B(1)} \prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} \mathrm{in}(b, f(b, x)) = z$$

which by the [[type theoretic axiom of choice]] is equivalently 

$$\mathrm{glue}:\sum_{C:A \to (B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} B(1))} \prod_{x:A} \prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} \mathrm{in}(b, f(b, x)) = C(x)$$

Unwrapping the dependent sum type, there are now three constructors for the binary pushout of a boolean-indexed family of functions 
$f:\prod_{x:\mathrm{bool}} A \to B(x)$:

$$\mathrm{in}:\prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} B(b) \to (B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} C(1))$$
$$\mathrm{gluehubs}:A \to (B(0) \sqcup_A^{f(0), f(1)} B(1))$$
$$\mathrm{gluespokes}:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{b:\mathrm{bool}} \mathrm{in}(b, f(b, x)) = \mathrm{gluehubs}(x)$$

By generalizing this definition of binary pushouts from the boolean domain to any arbitrary type, one gets general dependent pushouts of an arbitrary family of functions with [[domain]] $A$, which are also known as *[[wide pushouts]]* in [[category theory]]. 

## Definition

Given a type $A$, an index type $I$, a family of [[codomains]] $B(i)$ indexed by $i:I$, and a family of functions $f:\prod_{i:I} A \to B(i)$, the **dependent pushout type** or **wide pushout type** of $(A, I, B, f)$ is the [[higher inductive type]] $\bigsqcup_{x:I}^{A, f} B(x)$ generated by the constructors

$$\mathrm{in}:\prod_{i:I} B(i) \to \bigsqcup_{x:I}^{A, f} B(x)$$
$$\mathrm{gluehubs}:A \to \bigsqcup_{x:I}^{A, f} B(x)$$
$$\mathrm{gluespokes}:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{i:I} \mathrm{in}(i, f(i, x)) = \mathrm{gluehubs}(x)$$

This is an example of the hubs-and-spokes construction of [[higher inductive types]] discussed in the [[HoTT book]], and is an non-recursive higher inductive type.  

## Examples

* The [[positive type|positive]] [[dependent sum type]] of a family of types $B(x)$ indexed by $x:A$ is the dependent pushout type of the family of unique functions from the [[empty type]] to each $B(x)$. 

* The [[union]] of a family of [[subtypes]] of a type $A$ is given by the dependent pushout type of the [[wide pullback]] of the [[embedding of types|embeddings]] into $A$. 

* Binary [[pushout types]] are boolean-indexed dependent pushout types. 

* When the family of [[codomains]] $B(x)$ indexed by $x:I$ is a constant family of types, then the dependent pushout type are called **dependent coequalizer types** or **wide coequalizer types**.
