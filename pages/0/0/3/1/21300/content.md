## Definition

A morphism $f\colon A\to B$ of [[simplicial sets]]
is a __simplicial homotopy equivalence__
if there is a morphism $g\colon B\to A$
and homotopies $p\colon \Delta^1\times A\to A$ from $id_A$ to $gf$
and $q\colon \Delta^1\times B\to B$ from $fg$ to $id_B$.

## Properties

If $A$ and $B$ are [[Kan complexes]],
then $f$ is simplicial homotopy equivalence
if and only if $f$ has the [[right homotopy lifting property]] with respect to $\partial\Delta^n\to\Delta^n$.

All simplicial homotopy equivalences are [[simplicial weak equivalences]].
The converse is true if $A$ and $B$ are [[Kan complexes]].
