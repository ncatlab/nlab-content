An early set of lecture notes:

* [[Shigeo Sasaki]], _Almost contact manifolds, Part 1_, Lecture Notes, Mathematical Institute, Tohoku University (1965).

* [[Shigeo Sasaki]], _Almost contact manifolds, Part 2_, Lecture Notes, Mathematical Institute, Tohoku University (1967).

* [[Shigeo Sasaki]], _Almost contact manifolds, Part 3_, Lecture Notes, Mathematical Institute, Tohoku University (1968).

> Even today, after 40 years, the breath, depth and the relative completeness of the Sasaki lectures is truly quite remarkable. $[...]$ As it is, the notes are not easily available and, consequently, not well-known. ([Boyer-Galicki 07, p. 1](Sasakian+manifold#BoyerGalicki07))
