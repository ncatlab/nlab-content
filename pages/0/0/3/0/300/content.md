There is just one _(-2)-category_, namely the truth value $True$.  

The notions of [[(-1)-category]] and (-2)-category were introduced by [[James Dolan]] and [[Toby Bartels]] in order to complete the [[periodic table of n-categories]].   They also shed light on the theory of homotopy groups and [[n-stuff]].  For an account see [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=11) of 

* John Baez and Michael Shulman, _Lectures on $n$-categories and cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)), to appear in _$n$-Categories: Foundations and Applications_, eds. J. Baez and P. May.
