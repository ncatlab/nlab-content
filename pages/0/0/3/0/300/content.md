There is just one _(-2)-category_, namely the truth value $True$. Compare the concepts of [[(-1)-category]] (a [[truth value]] in general) and [[0-category]] (a [[set]]). The point of $(-2)$-categories is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table]] of $n$-categories. (They also shed light on the theory of [[homotopy group]]s and [[n-stuff]].)

For example, there should be a $(-1)$-category of $(-2)$-categories; this is the true truth value. The category of $(-2)$-categories is a [[monoidal category]] in a unique way; then a [[enriched category|category enriched]] over this is a $(-1)$-category; such is necessarily an enriched groupoid. If you think of a $(-1)$-category as a [[0-poset]], then this makes a $(-2)$-category a [[(-1)-poset]]. If you think of a $(-1)$-category as a [[(-1)-groupoid]], then this makes a $(-2)$-category a [[(-2)-groupoid]].

For an introduction to [[(-1)-category|(-1)-categories]] and $(-2)$-categories see [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=11) of

$(-1)$-categories and $(-2)$-categories were discovered (or invented) by [[James Dolan]] and [[Toby Bartels]]. To witness these concepts in the process of being discovered, read the discussion here:
