## Idea ##

A generalisation of various kinds of [[spaces]] equipped with a relation between its elements and its filters, such as [[filter spaces]], [[convergence spaces]], and [[cluster spaces]].

WARNING: “Generalised filter space” is a placeholder name for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. If this concept already exists in the literature under another name, feel free to rename this page; alternatively, if "generalised filter space" is already being used for a different concept from the one described in this article, feel free to develop another name for this concept and move this article to that name.

## Definition 

Given a set $S$, let $\mathcal{F}(S)$ denote the set of [[filters]] on $S$. A set $S$ is a __generalised filter space__ if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the $\mathcal{F}(S)$ and $S$ itself, for elements $x \in \mathcal{F}(S)$ and $c \in S$. 

The definition can also be phrased in terms of [[nets]]; a net $\nu$ converges to $x$ if and only if its [[eventuality filter]] converges to $x$.

The morphisms of generalised filter space are the [[pointwise continuous functions]]; a function $f$ between generalised filter space is __pointwise continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the [[filterbase]] $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$. 

According to the [category theory Zulip](#CTZulip), these structures are equivalently [[algebra for an endofunctor|endofunctor algebras]] for the [[lax functor|lax]] [[extension system|extension]] of the [[filter monad]] to [[Rel]], the [[category]] of [[sets]] and [[relations]].
