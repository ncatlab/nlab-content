## Idea

Let R be a (commutative unital) ring. Suppose I is a flat idempotent R-ideal. 

To be a flat ideal means -⊗I is an exact functor. The tensor product is always right exact, so in particular, -⊗I preserves injections. 

To be idempotent, I² = I.

Fixing a pair (R,I) like this, we construct the category of "I-almost R-modules", alModR.

We take the full subcategory of R-modules spanned by M so that I⊗M≅M. (This is not the actual definition, but this is an equivalent category. See appendix for actual definition.)

the category structure (it's the essential image of the functor ModR→ModR via M↦I⊗M, it's an Abelian category, and it's a localization of ModR).

There is an inclusion of categories j_! : alModR → ModR.

There is an exact right adjoint of j_!, denoted j* : ModR → alModR which sends M to I⊗M. 

And j* has a right adjoint j_* : alModR → ModR via 
j_*(M) = Hom(I, j_!(M)).

j* does legitimately map into alModR. To prove this, we must show that I⊗j*M≅j*M.

I⊗j*M = I⊗(I⊗M).
Since I is a flat ideal, ≅ I²⊗M.
Since I is idempotent, ≅ I⊗M = j*M.

we can think of j* as sending a module to the nearest almost module. 

In some sense, the ideal I acts like an identity (under the tensor product) for almost modules. So the idea here is that I doesn't really do anything to the (I-)almost R modules.

An R-module M is (I-)almost 0 if IM = 0.

Since I is idempotent, if IM = 0, then j*M = I⊗M = 0 as well.

So the nearest "almost module" to an "almost 0" module is 0 itself. The only defect to being 0 is killed by the identity-like ideal.

Let f : M → N be an R-linear map. 

f is almost injective if ker f is almost 0.
f is almost surjective if coker f is almost 0.
f is an almost isomorphism if ker f and coker f are almost 0.

An "almost" property of a map gets sent to the actual property by j*.

M is almost flat if j*M is flat in alModR; equivalently, if Torᵢ(M,N) is almost 0 for all i > 0 and for all N. 

The problem with alModR is that the projective objects behave strangely, so instead, we define "almost Hom", alHom.

For two almost modules M and N,
alHom(M,N) = j*(Hom(M,N)).

Note: alHom(j*M,j*N) ≅ j*(Hom(M,N)).

Note: For L, M, N in alModR,
Hom(L⊗M,N) ≅ Hom(L, alHom(M,N)) where Hom's are taken in the category alModR.
So we do also get a form of "almost" hom-tensor adjunction.

A module M is almost projective if alHom(j*M,-) is exact in alModR, or equivalently, if Extⁿ(M,N) is almost 0 for all N and for all n > 0.

What are examples of rings R with flat idempotent ideals I?

It turns out that if R is a perfectoid ring and I is generated by a pseudo-uniformizer, then (R,I) satisfies these conditions!

One application is proving the tilting equivalence of perfectoid algebras. Given a perfectoid field K whose pseudo-uniformizer ϖ satisfies |p|≤|ϖ|≤1 for some prime p, there is a perfectoid field K♭ of char p (the tilt of K).

If K is a perfectoid field, then the category of perfectoid K-algebras is equivalent to the category of perfectoid K♭-algebras. Hence, we can reduce some problems in mixed char to char p.

The category of I-almost 0 modules is a Serre subcategory of ModR. The "correct" definition of the category of I-almost R-modules is the quotient of the category of R-modules by the category of I-almost 0 modules.
