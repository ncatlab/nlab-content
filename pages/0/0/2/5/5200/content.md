## The epistemic logics $S4$ and $S4_{(m)}$## 
(Note that $S4 = S4_{(1)}$.)

Although better than $K$ (resp. $K(m)$), the [[the logic T(m)|epistemic logics]], $T$ and $T_{(m)}$, still do not reflect that much of our intuition of 'knowledge'. One of the usual additional ones considered is the logic $S4$ (or in its 'multi-agent' form $S4_{(m)}$).  These involve the axiom scheme know as $(4)$, that is also present in many [[temporal logics]].

## The axioms $(4)_i$## 
This is found in two equivalent forms (for agent $i$):

* $M_i M_i p\to M_i p$

and 

* $K_i p\to K_i K_i p$.

In this second form, it clearly corresponds to ''Agent $i$ knows that (s)he knows what (s)he knows''! That'positive' introspection' seems reasonable.  The dual version interprets as ''If the agent considers that it is possible that it is possible that $p$ holds, then the agent considers it possible that $p$ holds'' and again that is 'common sense'.
