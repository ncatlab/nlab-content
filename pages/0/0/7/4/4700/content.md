## Graph complex
 {#GraphComplex}

Roughly:

Consider the [[complex vector space]] $\mathcal{G}$ [[linear span|spanned]] by the [[isomorphism classes]] of [[orientation|oriented]] [[ribbon graphs]] [[quotient|modulo]] the [[relation]] $(\Gamma,-\sigma) = - (\Gamma, \sigma)$ where $\sigma$ is an [[orientation]] on the [[graph]] $\Gamma$. 

A [[differential]] on this vector space is given by

$$
  \partial(\Gamma) 
    \coloneqq 
  \sum_{e\in E(\Gamma)\backslash Loop(\Gamma)} \Gamma/e
  \,,
$$

where the [[sum]] is over [[edges]] $e$ which are not [[loops]] (have distinct [[source]] and [[target]]) and $\Gamma/e$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by contraction at edge $e$ (cf. [[ribbon graph]]). 

This function $\partial$ is indeed a differential, in that it satisfies $\partial^2 = 0$, because two contractions in different order produce a different orientation. 

The resulting [[chain complex]] $(\mathcal{G}_\bullet, \partial)$ is called the _graph complex_. Its [[chain homology]] $H_\bullet(\mathcal{G}, \partial)$ is called _graph homology_.

This is originally due to ([Kontsevich 94, pages 11-12](#Kontsevich94)). For a detailed and careful account see [Lambrechts-Volic 14, section 6](#LambrechtsVolic14).





## Properties

### General properties

There is a canonical [[graded object|bigrading]] on the graph complex, where $\mathcal{G}_{i j}$ is generated by those graphs which have $i$ [[vertices]] and $j$ [[edges]]; the differential has bidegree $(-1,-1)$; each $\mathcal{G}_{i j}$ is finite-dimensional, while the whole complex is infinite-dimensional. 

The graph complex splits into a [[direct sum]] of subcomplexes labelled by the  [[Euler characteristics]] of the underlying graph. 

The structure of a graph complex reflects a structure in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg complex]] of a certain [[Lie algebra]]; and the graph homology to the relative Lie homology of that Lie algebra as shown by Kontsevich. 


### $L_\infty$-algebra structure

The Graph complex carries the structure of a [[dg-Lie algebra]] ([[L-infinity algebra]]) which acts on the space of choices of [[formal deformation quantization]] of [[Poisson manifolds]]. Its degree-0 [[chain homology]] is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Grothendieck-Teichmüller group]]. 

The homology in negative degree vanishes and that in positive degree is still unknown, but computer experiements show that at least the third cohomology contains nontrivial elements.

The degree-0 homology is also isomorphic, up to one "scaling class", to the 0th cohomology of the [[derivations]] of the [[Ek-operad|E2 operad]].

### Relation to configuration spaces
 {#RelationToConfigurationSpaces}

The system of graph complexes is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the [[ordinary cohomology|real cohomology]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] ([Campos-Willwacher 16, theorem 1](#CamposWillwacher16)).

## Examples 

* Graph complexes may be obtained from the [[Feynman transform]] of a [[modular operad]].


## Further applications

...moduli spaces

...deformation theory

...Rozansky-Witten theory

...Vassiliev invariants

...description of the classifying space $BOut(F_n)$ of the group of outer automorphisms of a free group with $n$ generators

Graph complex controls the universal $L_\infty$-deformations of the space of polyvector fields. 

## Generalizations

There are generalizations for $d$-algebras (algebras over little disc operad in higher dimension). The cohomological graph complex is then the case for $d=2$. There is also a "directed" version. On the other hand, graph complex
