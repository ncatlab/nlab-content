A morphism $f:X\to Y$ of [[schemes]] is smooth if it is [[flat morphism|flat]] and finitely presented (cf. [[relativization in algebraic geometry]]) and if all the fibers $f^{-1}(y)$ where $y\in Y$ are [[smooth schemes]] over the corresponding residue fields $k_y$. 

Smoothness of a morphism is a weaker notion than the notion of a morphism being [[etale morphism|Ã©tale]], but stronger than the notion of [[formally smooth morphism|formal smoothness]].
