## Idea 

A Schwartz-Bruhat function is a certain type of complex-valued function on a general [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological abelian group|abelian group]], generalizing the familiar notion of [[Schwartz space|Schwartz function]] on a space given as a finite product of copies of the real line, of the circle, and a finitely generated abelian group. 

## Definitions 

The notion of Schwartz-Bruhat function is constructed in stages that parallel developments in the general structure theory of locally compact (Hausdorff) abelian groups. 

Recall the notion of *compactly generated topological group* $G$: it means there is a compact neighborhood of the identity which generates $G$ as a group. The structure of a compactly generated abelian Lie group is well-known: it is a product of type $K \times \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{Z}^n$ where $K$ is a [[compactum|compact]] [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] (thus of the form $T^p \times F$ where $F$ is a finite abelian group and $T = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is a circle group). These are often called *elementary Lie groups*.

###### Definition 
Let $G$ be an elementary Lie group of type $K \times \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{Z}^n$ where $K$ is a compact abelian Lie group. A *Schwartz-Bruhat function* on $G$ is an [[smooth function|infinitely differentiable function]] $f: G \to \mathbb{C}$ that is *rapidly decreasing*: applications of any polynomial differential operator to $f$ is uniformly bounded in the $\mathbb{R}$- and $\mathbb{Z}$-variables, in the sense that 

$$
  \underset{\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n}{\forall}\;\;
  \underset{\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{N}^m}{\forall}\;\; \underset{K_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma} \gt 0}{\exists}\;
  \left(
  \underset{(j, x) \in \mathbb{Z}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m}{sup} {\Vert j^\alpha x^\beta \partial_{\gamma} f(x, j)  \Vert} \lt K_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma}
  \right)
$$

using the usual notations for multi-indices $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.

Next, any locally compact abelian group is canonically a [[filtered colimit]] of the system of its open compactly generated subgroups and open inclusions between them. In particular, any abelian Lie group is canonically a filtered colimit of its open elementary Lie subgroups. In fact, an abelian Lie group is of the form $A \times \mathbb{R}^m \times T^p$, where $A$ is a discrete abelian group. We may reckon $A$ as a filtered colimit of its finitely generated subgroups $A_\alpha$; taking the product with the locally compact group $\mathbb{R}^m \times T^p$, any abelian Lie group is a filtered colimit of elementary Lie subgroups $A_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^m \times T^p$.

###### Definition 
A *Schwartz-Bruhat function* on an abelian Lie group $G$ is a continuous function $f: G \to \mathbb{C}$ that is supported on an open elementary Lie subgroup $H$, and whose restriction $f|_H: H \to \mathbb{C}$ is Schwartz-Bruhat in the sense of Definition \ref{def1}. (Thus $f$ is identically zero on the complement of $H$, which is a union of open cosets $g + H$.) 
=-- 

Let $\mathcal{S}(G)$ denote the [[topological vector space|TVS]] of Schwartz-Bruhat functions on an abelian Lie group $G$. We obtain a functor $\mathcal{S}(-): AbLie^{op} \to TVS$. 

Finally, the character group of a compactly generated locally compact abelian group is an abelian Lie group. By applying [[Pontryagin duality]] to the statement that a locally compact abelian group is canonically a filtered colimit of compactly generated subgroups, we see that any locally compact abelian group $G$ is canonically an inverse limit of a cofiltered diagram of abelian Lie groups $G_\alpha$: 

$$G \cong \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_\alpha G_\alpha.$$

We may apply the contravariant functor $\mathcal{S}(-)$ to this cofiltered diagram to produce a filtered diagram of Schwartz-Bruhat spaces $\mathcal{S}(G_\alpha)$ of abelian Lie groups. In this notation,

###### Definition 
For a locally compact abelian group $G$, the Schwartz-Bruhat space $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is the colimit of the filtered diagram of spaces $\mathcal{S}(G_\alpha)$ defined according to Definition \ref{def2}. 
=-- 

In other words, a Schwartz-Bruhat function on $G$ is one that factors through one of its Lie quotients as 

$$G \twoheadrightarrow G_\alpha \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbb{C}$$ 

where $g: G_\alpha \to \mathbb{C}$ is Schwartz-Bruhat in the sense given for Lie groups, Definition \ref{def2}.
