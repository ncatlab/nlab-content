## Idea

A useful smoothness criterium for noncommutative graded algebras.

## Definition

Let $k$ be a field and $A$ a connected finitely generated associative $\mathbf{N}$-graded $k$-algebra. 

$A$ is __Artin-Schelter regular__ (AS regular) algebra if 
the following three conditions hold 

(i) it is of finite [[global dimension]] $d$

(ii) has polynomial growth ($dim A_n$ is bounded above by a polynomial function $f(n)$)

(iii) is Gorenstein: $Ext_A^i({}_A k,A) = 0$ for $i\neq d$ and $Ext_A^d({}_A k,A) = k_A$.

## Literature

The notion is (under the name of regular algebra) introduced in
