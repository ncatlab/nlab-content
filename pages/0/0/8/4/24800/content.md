\section{Idea}

Dependently sorted set theory is a set theory which is a [[first order theory]] with dependent sorts; i.e. written in [[first order logic]] and whose [[domains of discourse]] (called [[sorts]] here) depend on other domains of discourse. In addition, membership $a \in A$ is a judgment, rather than a proposition as in [[unsorted set theory]] and [[two-sorted set theory]]. By and large, dependently sorted set theories are [[structural set theories]], and are [[structurally presented set theories]]. 

Examples of dependently sorted set theories include the usual presentations of [[ETCS]] and [[SEAR]]. 

Dependently sorted set theory is different from [[set-level type theory|set-level]] [[intensional type theories]]. Intensional type theories satisfy the [[propositions as some types]] principle, where every [[proposition]] is a [[set]] and the [[first order logic]] is built out of the type theory itself. On the other hand, dependently sorted set theories are [[first order logic]] over [[dependent type theory]] and keep [[sets]] and [[propositions]] separate.
