## Idea

([Sakharov 67](#Sakharov67)) formulated three conditions jointly necessary for matter/antimatter asymmetry leading to baryogenesis in the early universe. (...)

_Sakharov conditions_

1. violation of baryon number conservation;

1. C and CP violation

1. departure from thermal equilibrium.

One is, obviously, violation of the [[baryon]] [[conservation law]].

This was shown in [t'Hooft 76](#Hooft76):

$$
  \partial_\mu j_b^\mu 
   = 
  \partial_\mu j_L^\mu
   =
  n_f
  \left(
    \frac{g^2}{32 \pi^2}
    W_{\mu \nu}^\alpha \tilde W^{\alpha \mu \nu}
    -
    \frac{{g'}^2}{32\pi^2} F_{\mu \nu}\tilde F^{\mu \nu}
  \right) 
$$


(e.g. [Trodden-Carroll, 4.9.3](#TroddenCarroll), [Shu 08, (7.6)](#Shu08))

the resulting transition between vacua changing particle number are also called _sphaleron transitions_.

That this process was at least one source of baryogenesis in the early universe is plausible but not certain. The process is heavily suppressed by inverse energy and out of reach of conceivable experiments in the present age of the universe.
