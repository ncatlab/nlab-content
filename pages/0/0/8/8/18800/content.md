## Definitions

The _hyperbolic cosine function_ is the [[function]] $\cosh \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ from the [[real numbers]] to themselves which is characterized by the following condition:

1. $\cosh $ is the unique [[solution]] among [[smooth functions]] to the [[differential equation]]/[[initial value problem]]

   $$ 
     cosh '' = cosh 
   $$

   (where a prime indicates the [[derivative]]) subject to the initial conditions 

   $$ 
     \begin{aligned}
       cosh(0) &= 1
       \\
       cosh'(0) & = 0
       \,.
     \end{aligned}
   $$
