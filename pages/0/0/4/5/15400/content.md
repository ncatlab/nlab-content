## Idea

A [[stack]] over the [[site]] of [[complex manifolds]], hence a [[1-truncated]] [[complex analytic ∞-stack]].

Beware that standard terminology such as for _[[algebraic stack]]_ might suggest that a complex analytic stack is a [[geometric stack]] over the complex analytic site, but usage as in ([Behrend-Noohi 05](#BehrendNoohi05)) differs from that would-be convention.

## Examples

For $G$ a [[complex Lie group]] then its [[delooping]] in complex analytic stack is the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$ for holomorphic $G$-[[principal bundles]]. For instance for [[holomorphic vector bundles]] if $G$ is the [[general linear group]] $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$.
