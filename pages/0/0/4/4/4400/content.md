## Definition

A __cpo__ is simply a [[set]] equipped with a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[partial order]].  However, we take as [[morphism|morphisms]] the [[Scott-continuous function]]s ([[continuous functions]] with respect to the [[Scott topology]]).  Cpos and Scott-continuous maps form a category $CPO$.


## Applications

Cpos are important in [[domain theory]].
