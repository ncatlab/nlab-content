Roughly speaking, a factorization system on a category consists of two classes of maps, $L$ and $R$, such that every map factors into an $L$-map followed by an $R$-map, and the $L$-maps and $R$-maps satisfy some lifting or diagonal fill-in property.  The various ways of filling in the details give rise to many kinds of factorization systems:

* In most of the literature, "factorization system" unqualified refers specifically to [[orthogonal factorization system]]s (OFS).

* [[weak factorization system]]s (WFS) are "more general" than orthogonal ones, in the sense that every OFS is also a WFS.  But since the most important examples of WFS (those that occur in [[model category|model categories]] are not OFS, intuitively they are more or less independent concepts.

* [[natural weak factorization system]]s (NWFS) are a strengthened "algebraic" version of WFS in which the factorizations are functorial and the two classes of maps are algebraic.

* In an [[enriched category]] it is natural to consider [[enriched factorization system|enriched (orthogonal) factorization systems]].  The enriched version of WFS falls under [[enriched model category|enriched model categories]].

* In a [[bicategory]] one wants instead "bicategorial factorization systems," which are like Cat-enriched OFS "up to isomorphism," and analogously in an [[n-category]].

* In a [[strict 2-category]] there is also the notion of an [[enhanced factorization system|enhanced (orthogonal) factorization system]], of which the main example is [[bo-ff factorization system|(bo,ff)]] in [[Cat]].

Particular examples of factorization systems of various sorts can be found on the individual pages referred to above.
