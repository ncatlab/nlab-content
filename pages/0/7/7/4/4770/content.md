# The Successor Monad

The successor monad is an example of a [[monad]] on [[Set]]. For $X$ a [[set]], we define $S X$ as a [[disjoint union]] of $S$ and a [[singleton set]] $1$.  Given a [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$, we have $S f\colon S X \to S Y$ as
$$ \begin {matrix} S f(x) \coloneqq f(x) & x\colon X ;\\
                   S f({*}) \coloneqq * & *\colon 1 \end {matrix} $$

In [[material set theory]] (with the [[axiom of foundation]]), it is handy to define this as $S X \coloneq X \cup \{X\}$; then for $f\colon X \to Y$,
$$ S f(x) \coloneqq \left\{ \begin{matrix} f(x) & x \in X \\ Y & x = X \end{matrix} \right .$$
The structure map $\eta_X$ is the [[inclusion function|inclusion]] of $X$ in $S X$; the map $\mu_X\colon S S X \to S X$ [[restriction|restricts]] to $S X$ as the [[identity function|identity]], and futhermore has as [[image]] $\mu_X(S X) = X$.

The [[hom-set]] of morphisms in the [[Kleisli category]] of $(S,\eta,\mu)$ from $X$ to $Y$ is canonically equivalent (using [[excluded middle]]) to the set of [[partial functions]] from $X$ to $Y$; its [[Eilenbergâ€“Moore category]] is equivalent to the category of [[pointed sets]] and [[pointed function]]s, i.e. functions of the form $1 \to X$ and [[commuting squares]] between such functions.

The successor monad as defined here is also interesting in that it stabilizes the finite [[von Neumann ordinals]] and *monotone* maps between them, and that $\eta$ and $\mu$ are also monotone.  Thus the successor monad restricts as a monad to the augmented [[simplex category]].  Furthermore, every monotone map of finite ordinals can be written as a composite of arrows of the form $S^k \mu_l$ and $S^m \eta_n$.  Indeed, the [[monoidal category]] $\Delta_a$ is generated by the [[monoid object]] $0 \overset{\iota_0}\rightarrow 1 \overset{\mu_0}\leftarrow 2$.

[[JCMcKeown]]: I want to say something like $(S,\eta,\mu)$ _generates_ the (skeletal augmented) simplex category; there is surely a right way to say that, but what is it?

_Toby_:  I don\'t think that it\'s quite true that $S$ generates the simplex category, because you need an object to start applying it to.  But I\'d agree that $(S,\eta,\mu)$ generates it starting from $0$.  I don\'t know any slick way to say that.

I\'ve put in a suggestion by Finn above.  How\'s that?
