## Definition

A [[subset]] $S$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is called **saturated** if it is the intersection of its [[open neighborhoods]].

## Properties

* If $X$ is [[T1]], every subset of $X$ is saturated. In particular, every [[singleton]] subset of a [[T1]] space is the [[intersection]] of its [[open neighborhoods]].

* $X$ is not [[T1]] precisely if there exists a non-saturated singleton.
