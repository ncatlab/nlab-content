## Idea

The _[[algebraic K-theory]]_ $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C})$ of a _[[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]_ $\mathcal{C}$ is the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[∞-group completion]] of the [[commutative ∞-monoid]] which is the [[core]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

This construction subsumes various other construction in [[algebraic K-theory]]. Specifically when restricted to 1-categories it reproduces the classical construction by ([Segal 74](#Segal74)) described at _[[K-theory of a permutative category]]_, see [below](#RelationToClassicalAlgebraicKTheory).

## Definition

Write

$$
  \mathcal{K} \;\colon\;  CMon_\infty(\infty Cat) \stackrel{CMon_\infty(core)}{\longrightarrow} CMon_\infty(\infty Gpd) \stackrel{F}{\longrightarrow} AbGrp_\infty(\infty Grpd) \hookrightarrow  Spectra
$$

the composite of

1. the [[core]] functor from [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]] to [[E-∞ spaces]];

1. their [[∞-group completion]] to [[abelian ∞-groups]];

1. the inclusion of "[[abelian ∞-groups]]", hence [[connective spectra]] into all [[spectra]]. 

This $\mathcal{K}$ is the _algebraic K-theory of symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories_. ([Nikolaus 13, below remark 5.3](#Nikolaus13), [Bunke-Nikolaus-V&#246;lkl 13, def.6.1](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13))

More generally, one may start with construction with other objects that map to [[Picard ∞-groups]], such as [[(∞,1)-operads]] ([Nikolaus 13](#Nikolaus13)).

## Properties

### Relation to classical algebraic K-theory
 {#RelationToClassicalAlgebraicKTheory}

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], and $R$[[Mod]] its [[category of modules]] ([[projective modules]]), then $\mathcal{K}(R Mod)$ is Quillen's [[algebraic K-theory]] of $R$.
More generally this reproduces the [[K-theory of a permutative category]] etc. ([Nikolaus 13, section 6](#Nikolaus13)).

## Examples

### On monoidal stacks

Algebraic K-theory is traditionally applied to single [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories|symmetric monoidal]]/[[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-categories]], but to the extent that it is [[(∞,1)-functor|functorial]] it may just as well be applied to [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] with values in these.

Notably, applied to the monoidal [[stack]] of [[vector bundles]] (with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]) on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]], the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|K-theory of a monoidal category]]-functor produces a [[sheaf of spectra]] which is a form of [[differential K-theory]] and whose [[geometric realization]] is the [[topological K-theory]] spectrum. For more on this see at _[differential cohomology hexagon -- Differential K-theory](differential%20cohomology%20diagram#DifferentialKTheory)_.
