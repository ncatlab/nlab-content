## Idea

A morphism $f:A\to B$ in a [[strict 2-category]] $K$ is an **isocofibration** if the corresponding morphism $B\to A$ in $K^{op}$ is an [[isofibration]].

## Examples

In [[Cat]] (and [[Grpd]]), the isocofibrations are the [[functors]] which are [[injective-on-objects functor|injective on objects]].  There they are the [[cofibrations]] in the [[canonical model structure on Cat]] ([[canonical model structure on groupoids|on Grpd]]).  

However, a general 2-category has two candidates for a canonical model structure, one involving the [[isofibrations]] and one the isocofibrations, and in general the two may not be the same.
