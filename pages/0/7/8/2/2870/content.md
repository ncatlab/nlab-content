[[Nikolai Durov]] constructed [[spectrum (geometry)|spectra]] of commutative [[finitary monads]] (cf. [[commutative algebraic theory]]) which he calls generalized (commutative) [[commutative ring|rings]]; using a class of categorically defined [[localizations]] (which for some strange reason he calls pseudolocalizations), he glues such spectra to obtain __generalized [[schemes]]__ which are a class of [[generalized ringed space]]s.
