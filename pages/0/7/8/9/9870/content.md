## Idea

A _Baum-Douglas geometric cycle_ on a given [[manifold]] $X$ is a representative for [[K-homology]] classes on $X$. It is given by a [[submanifold]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$ equipped with [[spin^c structure]] and with a [[complex vector bundle]]. The [[equivalence relation]] identifying such data that represents the same [[K-homology]] class includes a compatible [[bordism]] relation. 

Viewed as a [[correspondence]] of the form

$$
  X \stackrel{}{\leftarrow} (Q,E) \to \ast
$$

a Baum-Douglas geometric cycle is a special case of the spans that represent classes in [[KK-theory]] (between manifolds) according to ([Connes-Skandalis 84, section 3](#ConnesSkandalis84)).

In [[string theory]] Baum-Douglas cycles constitute one formalization of the concept of [[D-brane]] carrying a [[Chan-Paton gauge field]] ([Reis-Szabo 05](#ReisSzabo05), [Szabo 08](#Szabo08)): the submanifold $Q$ represents the [[worldvolume]] of the D-brane and the [[complex vector bundle]] it carries the [[Chan-Paton gauge field]].
