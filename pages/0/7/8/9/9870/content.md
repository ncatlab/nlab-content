## Idea

For a given [[manifold]] $X$ a _Baum-Douglas geoemtric cycle_ on $X$ is data consisting of a [[submanifold]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$ vcarrying a [[vector bundle]] $E\to X$ such that this represents a class in [[K-homology]] under a suitable [[equivalence relation]].

Viewed as a [[correspondence]] of the form

$$
  X \stackrel{}{\leftarrow} (Q,E) \to \ast
$$

a Baum-Douglas geometric cycle is a special case of the spans that represent classes in [[KK-theory]] (between manifolds) according to [Connes-Skandalis 84, section 3](#ConnesSkandalis84)
