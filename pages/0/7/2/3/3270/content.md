## Overview

In study of solitons, one can try a WKB-style approximation to nonlinear wave equation (cf. eikonal equation, [[Maslov index]] etc.). Stokes has observed that when trying to connect the local solutions, one has discontinuities along certain lines, now called **Stokes lines**. This is called the [[Stokes phenomenon]]. Similar issues appear in study of [[isomonodromic deformation]]s of nonlinear ODE-s in complex plane, what is also relevant in [[soliton]] theory, and [[integrable systems]], and special functions like [[Painlevé transcendent]]s. This has especially much been studied by Kyoto school (Jimbo, Miwa, Sato, [[Masaki Kashiwara|Kashiwara]] etc.), including using [[D-modules]] and [[microlocal analysis]]. Kyoto school found a connection of isomonodromic theory to the so-called [[holonomic quantum field]]s. 

The solutions of meromorphic differential equations can be expressed in terms of [[meromorphic connection]]s. Then the slopes related to the solutions can be viewed as features of particular objects in a category of [[D-module|$D$-modules]]. More generally, slope filtrations are structures which appear in many other additive categories, e.g. in [[Hodge theory]], theory of Dieudonn&#233; modules and so on. Many of those are related to the stability of the objects, which is important in the construction of moduli spaces. 

In [[algebraic geometry]], [[Grothendieck]] has shown how to correctly define and construct some fundamental moduli spaces, like Hilbert schemes and Quot schemes for [[coherent sheaves]]. The work has been continued by [[David Mumford]] who geometrized classical invariant theory into [[geometric invariant theory]]. To keep moduli under control, one needs to impose stability conditions on objects and also look at classes with some fixed data: those involve slopes or equivalently phase factors. This is thus  similar to the phases of eikonal in the case of Stokes phenomenon. 
Cf. also Harder-Narasimhan filtration, [[Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity]] (cf. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo%E2%80%93Mumford_regularity)) etc. 

In some physical situations solutions can be quite constrained by some special symmetry or representation theoretic conditions. One example are [[BPS state|BPS states]], which can be often counted or measured in some way. Another example are the moduli spaces of [[Higgs bundle]]s, studied by [[Carlos Simpson]] and others, which have special cases with interpretations both in geometry and in the gauge theory (instantons). It appears that sometimes they can be linked to the geometric picture. [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]], spectral transform and similar correspondences again play a major role. 

Surely, one often works at the derived level. An adaptation of the  notion of stability into the setup of [[triangulated categories]] has been introduced by Bridgeland. Bridgeland stability for the derived categories of (boundary conditions of) D-branes (B-model) are relevant for string theory.

## Another wall crossing: representation theory

We should also mention the related wall crossing in [[representation theory]]. Symmetries related to Weyl groups, Weyl chambers and chamber walls are involved (what is sometimes also in BPS setup above, see the paper by Cheng and Verlinde below). A priori wall crossing functors in representation theory (introduced in 1970s by Russian school, Gelfand, Bernstein etc.) are about certain functors which in take as input an infinite-dimensional representation, tensor it with finite-dimensional and look for certain pieces in the decomposition, where the business of chamber walls is crucial.

Ginzburg]], _Wall-crossing functors and $D$-modules_, Representation Theory __3__ (electronic), 1--31 (1999) [pdf](http://www.ams.org/ert/1999-003-01/S1088-4165-99-00063-1/S1088-4165-99-00063-1.pdf).
