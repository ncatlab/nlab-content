For the different notions of the same name in [[Morse theory]] see at _[[Cerf wall crossing]]_ and for the (Weyl chamber wall) crossing functors in representation theory see [[wall crossing functor]].

## Overview

In the study of [[solitons]], one may try a [[WKB approximation|WKB-style approximation]] to a nonlinear [[wave equation]] (see also _[[eikonal equation]]_, _[[Maslov index]]_, etc.). Stokes has observed that when trying to connect the local solutions, one has discontinuities along certain lines, now called **Stokes lines**. This is called the [[Stokes phenomenon]]. Similar issues appear in study of [[isomonodromic deformation]]s of nonlinear [[ODEs]] in the [[complex plane]], which is also relevant in [[soliton]] theory, and [[integrable systems]], and special functions like [[Painlev√© transcendent]]s. This has especially been studied by the Kyoto school (Jimbo, Miwa, Sato, [[Masaki Kashiwara|Kashiwara]] etc.), including the use of [[D-modules]] and [[microlocal analysis]]. The Kyoto school found a connection of isomonodromic theory to what is called [[holonomic quantum field]]s. 

The solutions of meromorphic differential equations can be expressed in terms of [[meromorphic connection]]s. Then the slopes related to the solutions can be viewed as features of particular objects in a category of $D$-[[D-module|modules]]. More generally, slope filtrations are structures which appear in many other additive categories, e.g. in [[Hodge theory]], theory of Dieudonn&#233; modules and so on. Many of those are related to the stability of the objects, which is important in the construction of [[moduli spaces]]. 

In [[algebraic geometry]], [[Grothendieck]] has shown how to correctly define and construct some fundamental [[moduli spaces]], like Hilbert schemes and Quot schemes for [[coherent sheaves]]. The work has been continued by [[David Mumford]] who geometrized classical invariant theory into [[geometric invariant theory]]. To keep moduli under control, one needs to impose stability conditions on objects and also look at classes with some fixed data: those involve slopes or equivalently phase factors. This is thus  similar to the phases of eikonal in the case of Stokes phenomenon. 
Cf. also Harder-Narasimhan filtration, [[Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity]] (cf. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo%E2%80%93Mumford_regularity)) etc. 

### In supersymmetric field theory

In [[super Yang-Mills theory]] the number of [[BPS states]] is locally constant as a function of the parameters of the theory, but it may jump at certain "walls" in the [[moduli spaces]] of parameters. The precise behaviour of the BPS states as one crosses these walls is studied as "wall crossing phenomena". 

Another example are the [[moduli spaces]] of [[Higgs bundles]], studied by [[Carlos Simpson]] and others, which have special cases with interpretations both in geometry and in the gauge theory (instantons). It appears that sometimes they can be linked to the geometric picture. [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]], spectral transform and similar correspondences again play a major role. 

Surely, one often works at the derived level. An adaptation of the  notion of stability into the setup of [[triangulated categories]] has been introduced by Bridgeland. Bridgeland stability for the derived categories of (boundary conditions of) D-branes (B-model) are relevant for string theory.
