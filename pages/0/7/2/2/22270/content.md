## Definition

An [[orbifold]] $\mathcal{X}$ is called _good_ ([Thurston 92, Ch. 13, Def. 13.2.3](#Thurston92)) or _developable_ if it is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[global quotient orbifold|global quotient]] of a [[smooth manifold]] $M$ by the [[action]] of a [[discrete group]] $\flat G$ (not necessarily [[finite group|finite]]):

$$
  \mathcal{X} \,\simeq\, M \sslash \flat G
$$

Otherwise $\mathcal{X}$ is called _bad_.

If $\mathcal{X}$ is even the [[global quotient orbifold|global quotient]] of a [[smooth manifold]] by a [[finite group]] [[group action|action]] one says that it is _very good_.

In the other direction, an orbifold that is the [[global quotient orbifold|global quotient]] of a [[smooth manifold]] by some ([[compact Lie group|compact]]) [[Lie group]]  is called a *[[presentable orbifold]]*.
