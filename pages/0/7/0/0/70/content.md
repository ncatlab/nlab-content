The term _$\omega$-category_ is used more or less synonymous with [[infinity-category]], though the two terms appear with different frequency in different parts of the literature.

Originally, $\omega$-categories were introduced as

* [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]].

There are also 

* [[weak omega-category|weak omega-categories]].

We had some discussion on the use of terminology, which 
is archived [[discussion on terminology -- omega-category|here]].
