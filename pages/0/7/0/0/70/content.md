$\omega$-Categories are precisely those [[globular set|globular]] [[higher category theory|infinity-categories]] which are _strict_.

[[Toby Bartels]]: Who actually uses the language this way? If anything, it should be the reverse, as 'omega' is Greek (like 'bi', 'tri', and 'tetra') and 'infinity' is not.  

[[John Baez]]: For a long time, for most category theorists  the default meaning of '$n$-category' has been 'strict globular $n$-category', so when Street invented '$\omega$-categories' in his paper on orientals, he meant 'globular strict $\infty$-categories'.  Now terminology is in flux and people like [[Tom Leinster]] and myself advocate a new system in which '$n$-category' means 'some sort of possibly weak $n$-category' &#8212; at least until one has defined it more precisely in a specific context.

We may want to discuss whether the $n$Lab adopts traditional terminology, or takes this historic opportunity to play Bourbaki and choose consistent terminology for the future use (while still explaining the traditional terms).  In any event, globular strict $\omega$-categories are worth talking about!

This means that 

 * all composition operations are strictly associative;

 * all composition operations strictly commute with all others (strict [[exchange law]]s);

 * all identity $k$-morphisms are strict identies under all compositons.

#Definition#

...

#Literature#

$\omega$-categories were introduced, together with [[oriental]]s, in 

* Ross Street, _The algebra of oriented simplices_,
J. Pure Appl. Algebra 49 (1987) 283-335; MR89a:18019 ([pdf](http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/aos.pdf)).
