$\omega$-Categories are precisely those [[globular set|globular]] [[higher category theory|infinity-categories]] which are _strict_.

[[Toby Bartels]]: Who actually uses the language this way? If anything, it should be the reverse, as 'omega' is Greek (like 'bi', 'tri', and 'tetra') and 'infinity' is not.  

[[John Baez]]: For a long time, for most category theorists, the default meaning of '$n$-category' has been 'strict globular $n$-category' &#8212; especially since weak $n$-categories had not yet been defined (except for very low $n$).   So when Street invented '$\omega$-categories' in his paper on orientals, he meant 'globular strict $\infty$-categories'.  Now there are many definitions of 'weak $n$-category', terminology is in flux, and people like [[Tom Leinster]] and myself advocate a new system in which '$n$-category' means 'some sort of possibly weak $n$-category' &#8212; at least until one has defined it more precisely in a specific context.  It is still true that most papers referring to $\omega$-categories mean 'globular strict $\infty$-categories'.

We may want to discuss whether the $n$Lab adopts traditional terminology, or takes this historic opportunity to play Bourbaki and choose consistent terminology for the future (while still explaining the traditional terms, or course).  In any event, globular strict $\omega$-categories are worth talking about, and that's what this page is about!

[[Toby Bartels]]: I agree with you and Tom about '$n$-category', and I agree that the strict globular case is worth talking about. I only question making a terminological distinction between '$\omega$-category' for the strict globular concept and '$\infty$-category' for the general weak case; (this seems to go against both the Greek-prefixes-for-the-weak-concept convention *and* the usual-name-for-the-weak-concept convention!). And I'm wondering if this distinction is established somewhere.

This means that 

 * all composition operations are strictly associative;

 * all composition operations strictly commute with all others (strict [[exchange law]]s);

 * all identity $k$-morphisms are strict identies under all compositons.

#Definition#

#Literature#

$\omega$-categories were introduced, together with [[oriental]]s, in

J. Pure Appl. Algebra 49 (1987) 283-335; MR89a:18019 ([pdf](http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/aos.pdf)).
