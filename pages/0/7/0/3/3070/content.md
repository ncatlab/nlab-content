A _symmetric monoidal natural transformation_ is a [[natural transformation]] between [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric monoidal functors]] that respects the symmetric monoidal structure.

In fact, a symmetric monoidal natural transformation is the same as a [[monoidal natural transformation]] (as long as it goes between symmetric monoidal functors).

See, for example,
