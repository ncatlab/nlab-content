## Idea

The [[Coleman theorem]] says that the only possible [[symmetry]] [[Lie algebra]] of the [[S-matrix]] of a 4-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] with [[mass gap]] is a [[direct sum]] of the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] and some other Lie algebra of internal [[gauge equivalence|gauge]] symmetries, hence that there cannot be a non-trivial mixing between the [[spacetime]] symmetry and the internal symmetry at the level of [[Lie algebras]] and in the presence of a [[mass gap]].

(This applies to fundamental [[local symmetry]] of the [[S-matrix]], not to [[global symmetry]] after [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].)

The theorem of [Haag&#8211;&#321;opusza&#324;ski&#8211;Sohnius 75](#HaagSohniuLopuszanski75) makes the analogous statement for [[super Lie algebras]]: the only possible [[super Lie algebra]] symmetry of an [[S-matrix]] is a [[direct sum]] of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] ("[[supersymmetry]]") and another super Lie algebra.

Notice that the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] itself does mix the plain bosonic [[Poincare Lie algebra]] symmetry with a kind of "internal" symmetry, see also at [[extended supersymmetry]].
