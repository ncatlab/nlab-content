**Lev Sem&#1105;novi&#269; Pontrjagin** (&#1051;&#1077;&#1074; &#1057;&#1077;&#1084;&#1105;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1055;&#1086;&#1085;&#1090;&#1088;&#1103;&#1075;&#1080;&#1085;) was an influential Soviet mathematician working in Moscow. His main works till late 1940-s were in topology, especially study of topological groups (including study of [[Pontrjagin duality]]) and algebraic topology in which he explored also methods of differentiable manifolds for computations of homotopy groups. After the success of French school in late 1940s introducing new methods of sheaf theory which he did not like as less direct than the more intuitive geometric methods he was master of, and after some pressure from the government, Pontrjagin switched into applied mathematics where he made some fundamental works, especially in optimization theory.  

Pontrjagin was a full member of Soviet Academy. He was blind since the age of 14.
