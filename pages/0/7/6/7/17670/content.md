## Idea

The _Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model_ (often called just _Connes-Lott model_) is a [[spectral triple]] that spectrally encodes a [[spacetime]] which is the [[product]] of 4d [[Minkowski spacetime]] $X$ with a an exotic [[non-commutative geometry]] space $F$ whose classical dimension is that of a point, but which has [[KO-dimension]] 6 (mod 8). Hence this is a non-commutative version of a [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of a spacetime of [[KO-dimension]] $4 + 6$. (See also the discussion at _[[2-spectral triple]]_).

As in all ([[supersymmetry|super]]-)[[KK-compactification|Kaluza-Klein theory]], what is pure [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]] (albeit "[[spectral geometry|spectral]]") in 4+6 (KO-)dimension, hence pure [[gravity]], effectively looks like a configuration of [[Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory]] down in 4 dimensions, hence of [[gravity]] coupled to [[gauge fields]] and [[fermions]] and a [[Higgs boson]].

The interest in the model lies in the fact that a comparatively simple algebraic choice in the spectral triple of the Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model this way reproduces the [[standard model of particle physics]], and does so in quite some fine detail (even if some issues remain open).

For instance the fiber space $F$ is modeled as the formal dual to the algebra 

$$
  \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{H}_L \oplus \mathbb{H}_R \oplus M_3(\mathbb{C})
$$

which is the [[direct sum]] of the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebras]] of [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]] and $3x3$ complex [[matrices|matrix algebra]].

Moreover, the entire field content in one generation of [[fermions]] (i.e. [[electrons]], [[quarks]], [[neutrinos]]) is claimed to be encoded precisely in the [[bimodule]] over this algebra which is the direct sum of all inequivalent irreducible odd bimodules ([Connes 06, prop. 2.2 - prop 2.5](#Connes06))
