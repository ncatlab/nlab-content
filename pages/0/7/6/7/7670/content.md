__Shelah's categoricity conjecture.__ Let $T$ be a countable theory in $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ (cf. [[infinitary logic]]). If there exists $\lambda\geq\beth_{\omega_1}$ such that the number of isomorphism classes of models in cardinality $\lambda$ is $I(\lambda,T) = 1$ then $I(\mu,T) = 1$ holds for every
$\mu\geq\beth_{\omega_1}$. More generally, let  $K = (K,\lt)$ be an [[abstract elementary class]]. If there exists $\lambda\geq|2^{LS(K)}|$ such that the number of isomorphism classes of models in cardinality $\lambda$ is $I(\lambda,K) = 1$ then $I(\mu,K) = 1$ holds for every
$\mu\geq|2^{LS(K)}|$.
