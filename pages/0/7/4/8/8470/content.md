## Idea

In traditional mathematics and [[set theory]], the [[category]] [[Set]] of all [[sets]] is the archetypical [[topos]]. However, in [[predicative mathematics]] with its notion of sets, these do not form a topos since they do not satisfy the [[powerset axiom]]. In [[constructive mathematics]], we may be *weakly* predicative and *almost* form a topos; the resulting weaker structure which [[Bishop sets]] (for example) form is a  _predicative topos_ ([van den Berg](#vdBerg)).  

## Definition

There are various notions of predicative topos in the literature (see references below); here we discuss the notion advocated by [[Benno van den Berg]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **predicative topos** is a [[ΠW-pretopos]] satisfying [[WISC]].

=--

This is ([van den Berg, def. 6.1](#vdBerg)), who however calls what we call WISC the "axiom of multiple choice", and the usual [[axiom of multiple choice]] the "strong axiom of multiple choice".


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In other words, the [[axiom of multiple choice]] appears in different strengths in the literature; see at _[[WISC]]_. Accordingly there is the notion of strong/weak predicative topos if it satisfies the strong/weak version of this axiom; van den Berg's notion of predicative topos is the weak version.

=--

Note that an impredicative [[elementary topos]] is *not* necessarily a predicative topos in this sense.  A topos is always a $\Pi$-pretopos, and if it has an [[NNO]] then it is a $\Pi W$-pretopos, but it need not satisfy WISC ([Roberts 2015]({#Roberts15})).

A different approach to a notion of predicative topos is to assert, rather than a weak choice principle, the existence of some categorical version of [[higher inductive types]].  But this would also exclude some elementary toposes.


## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

A [[category]] of [[internal sheaves]] over an [[internal site]] in a predicative topos is again a predicative topos.

=--

This is ([van den Berg, theorem 7.5](#vdBerg)), using [vdBerg-Moerdijk, theorem 4.21](#vdBergMoerdijk)


## Examples

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

The [[category]] of [[Bishop sets]] in [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]] is a [strong predicative topos.

=--

This is ([van den Berg, theorem 6.2](#vdBerg)), based on ([Moerdijk-Palmgren 99, section 7](#MoerdijkPalmgren99)) and ([Moerdijk-Palmgren 00, section 10](#MoerdijkPalmgren00)).

Not every [[topos]] is a predicative topos, or even every $Set$-topos (i.e. a topos with a [[geometric morphism]] to the category $Set$, see ([Roberts 2015](#Roberts15))), but every _[[Grothendieck topos]]_ -- a [[bounded geometric morphism|bounded]] $Set$-topos -- is.
