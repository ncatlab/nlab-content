## Idea

By a _tensor meson_ the literature typically means a type of [[meson]] whose [[Wigner classification]] is a [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]]-[[spin group]] spin-2 [[linear representation|representation]], hence given by a symmetric rank-2 [[tensor]].

Indeed, in the [[AdS/QCD correspondence]] these "tensor mesons" are [[AdS/CFT duality|dual]] to [[graviton]]-modes in the $\sim$ [[bulk spacetime]].

Beware that there are also [[mesons]] given by _anti_-symmetric rank-2 tensors (the [[h1-meson]] and [[b1-meson]]), but since these are "spin-1", they are counted as [[vector mesons]].

More generally, there are [[higher spin mesons]], which hence could also be called "tensor mesons".
