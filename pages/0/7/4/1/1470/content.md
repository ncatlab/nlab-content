An **algebraic stack** denotes either a [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] or more general [[Artin stack]] in the traditional setup of algebraic spaces: they are (Grothendieck) 1-stacks of groupoids on the &#233;tale site satisfying additional representability conditions, namely an algebraic stack $X$ is required to have an atlas $A\to X$ by an [[algebraic space]] or in a stronger version by a scheme $A$; the morphisms of the cover are required to be

* surjective representable and &#233;tale (Deligne-Mumford stack);

* surjective representable and smooth (Artin stack).

Here we used the following definition.  A map $f:X\to Y$ of 1-stacks on the &#233;tale site is *representable* if for any scheme $S$ the fiber product $S\times_Y X$ is a stack associated to a scheme. Let $P$ be a property stable under composition and pullback. A representable map $f:X\to Y$ of stacks is said to have a property $P$ if for any scheme $S$ and a morphism of 1-stacks $S\to Y$ the pullback $S\times_Y X\to X$ has property $P$.  

Nowdays people talk about differentiable stacks and topological stacks meaning analogues of Deligne-Mumford (DM) or Artin stacks defined in the setup of the category of manifolds or some convenient category of topological spaces. Orbifolds are an example of an Artin stack. For orbifolds stabilizer groups are finite, while for Artin stacks in general they are algebraic groups. An important source of DM-stacks are moduli problems, resulting often in moduli stacks (or their derived versions). DM-stacks are introduced in
