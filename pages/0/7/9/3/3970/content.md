## Idea

The generalization of the notion of [[accessible functor]]  from [[category theory]] to  [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition


An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **accessible** if $C$ is an [[accessible (∞,1)-category]] and there is a [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ such that $F$ preserves $\kappa$-small [[filtered colimit]]s.

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.4.2.5]].


## Properties

###### Definition

If an $(\infty,1)$-functor between [[accessible (∞,1)-categories]] has a left or right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]], then it is itself accessible.

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 5.4.7.7]].
