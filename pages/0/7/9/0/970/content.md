A **large category** is a [[category]] which is not [[small category|small]].

Many tools and results about small categories, in particular concerning [[limit]]s indexed by such a category, fail for large categories. There are various notions and techniques to deal with this problem and reduce or relate large categories to small categories as much as possible:

* In the simplest case the large category is *essentially* small in that it is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[small category]].  Then (for all non-[[evil]] purposes) you can simply replace it with a small category.

* Many large categories that arise in practice are (even essentially) large but still *accessible*.  An [[accessible category]] is a large category which behaves like the category of [[ind-object]]s of a small category and is therefore, while itself large, entirely governed by a small category.

I\'m inclined to redirect this page to [[small category]] (which is where I make most links from 'large' or 'large category' in the wiki).  On the other hand, we could expand this page with techniques to deal with large categories, much like at [[large site]].  ---Toby

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Yes, we should point from here to [[accessible category]], in particular.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I'm not sure how a "redirect" would be functionally very different from what is currently on this page, except that if it isn't labeled a redirect then people may feel more free to add other things like what Urs suggests.

I have to say, I don't really understand your (Toby's) philosophy that inclines you to draw a distinction between [[poset]] and [[partial order]], but make [[large category]] redirect to [[small category]].  But possibly my philosophy is as incomprehensible to you.   (-:

_Toby_:  The functional question is whether we should make links like `[[small category|large category]]` or `[[large category]]`.  The latter is unfriendly to the reader if this page is (functionally equivalent to) a redirect.  But it is better if things are added to this page.  As that seems likely now, I\'m happy and will make links in the latter style.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I added a paragraph with more discussion to the above entry.

_Toby_:  Looks good.  I did redirect [[essentially small category]] to [[small category]] on the grounds that they\'re actually equivalent; but if there\'s anything special to say on the former, you can undo that.
