A **large category** is a [[category]] which is not [[small category|small]].

See also: [[foundations]], [[locally small category]].

I\'m inclined to redirect this page to [[small category]] (which is where I make most links from 'large' or 'large category' in the wiki).  On the other hand, we could expand this page with techniques to deal with large categories, much like at [[large site]].  ---Toby

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Yes, we should point from here to [[accessible category]], in particular.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I'm not sure how a "redirect" would be functionally very different from what is currently on this page, except that if it isn't labeled a redirect then people may feel more free to add other things like what Urs suggests.

I have to say, I don't really understand your (Toby's) philosophy that inclines you to draw a distinction between [[poset]] and [[partial order]], but make [[large category]] redirect to [[small category]].  But possibly my philosophy is as incomprehensible to you.   (-:
