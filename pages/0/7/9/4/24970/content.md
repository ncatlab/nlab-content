## Idea

The _relative Langlands program_ is a generalization of the [[Langlands program]] that is phrased in terms of [[spherical varieties]] instead of directly in terms of [[reductive groups]]. It is expected to recover the usual Langlands program in the group case. In more recent work, instead of focusing on a spherical variety $X$, the main focus is on a Hamiltonian $G$-space $M$, which is often related to $X$ via $M=T^{*}X$. The tools of [[geometric quantization]] can then be used, with $M$ playing the role of the classical phase space to be quantized.

Recent ongoing work by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh attempt to relate it to [[topological quantum field theory]] (as inspired by both the [[Kapustin-Witten TQFT]] as well as the analogies of [[arithmetic topology]]). This is expected as well to illuminate topics in special values of [[L-functions]].

## Quantization in the relative Langlands program

Let $F$ be our base global field and let $G$ be our reductive group. Locally, the idea of "quantization" in the relative Langlands program refers to obtaining a unitary representation $\omega_{v}$ of $G(F_{v})$ out of the Hamiltonian $G$-space $M$, analogous to the theory of [[geometric quantization]]. We also want a "base vector" $\Phi_{v}^{0}\in \omega_{v}$ for almost all $v$. Globally, we want to put together these local representations and have an automorphic realization $\otimes'\omega_{v}\to C^{\infty}(G(F)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}_{F}))$. An example of this is given by the [[Weil representation]] and the formation of [[theta series]].
