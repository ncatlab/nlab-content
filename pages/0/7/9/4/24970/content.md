## Idea

The _relative Langlands program_ is a generalization of the [[Langlands program]] that is phrased in terms of [[spherical varieties]] instead of directly in terms of [[reductive groups]]. It is expected to recover the usual Langlands program in the group case.

Recent ongoing work by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh attempt to relate it to [[topological quantum field theory]] (as inspired by both the [[Kapustin-Witten TQFT]] as well as the analogies of [[arithmetic topology]]). This is expected as well to illuminate topics in special values of [[L-functions]].
