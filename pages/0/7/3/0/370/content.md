A **quasi-isomorphism** is a morphism between [[chain complex|chain complexes]] which induces an isomorphism on [[homology]].  Quasi-isomorphisms are also called, more descriptively, **homology isomorphisms** or **$H_*$-isomorphisms**.  They are the weak equivalences in the most common [[model category|model structures]] on chain complexes.
