Given a [[space]] $X$, a [[subspace]] of $X$ is __dense__ if its [[closed subspace|closure]] is all of $X$.

In [[locale]] theory, we have the curious property that any [[intersection]] of dense subspaces is still dense.  (This of course fails rather badly for [[topological spaces]].)  One consequence is that every locale has a smallest dense sublocale, the [[double negation sublocale]].

In point-set topology, a space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if it has a dense subspace with [[countable set|countably]] many points.
