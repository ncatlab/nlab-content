For a given geometric theory $T$, a classifying topos for $T$ is a Grothendieck topos $E[T]$ equipped with a "universal model $U$ of $T$". This means that for any Grothendieck topos $E$ together with a model $X$ of $T$ in $E$, there exists a (unique up to isomorphism) left exact left adjoint $f^*: E[T] \to E$ which maps the model $U$ to the model $X$. More precisely, for any Grothendieck topos $E$, the category of $T$-models in $E$ is equivalent to the category of left exact left adjoints $E[T] \to E$ and natural transformations between them. 

Any [[topos]] can be thought of as a 'classifying topos'.
