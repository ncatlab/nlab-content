For a given [[geometric theory]] $T$, a **classifying topos** for $T$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]] $S[T]$ equipped with a "universal model $U$ of $T$".  This means that for any Grothendieck topos $E$ together with a model $X$ of $T$ in $E$, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) [[geometric morphism]] $f: E \to S[T]$ such that $f^*$ maps the $T$-model $U$ to the model $X$.  More precisely, for any Grothendieck topos $E$, the category of $T$-models in $E$ is equivalent to the category of geometric morphisms $E \to S[T]$.

Any [[Grothendieck topos]] can be thought of as a 'classifying topos'. A useful discussion of this idea starts
[here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/10/geometric_representation_theor_2.html#c012724).

Classifying toposes can also be defined over any base topos $S$ instead of [[Set]].  In that case "Grothendieck topos" is replaced by "bounded $S$-topos."
