# The indivisible stochastic process interpretation of quantum physics

## Idea

Indivisible [[stochastic processes]] generically exhibit all the hallmark empirical features of quantum systems, including [[quantum interference]], [[decoherence]], [[entanglement]], and noncommutative observables.  Moreover an indivisible [[stochastic process]] can replicate all the empirical predictions made by the [[Hilbert space]] formalism for [[quantum mechanics]], while avoiding the famous measurement problem.  Consequently one can view any quantum system as an indivisible stochastic process yielding the indivisible stochastic process interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]].  Going in the other logical direction, one can also represent indivisible stochastic processes in the usual [[Hilbert space]] formalism yielding a bijective correspondence between indivisible stochastic process systems and quantum systems.
