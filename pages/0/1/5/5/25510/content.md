## Idea

Various structures in [[algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]] have a classification into 10 classes, more or less explicitly related to the 2 + 8 [[topological K-theory]]-[[groups]] of the [[point]] up to [[Bott periodicity]]: 2 for [[KU]] and 8 for [[KO]], which are unified in [[KR]].

The specific term "10-fold way" is a variation of the term "threefold way" used in [Dyson (1962)](#Dyson62), which is referred to as inspiration by [Heinzner, Huckleberry & Zirnbauer (2004)](#HHZ04) and [Zirnbauer (2010)](#Z10) in reference to work going back to [Altland & Zirnbauer (1997)](#AZ97). While the term "10-fold way" is now often attributed to these authors, they may not actually have used it as a term ([Zirnbauer (2010)](#Z10) finally speaks of the "10-way", at least).

The term became rather popular in the wake of the seminal suggestion by [Kitaev (2009)](#Kitaev09) that "free" [[topological phases of matter]], specifically free [[crystalline topological insulator|crystalline]] [[topological insulator]]-phases,  are classified by some form of [[topological K-theory]] (though [Kitaev (2009)](#Kitaev09) does not use the term "10-fold way", either): see at *[[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]* for more on this.

Kitaev's suggestion was made more precise by [Freed & Moore (2013)](#FreedMoore13) (who, however and ironically, doubted, on [p. 57](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5055.pdf#page=57), its application to topological phases -- but see [pp. 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13563.pdf#page=2) of [SS23](K-theory+classification+of+topological+phases+of+matter#SatiSchreiber23) for resolution) and it is these authors who very much amplify (and may have actually coined) the term "10-fold way". Moreover, they point out ([pp. 75](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5055.pdf#page=75)) that a 10-fold classification is already contained in [Dyson (1962)](#Dyson62)(!), which the authors re-interpret as the classification of [[super division algebras]]. 

This 10-fold way of [[super-division algebras]] is further amplified in &lbrack;[Moore (2013), p. 129](#Moore13)&rbrack; and [Geiko & Moore (2021)](#GeikoMoore2021)
