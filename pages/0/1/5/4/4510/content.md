In [[homological algebra]] $Ext$ is one of the most important (bi)functors. 

Given an **abelian category** $A$ the bifunctor $Hom_A : A^{op}\times A\to Ab$ can be considered as a functor either in first or in second variable, and compute the corresponding right derived functors. If they exist, the classical right derived functors of either functor agree and also agree with the homology of the mixed double complex obtained by taking simultaneously an injective [[resolution]] of the first contravariant argument and projective resolution of the second covariant argument. The last construction is called the balanced $Ext$.

Alternatively, one can consider the derived category and define 

$$
Ext^i(M,N) := Hom_{D(A)}(M,N[i])
$$

or define $Ext^i$-groups as groups of extensions of length $i$.
