## Idea

When working with [[locally presentable categories]], one is typically interested only in the [[colimit]]-[[preserved limit|preserving]] [[functors]] between them, hence (by the [[adjoint functor theorem]]) equivalently the [[left adjoint]] functors. 

One hence considers the [[very large category]] $PrCat$ whose objects are [[locally presentable categories]], and whose morphisms are [[left adjoint functors]].

The analog of this 

* in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] is [[Pr(∞,1)Cat]];

* in [[model category]]-theory is [[Ho(CombModCat)]].
