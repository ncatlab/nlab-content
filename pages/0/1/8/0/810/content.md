The [[cubical set|cubical singular complex]] $K X$, or $S^\square X$, of a topological space $X$ has an additional structure of compositions. 

Let $(m) = (m_1, \ldots\, , m_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of positive integers
and

$$\phi_{(m)} : I^n \rightarrow [0, m_1] \times \cdots \times [0,
m_n]$$ 

be the map $(x_1 , \ldots \, , x_n) \mapsto (m_1 x_1, \ldots  \, ,
m_n x_n).$ Then a _subdivision of type $(m)$_  of a map $\alpha : I^n
\rightarrow X$ is a factorisation $\alpha = \alpha' \circ
\phi_{(m)}$; its  _parts_ are the cubes $\alpha_{(r)}$ where
$(r) = (r_1, \ldots \,, r_n)$ is an $n$-tuple of integers with $1
\leq r_i \leq m_i$, $i = 1, \ldots\, , n,$ and where
$\alpha_{(r)} : I^n \rightarrow X$ is given by

$$(x_1, \ldots \, , x_n) \mapsto
\alpha'(x_1 + r_1 - 1, \ldots \, , x_n + r_n - 1).$$

We then say that $\alpha$ is the _composite_  of the cubes $\alpha_{(r)}$ and write
$\alpha = [\alpha_{(r)}]$. The _domain_ of $\alpha_{(r)}$ is
then the set $\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in I^n : r_i-1 \leq x_i
\leq r_i, 1 \leq i \leq n\}$.

The composite is _in direction_ $j$  if $m_j$ is the only
$m_i \gt 1,$ and we then write $\alpha = [\alpha_1 , \ldots\, ,
\alpha_m{_j} ]_j;$ the composite is _in the directions_ $j$,
$k$ $(j \neq k)$  if $m_j$, $m_k$ are the only $m_i \gt 1,$ and we then write

$$\alpha = [ \alpha_{rs}]_{j,k} \quad  or \quad  [ \alpha_{rs}] \quad  _{j}\!\downarrow ^{\textstyle\to ^k} $$

for $r = 1 , \ldots\, , m_j$ and $s = 1, \ldots \,, m_k.$ The aim is to follow matrix conventions in writing double compositions. 

These definitions and notations are useful for showing how the singular cubical complex allows expression for _algebraic inverses to subdivision_, something seemingly very difficult either simplicially or globularly. The implications of this advantage for weak category theory seem not to have been investigated. 


A _cubical set with connections and compositions and inverses_ is a cubical
set $K$ with connections in which each $K_n$ has $n$ partial
compositions $+_i$ and $n$ unary operations $-_i$, $i =
1,2,\ldots \, ,n$ satisfying the following axioms.

 If $a,b \in K_n$, then $a+_i b$ is defined if and only if  $ \partial^+_i a=\partial^-_i  b
$, and then for $\alpha=\pm$:

$$ \begin{cases} \partial^-_i (a+_i b) = \partial^-_i a & \\
         \partial^+_i (a+_i b) = \partial^+_i b & \end{cases}$$

$$
 \partial^\alpha_i (a +_j b) = \begin{cases} \partial^\alpha_i a+_{j-1}\partial^\alpha_i b &(i \lt j) \\
         \partial^\alpha_i a+_j \partial^\alpha_i b& (i \gt j), \end{cases}
          $$

 If $a \in K_n$, then $-_i a$ is defined and

$$
\begin{cases}\partial^-_i (-_i a)=\partial^+_i a & \\ \partial^+_i(-_i a)=\partial^-_i a &
\end{cases} $$

$$
 \partial^\alpha_i(-_j a) = \begin{cases} -_{j-1}\partial^\alpha_i a & (i\lt j) \\
                     -_{j}\partial^\alpha_i a & (i \gt j)
\end{cases}
$$

$$      \varepsilon_i(a+_j b) = \begin{cases}
      \varepsilon_i a +_{j+1} \varepsilon_i b & (i \leq j) \\
      \varepsilon_i a +_j\varepsilon_i b & (i \gt j) \end{cases}$$ 

$$      \varepsilon_i (-_j b) =
                  \begin{cases}
     -_{j+1} \varepsilon_i a & (i \leq j) \\
     -_j \varepsilon_i a & (i \gt j) \end{cases}$$

We have for $i \ne j$ and whenever both sides are defined:

$$
   (a+_i b) +_j (c+_i d) = (a+_j c) +_i (b+_j d)
$$

These relations are called the _interchange laws_, and both sides of this equation may be written:

$$\begin{bmatrix} a& c\\ b & d  \end{bmatrix} \quad _{i}\!\downarrow ^{\textstyle\to ^j}$$

 Further:

$
-_i (a+_j b) = (-_i a) +_j (-_i b)$    and  $ -_i (-_j a) =
-_j (-_i a)$  if $i \ne j$  

$-_j(a+_j b)  = (-_j  b)+_j(-_j a)$  and  $ -_j (-_j a) =a$.
   



If further $K$ is a cubical set with [[connection on a cubical set|connections]] then we also require  
     

$$    \Gamma^\alpha _i (a+_j b) = \begin{cases}
      \Gamma_i^\alpha a +_{j+1} \Gamma_i^\alpha b & (i \lt j) \\
      \Gamma_i^\alpha  a +_j\Gamma_i\alpha  b & (i \lt j) \end{cases}$$

$$    \Gamma_j^+(a+_j b)= (\Gamma_j^+ a +_{j} \varepsilon_j a) +_{j+1}
    (\varepsilon_{j+1} a +_{j} \Gamma_j^+ b)$$ 


$$    \Gamma_j^-(a+_j b)= (\Gamma_j^- a +_{j} \varepsilon_{j+1}  b) +_{j+1}
    (\varepsilon_{j} b +_{j} \Gamma_j^- b)$$

These last two equations are  called the _transport laws_ and the right hand sides are also written respectively 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} \Gamma^+_j a & \varepsilon_j a \\
\varepsilon_{j+1} a & \Gamma^+_j b  \end{bmatrix} \quad _{j+1}\!\downarrow ^{\textstyle\to ^j} $$


$$ \begin{bmatrix} \Gamma^-_j a & \varepsilon_{j+1} b \\
\varepsilon_{j} b & \Gamma^-_j b  \end{bmatrix} \quad _{j+1}\!\downarrow ^{\textstyle\to ^j} $$


They can be interpreted as saying that turning left, or right, with your arm outstretched, is the same as turning left, or right. 



 It is easily verified that the singular cubical set $KX$ of a
space $X$  satisfies these axioms if $+_j , -_j$  are defined by

$$
   (a+_j b)(t_1 ,t_2 ,\ldots \, ,t_n ) = \begin{cases}
   a(t_1 ,\ldots \, , t_{j-1},2t_j,t_{j+1} ,\ldots, ,t_n) &(t_j \leq
   \frac{1}{2})\\
   b(t_1 ,\ldots \, , t_{j-1},2t_j-1,t_{j+1} ,\ldots \, ,t_n) &(t_j \geq
   \frac{1}{2})\\
   \end{cases}
 $$

whenever  $ \partial^+_j a=\partial^-_j b$; and

$$
(-_j a)(t_1 ,t_2 ,\ldots,t_n ) = a(t_1 ,\ldots,
t_{j-1},1-t_j,t_{j+1} ,\ldots,t_n).
$$


The above list of relations may seem formidable, but they all express simple geometric ideas most of which have been well used in some form or another  in algebraic topology. 

Notice also that in the singular cubical complex of a space, the interchange and transport laws hold **exactly**.  




We also get a (strict) notion of [[cubical omega-category]] with connections by assuming that  all compositions $+_i$ give a category structure with source and target maps $\partial^-_i, \partial^+_i:K_n \to K_{n-1}$ and identity maps $\varepsilon_i: K_{n-1} \to K_n$, and also for all $a$ 

$$\Gamma^+_i a \circ_i\Gamma^-_i a = \varepsilon _{i+1} a, \quad
\Gamma^+_i a \circ_{i+1}\Gamma^-_i a = \varepsilon_{i}a.  $$


These are important **cancellation** laws for the connections. They can be interpreted as saying that turning left and then right, or vice versa, leaves you facing the same way.  They were introduced by C.B. Spencer for double categories (see below). 

In the [[omega-groupoid]] case, the $\Gamma^+_i$ can be recovered from the $\Gamma^-_i$, and vice versa,  by using the inverses, assumed to arise from the groupoid structure. 

The main result of the first paper below is that (strict) cubical omega-groupoids with connections are equivalent to crossed complexes. It is easy to construct a functor from the former to the latter; the hard work is to show that such an omega-groupoid may be functorially reconstructed from the crossed complex it contains. 

The main result of the second  paper below is that (strict) cubical omega-categories  with connections are equivalent to strict globular omega-categories.
