## Idea 

The **little $k$-disk operad** or **little $k$-cubes operad** (to distinguish from the [[framed little n-disk operad]]) is the [[topological operad]]/[[(∞,1)-operad]] $E_k$ whose $n$-ary operations are parameterized by rectilinear disjoint embeddings of $n$ $k$-dimensional cubes into another $k$-dimensional cube.

When regarded as a [[topological operad]], the topology on the space of all such embedding is such that a continuous path is given by continuously moving the images of these little cubes in the big cube around.

Therefore the [[algebra over an operad|algebras over]] the $E_k$ operad are "$k$-fold monoidal" objects For instance [[k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-category|k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-categories]].

The limiting [[E-∞ operad]] is a [[resolution]] of the ordinary commutative monoid operad [[Comm]]. Its algebras are [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy commutative monoid objects]] such as $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-ring|rings]].



## Definition

(...)

An [[algebra over an operad]] over $E_k$ is an [[Ek-algebra]].

### Presentation by enriched operads

(...)

**Remark**

Many models for $E_\infty$-operads in the literature are not in fact cofibrant in the [[model structure on operads]], but are $\Sigma$-cofibrant. By the therem at [[model structure on algebras over an operad]], this is sufficient for their categories of algebras to present the correct $\infty$-categories of [[E-∞ algebras]].

## Properties {#Propeties}


### Grouplike monoid objects {#GrouplikeMonoid}

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] and $X : Assoc \to \mathcal{X}$ be a monoid object in $\mathcal{X}$.  Say that $X$ is _grouplike_ if the composite

$$
  \Delta^{op} \to Ass \to \mathcal{X}
$$

(see 1.1.13 of [[Commutative Algebra]])

is a [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|groupoid object]] in $\mathcal{X}$.

Say an $\mathbb{E}[1]$-algebra object is grouplike if it is grouplike as an $Ass$-monoid. Say that an $\mathbb{E}[k]$-algebra object in $\mathcal{X}$ is grouplike if the restriction along $\mathbb{E}[1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{E}[k]$ is.
Write 

$$
  Mon^{gp}_{\mathbb{E}[k]}(\mathcal{X})
  \subset
  Mon_{\mathbb{E}[k]}(\mathcal{X})
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of grouplike $\mathbb{E}[k]$-monoid objects.


### $k$-fold delooping, monoidalness and $\mathbb{E}[k]$-action###
{: #MainResult}

The following result of ([Lurie](#Lurie)) makes precise for _parameterized [[∞-groupoid]]s_  -- for [[∞-stack]]s -- the general statement that $k$-fold [[delooping]] provides a correspondence betwen [[n-category|n-categories]] that have trivial [[k-morphism|r-morphism]]s for $r \lt k$ and  [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (k-tuply monoidal $\infty$-stacks)

Let $k \gt 0$, let $\mathcal{X}$ be an [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] and let $\mathcal{X}_*^{\geq k}$ denote the [[full subcategory]] of the category $\mathcal{X}_{*}$ of pointed objects, spanned by those pointed objects thar are $k-1$-[[connected]] (i.e. their first $k$ [[homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|∞-stack homotopy groups]]) vanish. Then there is a canonical equivalence of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  \mathcal{X}_*^{\geq k} \simeq Mon^{gp}_{\mathbb{E}[k]}(\mathcal{X}) \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is [[Ek-Algebras|EKAlg, theorem 1.3.6.]].

Specifically for $\mathcal{X} = Top$, this refines to the classical theorem by ([May](#May)).

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (May recognition theorem)

Let $Y$ be a [[topological space]] equipped with an action of the [[little cubes operad]] $\mathcal{C}_k$ and suppose that $X$ is grouplike. Then $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to a $k$-fold loop space $\Omega^k X$ for some pointed topological space $X$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is [[Ek-Algebras|EkAlg, theorem 1.3.16.]]

### Stabilization hypothesis {#StabilizationHypothesis}

A proof of the [[stabilization hypothesis]] for [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]] is a byproduct of corollary 1.1.10 of ([Lurie](#Lurie)), stated as example 1.2.3.


### Additivity theorem {#AdditivityTheorem}

It has been long conjectured that it should be true that when suitably defined, there is a tensor product of $\infty$-operads such that 

$$
  \mathbb{E}_k \otimes \mathbb{E}_{k'} \simeq \mathbb{E}_{k + k'}
  \,.
$$

This is discussed and realized in section 1.2. of ([Lurie](#Lurie)). The tensor product is defined in appendix B.7.


### Homology: Poisson operads

For an $E_k$-operad in a [[category of chain complexes]], its [[homology]] is the [[Poisson operad]] $P_{k}$.

See for instance [Costello](#Costello)
