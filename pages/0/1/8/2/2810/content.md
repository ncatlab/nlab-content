## Idea ##

The **$E_k$-operad** or **little $k$-cubes operad** is the [[operad]] or [[(∞,1)-operad]] whose $n$-ary operations are parameterized by rectilinear disjoint embeddings of $n$ $k$-dimensional cubes into another $k$-dimensional cube.

When regarded as a [[topological operad]], the topology on the space of all such embedding is such that a continuous path is given by continuously moving the images of these little cubes in the big cube around.

Therefore the [[algebra over an operad|algebras over]] the $E_k$ operad are "$k$-fold monoidal" objects For instance [[k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-category|k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-categories]].

The limiting $E_\infty$ operad is the resolution of the ordinary commutative monoid operad $Comm$. Its algebras are [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy commutative monoid objects]] such as [[E-∞-ring]]s.

Do you really think that '[[E-∞ ring]]s' looks better than $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-ring|rings]]'?  If so, OK, but I\'m surprised!
