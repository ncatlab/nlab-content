
The Eilenberg swindle gives a means to prove that the [[Grothendieck group]] of many abelian categories is zero; it is the reason that, for instance, one has to restrict oneself to finitely generated projective modules in defining $K_0$ of a ring.

The idea is essentially the Hilbert hotel paradox.
Given an abelian category $A$ with countable [[direct sums]], one can show that $K(A)=0$.  If $X \in A$, then $X \oplus \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\infty} X \simeq \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\infty} X $, which implies $[X]=0$ in $K(A)$.
