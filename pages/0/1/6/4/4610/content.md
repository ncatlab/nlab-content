A _sifted colimit_ is a [[colimit]] of a [[diagram]] $D \to C$ where $D$ is a [[sifted category]] (in analogy with a [[filtered colimit]], involving diagrams of shape a [[filtered category]]). Such limits commute with finite [[products]] in $Set$ by definition.

A motivating example is a [[reflexive coequalizer]]. In fact, sifted colimits can "almost" be characterized as combinations of [[filtered colimits]] and reflexive coequalizers.
