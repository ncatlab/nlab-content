A sifted colimit is a [[colimit]] of a [[category]] $D$ where the [[diagonal functor]] $\Delta\colon D \rightarrow D \times D$ is [[final functor|final]]. Such limits commute with finite [[products]] in $Set$.

Does this mean a colimit of a diagram $J\colon D \to C$ where $D$ has this property?

A motivating example is a [[reflexive coequalizer]]. In fact, sifted colimits can "almost" be characterized as combinations of [[filtered colimits]] and reflexive coequalizers.
