## Idea

A **weak colimit** for a [[diagram]] in a [[category]] is a [[cocone]] over that diagram which satisfies the existence property of a [[colimit]] but not necessarily the uniqueness. The dual concept is a [[weak limit]], see there for more.

For example, a **weakly initial object** in a category, $C$, is such that there is at least one arrow from it to any object in $C$.
