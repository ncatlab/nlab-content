Informally, a **free functor** is a left adjoint to a [[forgetful functor]].

One formal sort of free functor is the left adjoint $C\to C^T$, where $T$ is a [[monad]] on the category $C$ and $C^T$ is its [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] (the category of $T$-algebras).  This includes:

* The "free group" functor $Set \to Grp$

* The "free abelian group" functor $Set \to Ab$

* The "free category" functor $DiGraph \to Cat$

and many others.
