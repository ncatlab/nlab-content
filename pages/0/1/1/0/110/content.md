A morphism is what goes between [[object]]s in a [[category]].  

Given two objects in a category, say $x$ and $y$, there is a set $hom(x,y)$, called a [[homset]], whose elements are morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  Given a morphism $f$ in this homset, we write $f:x \to y$ to indicate that it goes from $x$ to $y$.

The most familiar example is the category [[Set]], where the objects are sets and the morphisms are functions.  Here if $x$ and $y$ are sets, a morphism $f: x \to y$ is a function from $x$ to $y$.
