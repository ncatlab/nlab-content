## Idea

The notion of _morphism_ in [[category theory]] is an abstraction of the notion of [[homomorphism]]. 

In a general [[category]], a morphism is an arrow between two [[objects]]. 

## Definition

Given two objects in a (locally small) category, say $x$ and $y$, there is a set $hom(x,y)$, called a [[hom-set]], whose elements are morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  Given a morphism $f$ in this hom-set, we write $f:x \to y$ to indicate that it goes from $x$ to $y$.

More generally, a morphism is what goes between objects in any [[n-category]].


## Examples

The most familiar example is the category [[Set]], where the objects are sets and the morphisms are functions.  Here if $x$ and $y$ are sets, a morphism $f: x \to y$ is a function from $x$ to $y$.
