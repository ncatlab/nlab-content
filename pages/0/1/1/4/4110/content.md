## Introduction

__Stigler's law of eponymy__ is the principle that fundamental discoveries are named after the person who made them famous, not the person who made them first, and these are often not the same person.

It is also called the __Matthew effect__, after Matthew 25:29. It is a variant of Arnold's law, which also applies to itself.

In certain parts of the mathematics community this is also called **Baez\'s law**, which states that

> "Any effect, constant, theorem or equation named after Professor X was first discovered by Professor Y, for some value of Y not equal to X."

## Examples

### In mathematics

* [[currying|Currying]] was first identified by [[Moses Schonfinkel|Moses Schönfinkel]], rather than by [[Haskell Curry]].
* [[Kripke frame]]s go back before Kripke to 1957; see [nForum discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1991).
* [[Conduché functors]] were introduced by [[Jean Giraud]] 8 years before [[F. Conduché]].
* [[Russell's paradox]] was first proved by [[Ernst Zermelo]] rather than [[Bertrand Russell]]

There are several more already on the nLab; they just don't link here yet.

### In physics

* [[Hubble's law]] was first formulated by [[Georges Lemaître]] rather than [[Edwin Hubble]]
