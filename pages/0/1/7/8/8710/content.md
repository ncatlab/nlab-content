## Idea

**Differential cohesive homotopy type theory** or **elastic homotopy type theory** is the (hypothetical) [[modal type theory]] obtained by adding to [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] an [[adjoint triple]] of [[idempotent monad|idempotent (co)monadic]] [[modalities]]:

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
$$

called

* [[reduction modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]].

{#AlsoCalledElastic} (Also called *elastic* homotopy theory $[$[[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|SS20, §3.1.2]]$]$, see at *[[geometry of physics -- categories and toposes]]* the sections on *[elastic toposes](geometry+of+physics+--+categories+and+toposes#ElasticToposes)* and *[elastic $\infty$-toposes](geometry+of+physics+--+categories+and+toposes#ElasticInfinityToposes)*.)

By the discussion at _[[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion]]_ this language can express at least the following notions

* [[reduced type]], [[infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid]], [[de Rham space]], [[jet bundle]], [[D-geometry]], [[∞-Lie algebra]] (synthetically), [[Lie differentiation]], hence "Formal [[Moduli Problems and DG-Lie Algebras]]" , [[formally etale morphism]], [[formally smooth morphism]], [[formally unramified morphism]], [[smooth etale ∞-groupoid]], hence [[∞-orbifold]] etc. 

No full formalization of such a type theory currently exists, and how to design such a theory is an open question in [[modal type theory]].

## Partial Realizations

Some work has been done on [[synthetic differential geometry]] in modal homotopy type theory.

[[Felix Cherubini]] ([Cherubini18](#Cherubini)) has formalized some synthetic differential geometry using an abstract [[infinitesimal shape modality]] working in plain homotopy type theory.

[[David Jaz Myers]] ([JazMyers22](#JazMyers)) formalized a synthetic theory of [[orbifolds]] working in a type theory extending [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] with axioms such as the [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] to axiomatize the notion of infinitesimals and defines the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] and [[shape modality]] as [[localizations]] at the infinitesimals and reals respectively.
