## Idea

A unit is a [[quantity]] $u$ such that every other quantity (of a certain type) is a multiple of $u$.


## Definitions

Exactly what this means depends on context.


### Units in rings

In a [[commutative ring]] (or [[rig]]) $R$, a __unit__ is an [[element]] of $R$ that has an [[inverse element|inverse]].  In a noncommutative [[ring]], we distinguish _left_ and _right_ units.

If $u$ is a left unit in a ring, then any other element $x$ is a left multiple of $u$:
$$ x = (x u^{-1}) u .$$
Similarly, if $u$ is a right unit, then $x$ is a right multiple of $u$:
$$ x = u (u^{-1} x) .$$


### Units of measurement

In [[physics]], the quantities of a given dimension generally form an $\mathbb{R}$-[[line]], a $1$-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]].  Then any non-[[zero]] quantity is a unit, called in this context a __unit of measurement__.  Often (but not always) these quantities form an [[orientation|oriented]] line, so that nonzero quantities are either positive or negative.  Then we usually also require a unit of measurement to be positive.

For example, the [[kilogramme]] is a unit of mass, because any mass may be expressed as a real multiple of the kilogramme.  Further, it is a positive unit; the mass of any physical object is a positive quantity and may be expressed as a positive real multiple of the kilogramme.
