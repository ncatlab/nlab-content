## Idea

### In solid state physics

In [[physics]], specifically in _[[solid state physics]]_, _elasticity_ is the tendency of solid materials to return to their original shape after being deformed. The mechanics of elastic bodies is the topic of _[infinitesimal strain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_strain_theory)_.

### Analogy with a quality of space

Elasticity is commonly used as an illustration via [[analogy]] of the nature of [[space]] in [[physics]], specifically that of [[manifolds]] and [[spacetimes]].

#### In natural philosophy

In [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]_ (1817) there is discussion (in the section _[Physik -- Die Koh&#228;sion](Science%20of%20Logic#Kohaesion)_) of the _[[cohesion]]_ and _elasticity_ of some [[substance]] which Hegel says is is the [[unity of opposites|unity]] of [[space]] and [[time]] ([PN&#167;261](Science%20of%20Logic#PN261)). 

#### In categorical logic / topos theory
 {#InCategoricalLogic}

[[William Lawvere]] argued that the "[[objective logic]]" of this discussion is to be formalized via [[categorical logic]] by the axiomatics of [[cohesive toposes]] (see there for references), i.e. by [[modal type theory]] equipped with [[shape modality]] and [[flat modality]].

But Hegel goes on to speak of cohesion being refined to _elasticity_:

> [PN&#167;297Zusatz](Science+of+Logic#PN297Zusatz) Elasticity is the whole of cohesion.

According to [PN&#167;298](Science+of+Logic#PN298) this elasticity is related to the [[unity of opposites]] that consistute [[Zeno's paradox of motion]], hence to the modern concept of [[differentiation]] via a [[limit of a sequence]].  In terms of [[categorical logic]] this is precisely what is encoded in the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] and [[infinitesimal flat modality]] of "[[differential cohesion]]". 

Sticking to imagery from [[solid state physics]], these modalities are reminiscent of concepts in [infinitesimal strain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_strain_theory). Notice that this applies to 

> structures built from relatively stiff elastic materials 

(And so maybe it would be suggestive to rename "differential cohesion" to "elastic cohesion"?)


#### Rubber-sheet geometry

These modalities [above](#InCategoricalLogic) induce an axiomatization of _[manifolds and &#233;tale groupoids](differential+cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#EtaleObjects)_ ("[[derived schemes]]") for which a common imagery in mathematics is given by elastic rubber sheets, reflecting the fact that these spaces on top of their [[cohesion]] have a more rigid [[shape modality|shape]]], namely [[infinitesimal shape modality|infinitesimal shape]].

In this context the [[topology]] of [[manifolds]] is often referred to as _rubber-sheet geometry_ (e.g.[Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology), [Britton](#Britton))

#### Rubber-sheet analogy of gravity


Moreover, these modalities [above](#InCategoricalLogic) induce an axiomatizatioon of [[Cartan geometry]], hence in particular of [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]] and hence of [[gravity]] ("[[general relativity]]") on these manifolds.

A popular imagery for that illustrates the gravitational effect of massive bodies on light by a deformation of spacetime visualizes as an elastic wire frame. This is known as the _rubber-sheet analogy_ for gravity (e.g. [Das 11, p. 69](#Das), [Gabor](#Gabor), [Volk, fig. 4 on p. 537](#Volk)).

This seems to go back to the technical result of ([Sakharov 67](#Sakharov67)), which is informally summarized in the seminal textbook ([Misner-Thorne-Wheeler 73](#MisnerThorneWheeler73)) as saying that

> gravity is "an elasticity of space that arises from particle physics"

Further references discussing the analogy between the mathematical theory of elasticity and that of gravity are collected in ([Tartaglia 95](#Tartaglia95)).
