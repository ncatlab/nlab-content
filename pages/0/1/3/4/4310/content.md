A **biring** is a [[commutative ring]] $R$ equipped with ring [[homomorphisms]] called **coaddition**:

$$ R \to R \otimes R $$

**cozero**:

$$ R \to \mathbb{Z} $$

**co-additive inverse**:

$$ R \to R $$

**comultiplication**:

$$ R \to R \otimes R $$

and the **multiplicative counit**:

$$ R \to \mathbb{Z} $$

satisfying the usual axioms of a commutative ring, but 'turned around'.  More precisely, a biring is a [[internalization|commutative ring object]] in the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of commutative rings (also known as the category of [[affine schemes]]).  Equivalently, a biring is a commutative ring $R$ equipped with a lift of the functor 

$$ hom(-, R) : CommRing \to Set $$

to a functor

$$ hom(-, R) : CommRing \to CommRing $$

Birings form a [[monoidal category]] thanks to composition of functors, and a [[monoid object]] in this monoidal category is called a [[plethory]].  A plethory is an example of a [[Tall–Wraith monoid]].
