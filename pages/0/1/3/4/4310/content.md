A **biring** is a ring $R$ equipped with a lift of the functor 

$$ hom(-, R) : Ring \to Set $$

to a functor

$$ hom(-, R) : Ring \to Ring $$

In other words, it is a [[co-ring]] in the category of rings.

Birings form a monoidal category thanks to composition of functors, and a monoid in this monoidal category is called a [[plethory]].
