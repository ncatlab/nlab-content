## Idea

A _spherical category_ is a  [[monoidal category]] with [[dualizable object|dual]]s that behaves as if its morphisms can be drawn and moved around on a sphere.


## Definition

A **spherical category** is a [[pivotal category]] where the left and right [[trace]] operations coincide on all objects.
