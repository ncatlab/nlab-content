## Definition

A [[lattice]] is *semimodular* if it satisfies the *Jordan-HÃ¶lder condition* (all maximal [[chains]]  between two [[elements]] $x\lt y$ are of the same length), if it has a finite height and its height function $h$ satisfies the  semimodular inequality
$$
h(x) + h(y) \geq h(x\wedge y) + h(x\vee y) 
$$
