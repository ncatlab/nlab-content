A __left module $k$-algebra__ is a $k$-algebra $A$ equipped with a left [[Hopf action]] (also sometimes said module algebra action) $\triangleright: B\otimes A\to A$ of a $k$-bialgebra $B$. Sometimes one talks about module algebras meaning a monoid with Hopf actions of a bimonoid in a more general symmetric monoidal category; a <em>module monoid</em> would be a better term if the category is not $k$-linear.
