An **∞-group** is a [[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category|group object]] in [[∞Grpd]].  Equivalently (by the [[delooping hypothesis]]) it is a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[connected groupoid|connected]] $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]].

Under the [[homotopy hypothesis|identification]] of [[∞Grpd]] with [[Top]] this is known as an $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-space|space]], for instance.

Special cases are

* [[group]]

* [[2-group]]

* $n$-[[n-group|group]]
