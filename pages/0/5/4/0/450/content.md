A _1-fold category_ is a [[category]]. An _$n$-fold category_ for $n \gt 1$ is a [[internal category|internal to]] $(n-1)$-fold categories.  (A $0$-fold category is a [[set]].)

2-fold categories were introduced as [[double category|double categories]] by Ehresmann (1963).

Analogously $1$-fold groupoids are groupoids and $n$-fold groupoids are groupoids [[internal category|internal to]] $(n-1)$-fold categories.

#Remarks#

* Notice that an $n$-fold category is a _strict_ version of an [[n-category]] in that all $n$ composition operations are strictly unital and associative and strictly commute with each other. Still, $n$-fold groupoids model all [[homotopy n-type]]s. See [[homotopy hypothesis]].

* Analogous to how a [[group]] is a groupoid with a single object, one can consider $(n+1)$-fold groupoids for which all morphisms in one of the $(n+1)$ directions are endomorphisms. These are the [[cat-n-group]]s.

* By a theorem by Brown and Higgins, [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] are equivalent to those $\infty$-fold categories that satisfy a couple of restrictive properties (something like that all 1-categories of $n$-cells for all $n$ are the same and that all the "thin" identity elements exist, called "connections").
