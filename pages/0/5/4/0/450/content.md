A _1-fold category_ is a [[category]]. An _$n$-fold category_ for $n \gt 1$ is a [[internal category|internal to]] $(n-1)$-fold categories.  (A $0$-fold category is a [[set]].)

2-fold categories were introduced as [[double category|double categories]] by Ehresmann (1963).

#Remarks#

By a theorem by Brown and Higgins, [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] are equivalent to $\infty$-fold categories satisfying a couple of restrictive properties (something like that all 1-categories of $n$-cells for all $n$ are the same and that all the "thin" identity elements exist, called "connections").
