## Idea

The concept of _length_ of an [[object]] in a suitable [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is akin to the concept of [[dimension]] of [[vector spaces]], to which it reduces in the case that $\mathcal{C} = $ [[Vect]]. The 1-dimensional vector space is a [[simple object]], and the [[dimension]] of a vector space $V$, if it is finite, may be thought of as the number of times that one may split off such a simple object from $V$. The definition of _length_ generalizes this concept, notably to [[modules]] over some [[ring]].

## Definition

Given an [[object]] $X$ in a suitable [[tensor category]], then a _Jordan-H&#246;lder sequence_ or _composition series_ for $X$ is a [[filtration]]

$$
  0 = X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n = X
$$

such that for all $i$ then the [[quotient]] $X_i/X_{i-1}$ exists and is a [[simple object]].

If this exists, then under suitable conditions $n$ is uniquely specified and is then called the _length_ of $X$.
