# Ordered pairs

* tic
{: toc}


## Idea

Given any things $a$ and $b$, the __ordered pair__ of $a$ and $b$ is a thing, usually written $(a,b)$, sometimes $[a,b]$ or $\langle{a,b}\rangle$.  The important property is that $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$.


## Formalisations

See [[cartesian product]] for now.
