The usual definition of [[sheaf]] requires the underlying [[site]] to be a small category. However, for many purposes it is desireable to consider the notion of sheaves on large sites such as [[Top]] or [[Diff]].

One way to deal with this is to consider  [[subcategory|full subcategories]] of these large categories on objects whose size is bounded by some large cardinal. The idea is that for sheaves and in particular for any [[homotopy theory]] of sheaves the choice of these cardinality bounds is inessential. 

See for instance [p. 2](http://www.math.uwo.ca/~jardine/papers/Fields-01.pdf#page=2) of Jardine, [Fields Lectuere: Simplicial presheaves](http://www.math.uwo.ca/~jardine/papers/Fields-01.pdf) where this issue arises in the study of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] and the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

Can any of you size-issue experts help to clarify this?
