## Idea

_Prime ideals_ are supposed to be a generalization of [[prime numbers]] from elements of the [[ring]] of [[integers]] to [[ideals]] in the sense of 'ideal elements' of an arbitrary [[ring]] (usually [[commutative ring|commutative]], but also possible something more general than a ring).  It\'s not clear that they do so; [[maximal ideals]] and [[irreducible ideals]] may do a better job.  (In particular, [[zero]] is *not* a prime number, and the [[zero ideal]] of $\mathbb{Z}$ is neither maximal nor irreducible; however, it *is* prime.)  Nevertheless, they have assumed an importance that dwarfs any question of original motivation.

## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn #rig}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[rig]] (assumed unital and associative as usual), and let $P$ be a [[two-sided ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x a y$ does for all $a$:
$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; (\forall\, a \in R,\; x a y \in P) \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
Also, $P$ is __completely prime__ if $P$ is proper and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x y$ does:
$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$

Note that every completely prime ideal is prime (using that $R$ is unital).  The converse holds if the rig is commutative (using that $P$ is an ideal).  So in [[commutative algebra]] one usually uses the (simpler) definition of completely prime ideal as the definition of prime ideal.

###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring|commutative]] rig, and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x y$ does:
$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$

Essentially the same definition applies in [[order theory]], using the analogy (which is more than an analogy in the case of a [[distributive lattice]]) between multiplication in a rig and the [[meet]] in an order:

+-- {: .num_defn #lattice}
Let $R$ be a [[lattice]], and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever their meet does:
$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x \wedge y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
=--

There is an infinitary version of this that is called 'complete' but is *not* equivalent to the notion in Definition \ref{rig} of a completely prime ideal from the noncommutative theory:
+-- {: .num_defn #complattice}
Let $R$ be a [[complete lattice]], and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __completely prime__ if some element belongs to $P$ whenever the meet of a subset of $R$ does:
$$ \forall\, X \subseteq R,\; \bigwedge X \in P \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\wedge\; x \in P .$$
=--
With a little sublety, this makes sense even when [[meets]] (and [[joins]]) don't always exist:

+-- {: .num_defn #preorder}
Let $R$ be a [[preorder]], and let $P$ be an ideal in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever every $z$ that precedes both $x$ and $y$ does:
$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; z \leq x \;\Rightarrow\; z \in I) \;\Rightarrow\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; z \leq y \;\Rightarrow\; z \in I) \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
Also, $P$ is __completely prime__ if $P$ if some element belongs to $P$ whenever every $z$ that precedes every element of a subset of $R$ does:
$$ \forall\, X \subseteq R,\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; (\forall\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\Rightarrow\; z \leq x) \;\Rightarrow\; z \in I) \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\wedge\; x \in P .$$

As discussed at [[ideals in a monoid]], there is for two-sided ideals an operation of ideal multiplication, making the ideal lattice a [[quantale]] (cf. [[Day convolution]]). Namely, if $I, J$ are ideals, then their product $I J$ is the ideal generated by all products $x y$ with $x \in I, y \in J$ in the case of rigs. Similarly, in the case of lattices, we could define $I J$ to be the ideal generated by all meets $x \wedge y$ -- but in this case the result is the same as $I \cap J$. In any case, we say that a proper ideal $P$ is __[[prime ideal|prime]]__ if for any ideals $I, J$, the condition $I J \subseteq P$ implies $I \subseteq P$ or $J \subseteq P$. (An [[unbiased]] definition that automatically includes the requirement that $P$ be proper is that whenever $P$ contains the product of a [[finite list]] of ideals, then $P$ contains at least one of the ideals in the list.) In [[order theory]], the term 'prime ideal' is usually used for an _irreducible ideal_ (see below), since the two are equivalent for lattices (where both concepts apply).

In the commutative case, we can characterize an ideal $I$ as prime if it is proper and it satisfies a binary condition corresponding to the nullary condition that is properness:

*  In a rig, $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if $x y \in I$;
*  In a proset, $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if, for all $z$, $z \in I$ if $z \leq x$ or $z \leq y$.
*  In a lattice (simplifying the proset version to look like the rig version), $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if $x \wedge y \in I$.

For noncommutative rigs, however, a two-sided ideal $P$ is prime if it satisfies a weaker binary condition: $(\forall_{x: R} a x b \in P) \Rightarrow a \in P \vee b \in P$. For example, in a [[matrix ring]] $M_n(k)$ over a field $k$, the zero ideal is prime under our definition (really because a matrix ring is a [[simple ring]], where the zero ideal is a maximal ideal), but $a b = 0$ does not imply $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. When the stronger binary condition is satisfied, we say $P$ is __completely prime__.  (But in order theory, this means a completely irreducible ideal; see below.)
