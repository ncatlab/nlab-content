## Idea

For any notion of [[bundles]] with [[fibers]] from a [[pointed category]], a *zero bundle* is a [[bundle]] all whose fibers are [[zero objects]].

The construction of zero-bundles typically (such as in the following examples) constitutes a [[bireflective subcategory]] inclusion

$$
  Spaces \hookrightarrow Bundles
$$

of the category of base spaces into the given category of bundles.


For example:

* in the context of [[vector bundles]] the zero-bundle over a base space $B$ is the bundle $B \times \{0\} \xrightarrow{pr_1} X$ all whose [[fibers]] are the [[zero]]-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]], and the induced [[bireflective subcategory]] inclusion is that of base spaces into the corresponding category [[VectBund]];

* in the context of [[retractive spaces]] the zero-bundle over a base space $B$ is the [[identity]] map on $B$, all whose fibers are (equal or, in [[homotopy theory]], [[weak homotopy equivalence|equivalent]] to) the [[point]] $\ast$ regarded as a [[pointed space]];

* in the context of [[parameterized spectra]], the zero-bundle over a base space $X$ has all fibers the [[zero]]-[[spectrum]] $0_\bullet$ (i.e. the spectrum all whose components are [[contractible homotopy type|contractible]], $0_n \simeq \ast$ for all $n$).

(Beware that a zero-bundle is generally -- such as in the above examples -- *not* an [[empty bundle]].)
