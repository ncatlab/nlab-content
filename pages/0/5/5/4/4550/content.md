__[Benoit Fresse](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/)__ is a mathematician at Lille. One of his interests concerns the theory of [[operads]].

His papers include:

* _Lie theory of formal groups over an operad_, J. Alg. __202__, 455--511, 1998, [doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jabr.1997.7280) 

* _Modules over operads and functors_, Springer LNM __1967__, 2009, x+308 pp. [MR2010e:18009](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2494775)

As of early 2016, Fresse has recently completed a large two-volume book project:

*  _Homotopy of Operads and Grothendieck-Teichm&#252;ller Groups (Volumes 1 & 2)_, [website](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/OperadHomotopyBook/) 

Fresse lists two main aims of the book project: 1. the development of a [[rational homotopy theory]] for operads, and 2. to explain the relationship between operads and [[Grothendieck-Teichm√ºller groups]].
