## Idea

A _tempered (or Schwartz) distribution_ is a [[distribution]] $u\in\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ that does not "grow too fast" -- at most polynomial (or moderate/tempered) growth -- at infinity (in all directions); in particular it is only defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, not on any open subset. Formally, a tempered distribution is a [[continuous linear functional]] on the [[Schwartz space]] $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of [[smooth functions with rapidly decreasing derivatives]]. The space of tempered distributions (with its natural topology) is denoted $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The main property is that its Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}u$ is well-defined, and is itself a tempered distribution; and that it naturally extends the standard Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}: L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \to L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. This makes tempered distributions the natural setting for solving (linear) partial differential equations.

###### Definition
**(tempered distributions)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a _[[tempered distribution]]_ on the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[continuous linear functional]] on the [[Schwartz space]] $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ([this def.](Schwartz+space#SchwartzSpaceOfFunctionsWithRapidlyDecreasingDerivatives)) of [[smooth functions with rapidly decreasing derivatives]].

The [[topological vector space]] of tempered distributions is denoted $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
