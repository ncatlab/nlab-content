If $C$ and $D$ are [[sites]], a [[functor]] $F\colon C\to D$ is **cover-preserving** (some people say **continuous**) if whenever $R$ is a [[covering family]] of an object $U\in C$, its image $F(R)$ is a covering family of $F(U)$ in $D$.

If $F$ is also [[flat functor|flat]], then it is called a [[morphism of sites]], and induces a [[geometric morphism]] between [[sheaf toposes]].
