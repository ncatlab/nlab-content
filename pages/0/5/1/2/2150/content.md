Let $X$ be a [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[Hausdorff space]]. A [[sheaf]] $F$ of [[groups]] over $X$ is __fine__ if for every two disjoint closed subsets $A,B\subset X$, $A\cap B\neq \emptyset$, there is an [[endomorphism]] of the sheaf of groups $F\to F$ which restricts to the identity in a neighborhood of $A$ and to the $0$ endomorphism in a neighborhood of $B$. Every fine sheaf is [[soft sheaf|soft]].
