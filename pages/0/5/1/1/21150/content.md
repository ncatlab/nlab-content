> One can make $[$[[chiral perturbation theory]]$]$ consistent with [[QCD]] by suitably matching the [[correlators]] of the [[effective field theory|effective theory]] to those of [[QCD]] at a [[scale]] near $\Lambda$. Clearly this procedure is not limited to only one set of [[vector mesons]]; in fact, one can readily generalize it to an infinite number of hidden [[gauge fields]] in an [[effective field theory|effective]] [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]]. In so doing, it turns out that a fifth dimension is "deconstructed" in a (4+1)-dimensional (or 5D) [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] type form. We will see in Part III that such a structure arises, [[top-down model building|top-down]], in [[string theory]].

> $[$this [[holographic QCD]]$]$ model comes out to describe — unexpectedly well — low-energy properties of both [[mesons]] and [[baryons]], in particular those properties reliably described in quenched [[lattice QCD]] simulations.

> $[...]$

> One of the most noticeable results of this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]] is the first derivation of [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] (VD) that holds both for [[mesons]] and for [[baryons]]. It has been somewhat of an oddity and a puzzle that [[Jun John Sakurai|Sakurai's]] [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] — with the lowest [[vector mesons]] [[rho meson|ρ]] and ω — which held very well for [[pion|pionic]] [[form factors]] at low momentum transfers famously failed for [[nucleon]] [[form factors]]. In this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]], the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] comes out automatically for both the [[pion]] and the [[nucleon]] provided that the infinite $[$[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-]]$]$tower is included. While the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] for the [[pion]] with the infinite tower is not surprising given the successful Sakurai VD, that the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] holds also for the [[nucleons]] is highly nontrivial. $[...]$ It turns out to be a consequence of a [[AdS/QCD|holographic]] [[Cheshire cat principle|Cheshire Cat phenomenon]]

> It is astounding that [[Tony Skyrme|Skyrme]] had suggested [[Skyrmion|his model]] as early as in 1961 before it has been generally accepted that [[pions]] are (pseudo) [[Goldstone bosons]] associated with the [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneous breaking]] of [[chiral symmetry]], and of course long before [[QCD|Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)]] has been put forward as the microscopic theory of [[strong nuclear force|strong interactions]].

> The revival of the Skyrme idea in 1983 is [due to Witten](Skyrmion#Witten83) who explained the _raison d'ˆetre_ of the [[Skyrmion|Skyrme model]] from the viewpoint of [[QCD]]. In the [[chiral perturbation theory|chiral limit]] when the light [[quark]] masses $m_u$, $m_d$, $m_s$ tend to zero, such that the octet of the pseudoscalar mesons [[pion|π]], [[kaon|K]] , η become nearly massless (pseudo) [[Goldstone bosons]], they are the lightest degrees of freedom of [[QCD]]. The [[effective field theory|effective]] chiral Lagrangian (EχL) for pseudoscalar mesons, understood as an infinite expansion in the derivatives of the pseudoscalar (or chiral) fields, encodes, in principle, full information about QCD. The famous two-term Skyrme Lagrangian can be understood as a low-energy truncation of this infinite series. Witten has added an important four-derivative [[WZW-term|Wess–Zumino term]] to the original Skyrme Lagrangian and pointed out that the overall coefficient in front of the EχL is proportional to the number of quark [[color charge|colours]] $N_c$.

> $[...]$

> Soon after Witten's work it has been realized that it is possible to bring the Skyrme model and the Skyrmion even closer to QCD and to the more customary language of constituent quarks. It has been first noticed $[$[6](#DiakonovEides83), [7a](#DharWadia84), [7b](#DarShankarWadia85), [8](#DiakonovPetrov86)$]$ that a simple chiral invariant Lagrangian for massive (constituent) quarks $Q$ interacting with the octet chiral field $\pi_A$ $(A = 1, ..., 8)$,

> $$\mathcal{L} = \overline{Q} \left( \partial\!\!\!\!/ - M e^{ \tfrac{i \pi^A \lambda^A \gamma_5}{F_\pi}  }  \right) Q$$

> induces, via a quark loop in the external pseudoscalar fields (see Fig. 3.1), the EχL whose lowest-derivative terms coincide with the Skyrme Lagrangian, including
automatically the Wess–Zumino term, with the correct coefficient!

> The condition that the winding number of the trial field is unity needs to be imposed to get a deeply bound state, that is to guarantee that the baryon number is unity. $[$[9](#DiakonovPetrovPobylitsa88)$]$ The Skyrmion is, thus, nothing but the **mean chiral field binding quarks in a baryon**.

> [[QCD]] is a challenging theory. Its most interesting aspects, namely the [[confinement]] of [[color charge|color]] and the [[chiral symmetry breaking]], have defied all analytical approaches. While there are now many data accumulated from the [[lattice gauge theory]], the methodology falls well short of giving us insights on how one may understand these phenomena analytically, nor does it give us a systematic way of obtaining a low energy theory of [[QCD]] below the [[confinement]] [[scale]]. 

> $[...]$

> it has been proposed early on that [[baryons]] are topological [[solitons]], namely [[Skyrmions]]  $[$but$]$ the usual [[Skyrmion]] picture of the [[baryon]] has to be modified significantly in the context of full [[QCD]]. $[...]$ the holographic picture naturally brings a gauge principle in the bulk description of the [[flavor physics|flavor]] dynamics in such a way that all spin one [[mesons]] as well as [[pions]] would enter the $[$ [[Skyrmion|skyrmionic]]-$]$construction of [[baryons]] on the equal footing.

> $[...]$

> [[holographic QCD]] is similar to the [[chiral perturbation theory]] in the sense that we deal with exclusively [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] [[observables|operators]] of the theory. The huge difference is, however, that this new approach tends to treat all [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] objects together. Not only the light [[meson]] [[field (physics)|fields]] like [[pions]] but also heavy [[vector mesons]] and [[baryons]] appear together, at least in principle. In other words, a [[holographic QCD]] deals with all [[color charge|color]]-[[trivial representation|singlets]] simultaneously, giving us a lot more predictive power.

> $[...]$


> The expectation that there exists a more intelligent theory consisting only of [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] objects in the [[large N limit|large Nc limit]] is thus realized via [[string theory]] in a somewhat surprising manner that the master fields, those truly physical degrees of freedom, actually live not in four dimensional Minkowskian world but in five or
higher dimensional curved geometry. This is not however completely unanticipated, and was heralded in the celebrated work by [Eguchi and Kawai in early 1980's](#EguchiKawai82) which is all the more remarkable in retrospect. 

> $[...]$

> To compare against actual [[QCD]], we must fix $[$the [['t Hooft coupling]] and the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification|KK]]-[[scale]]$]$ to fit
both the [[pion]] decay constant $f_\pi$ and the [[mass]] of the first [[vector meson]]. After this fitting, all other infinite number of [[masses]] and [[coupling constants]] are fixed. This version $[$the holographic [[WSS model]]$]$ of the [[holographic QCD]]  is extremely predictive.

> $[...]$

> $[$this$]$ elevates the classic [[skyrmion|Skyrme picture]] based on [[pions]] to a unified model involving all [[vector meson|spin one mesons]] in addition to [[pions]]. This is why the picture is extremely predictive. 

> As we saw in this note, for low momentum processes, such as soft [[pion]] [[scattering amplitude|processes]], soft [[rho meson]] exchanges, and soft elastic scattering of [[photons]], the $[$holographic [[WSS model|WSS]]-$]$model's predictions compare extremely well with experimental data. It is somewhat mysterious that the [[baryon]] sector works out almost as well as the [[meson]] sector
