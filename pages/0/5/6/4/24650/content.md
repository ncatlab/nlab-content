## Idea 

Similar to the construction of a [[quotient set]] from a [[set]] (i.e. [[h-set]]) with an [[equivalence relation]] as a [[higher inductive type]] in [[homotopy type theory]], there is a construction of a "quotient setoid" from a type with two equivalence relations, as a [[higher inductive-inductive type]]. 

This construction is reminiscent of the quotient set construction in set theory, because equality in set theory is defined in the foundations as a equivalence relation. The difference is that here we treat both equivalence relations on the same level, while in set theory one of the equivalence relations is given primacy as the default equality of the foundations. 

## Definition

Recall that an [[equivalence relation]] on a type $A$ is a type family $\sim$ consisting of dependent types $a \sim b$ indexed by objects $a:A$ and $b:A$, with witnesses of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, and (-1)-truncatedness
$$a:A \vdash \mathrm{refl}(a):(a \sim a)$$
$$a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{sym}(a, b):(a \sim b) \to (b \sim a)$$
$$a:A, b:A, c:A \vdash \mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(a \sim b) \times (b \sim c) \to (a \sim c)$$
$$a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\prod_{p:a \sim b} \prod_{q: a \sim b} p =_{a \sim b} q$$

A [[setoid]] is a type with an equivalence relation. 

Given a type $A$ with two equivalence relations $\equiv_A$ and $\sim_{A}$, the quotient setoid on $(A, \equiv_{A}, \sim_{A})$ is the higher inductive-inductive type inductively generated by a type $(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$ with a type family $\equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}}$, with the following constructors for $(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$:

* A function $f:A \to (A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$

and the following constructors for $\equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}}$:

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a function 
$$f_{\equiv_A}(a, b):(a \equiv_{A} b) \to (f(a) \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} f(b))$$

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a function 
$$f_{\sim_A}(a, b):(a \sim_{A} b) \to (f(a) \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} f(b))$$

* For each element $a:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, a witness 
$$\mathrm{refl}(a):(a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} a)$$

* For each element $a:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$ and $b:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, a witness
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b, c):(a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} b) \to (b \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} a)$$

* For each element $a:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, $b:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, and $c:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, a witness
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} b) \times (b \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} c) \to (a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} c)$$

* For each element $a:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$ and $b:(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}$, a witness
$$\mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\prod_{p:a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} b} \prod_{q: a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} b} p =_{a \equiv_{(A, \equiv_{A}) / \sim_{A}} b} q$$
