## Idea 

Similar to the construction of a [[quotient set]] from a [[set]] (i.e. [[h-set]]) with an [[equivalence relation]] as a [[higher inductive type]] in [[homotopy type theory]], there is a construction of a "quotient equivalence relation" from a type with two equivalence relations, as an [[higher inductive type]] family. 

This construction is reminiscent of the quotient set construction in set theory, because equality in set theory is defined in the foundations as a equivalence relation. The difference is that here we treat both equivalence relations on the same level, while in set theory one of the equivalence relations is given primacy as the default equality of the foundations. 

## Definition

Recall that an [[equivalence relation]] on a type $A$ is a type family $\sim$ consisting of dependent types $a \sim b$ indexed by objects $a:A$ and $b:A$, with witnesses of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, and (-1)-truncatedness
$$a:A \vdash \mathrm{refl}(a):(a \sim a)$$
$$a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{sym}(a, b):(a \sim b) \to (b \sim a)$$
$$a:A, b:A, c:A \vdash \mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(a \sim b) \times (b \sim c) \to (a \sim c)$$
$$a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\prod_{p:a \sim b} \prod_{q: a \sim b} p =_{a \sim b} q$$

Given a type $A$ with two equivalence relations $\equiv_A$ and $\sim_{A}$, the quotient equivalence relation on $(A, \equiv_{A}, \sim_{A})$ is the higher inductive type family $\equiv^{'}_{A}$ inductively generated by the following constructors:

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a function 
$$f_{\equiv_A}(a, b):(a \equiv_{A} b) \to (a \equiv^{'}_{A} b)$$

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a function 
$$f_{\sim_A}(a, b):(a \sim_{A} b) \to (a \equiv^{'}_{A} b)$$

* For each element $a:A$, a witness 
$$\mathrm{refl}(a):(a \equiv^{'}_{A} a)$$

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a witness
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b, c):(a \equiv^{'}_{A} b) \to (b \equiv^{'}_{A} a)$$

* For each element $a:A$, $b:A$, and $c:A$, a witness
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(a \equiv^{'}_{A} b) \times (b \equiv^{'}_{A} c) \to (a \equiv^{'}_{A} c)$$

* For each element $a:A$ and $b:A$, a witness
$$\mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\prod_{p:a \equiv^{'}_{A} b} \prod_{q: a \equiv^{'}_{A} b} p =_{a \equiv^{'}_{A} b} q$$
