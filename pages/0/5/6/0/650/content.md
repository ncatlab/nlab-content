A _$cat^n$-group_ is a strict [[n-category]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Grp]]. 

Regarding a [[group]] as a [[groupoid]] with a single object, this is the same as an [[n-fold category|(n+1)-fold groupoid]] in which in one direction all morphisms are endomorphisms.

#Special cases#

* A $cat^0$-group is a group.

* A [[cat-1-group]] is a strict [[2-group]].

#Remarks#

* Even though $cat^n$-groups are examples of strict [[n-category|n-categories]], Loday has shown that the [[homotopy category]] of $cat^n$-groups is equivalent to that of spaces which are pointed connected [[homotopy n-type]]s. Hence for $cat^n$-groups (thought of as $(n+1)$-fold groupoids) the [[homotopy hypothesis]] is true in this sense. See there for more details.

[[Tim Porter|Tim]] Is the first statement above correct? $Cat^n$-groups are examples of strict (n+1)-fold categories, not strict n=categories or am I missing something?

The original proof of Loday's result is to be found in

J.-L. Loday, _Spaces with finitely many homotopy groups_, J.Pure Appl. Alg., 24, (1982), 179 &#8211; 202.

There are one or two gaps in that proof and various patches and complete proofs were then given.

A proof using $cat^n$-groups and a neat detailed analysis of multisimplicial groups and related topics was given in

M. Bullejos, A. M. Cegarra. and J. Duskin, _On $cat^n$ -groups and homotopy types_, J. Pure Appl. Alg., 86, (1993), 135 &#8211; 154.

Porter gave a proof in terms of [[crossed n-cube]]s (and attempting to use as little high-powered simplicial techniques as possible) in

T. Porter, _n-types of simplicial groups and crossed n-cubes$, Topology, 32, (1993), 5 &#8211; 24.
