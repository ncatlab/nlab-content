A _$cat^n$-group_ is a strict [[n-category]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Grp]]. 

Regarding a [[group]] as a [[groupoid]] with a single object, this is the same as an [[n-fold category|(n+1)-fold groupoid]] in which in one direction all morphisms are endomorphisms.

#Special cases#

* A $cat^0$-group is a group.

* A [[cat-1-group]] is a strict [[2-group]].

#Remarks#

* Even though $cat^n$-groups are examples of strict [[n-category|n-categories]], Loday has shown that the [[homotopy category]] of $cat^n$-groups is equivalent to that of spaces which are pointed connected [[homotopy n-type]]s. Hence for $cat^n$-groups (thought of as $(n+1)$-fold groupoids) the [[homotopy hypothesis]] is true in this sense. See there for more details.
