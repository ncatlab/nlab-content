A _$cat^n$-group_ is a strict [[n-category]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Grp]]. 

Regarding a [[group]] as a [[groupoid]] with a single object, this is the same as an [[n-fold category|(n+1)-fold groupoid]] in which in one direction all morphisms are endomorphisms.

#Special cases#

* A $cat^0$-group is just a group.

* A [[cat-1-group]] is just a strict [[2-group]].
