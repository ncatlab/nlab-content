# Idea

A **pullback power** is the [[opposite category|dual]] concept to a [[pushout product]].  More precisely, a pushout product is defined with respect to a functor $E_1\times E_2 \to E_3$, while a pullback power is defined with respect to a functor $E_2^{op} \times E_3\to E_1$ or $E_1^{op}\times E_3 \to E_2$, of the sort that would be the right adjoints in a [[two-variable adjunction]].

Pullback powers and pushout products are related to [[factorization systems]] by the [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]].
