A **Hasse $n$-quiver** is a free [[n-poset]] on a [[Hasse n-graph]] ...

A Hasse 1-quiver is, as usual, referred to simply as a **Hasse quiver**.

Note: Toby's comment below refers to when the page was (badly) called "n-quiver". 

But a [[quiver]] is a $1$-[[1-category|category]] (a [[category]]), *not* a $1$-[[1-poset|poset]] (a [[poset]] or rather [[proset]]).  So here we are seeing that your $1$-quiver is not the same as a quiver.  Even if your idea is good, I do not like that terminology ....   ---Toby
