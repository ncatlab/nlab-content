An **$n$-quiver** is a free [[n-poset]] on an $n$-[[n-digraph|graph]] ...

But a [[quiver]] is a $1$-[[1-category|category]] (a [[category]]), *not* a $1$-[[1-poset|poset]] (a [[poset]] or rather [[proset]]).  So here we are seeing that your $1$-quiver is not the same as a quiver.  Even if your idea is good, I do not like that terminology ....   ---Toby
