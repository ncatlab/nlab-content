## Idea 

The idea of a commutative monad could be motivated as either

* The [[monad]] equivalent of a [[commutative algebraic theory]], generalized to either non-finitary theories or to categories other than [[Set]]. Intuitively, the operations involved have a commutativity property analogous to [[commutative monoid|the one that monoids can have]];
* A [[monad]] on a [[monoidal category]] whose underlying functor is [[monoidal functor|lax monoidal]], and whose unit and multiplication are [[monoidal natural transformation|monoidal]]. The interpretation is that the monad plays well with the monoidal product of the category, encoding for example products of formal expressions;
* A [[monad]] on a [[monoidal category]] whose [[strong monad|left-strength]] and [[strong monad|right-strength]] commute with each other. 

It turns out that all these concepts coincide (see below, as well as the articles on [[commutative algebraic theories]] and [[monoidal monads]]).


## Definition 

Let $(T,\mu,\eta)$ be a [[monad]] on a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$, equipped with a [[strong monad|left-strength]] $\sigma$ (and with the right-strength $\tau$ induced from $\sigma$ and the [[braiding]]). 

We say that $T$ (or $\sigma$) is **commutative** if the following diagram commutes for all objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$. 
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
]
& T X \otimes T Y \ar{dl}[swap]{\sigma} \ar{dr}{\tau} \\
T(T X \otimes Y) \ar{d}[swap]{T\tau} && T(X\otimes T Y) \ar{d}{T\sigma} \\
TT(X\otimes Y) \ar{dr}[swap]{\mu} && TT(X\otimes Y) \ar{dl}{\mu} \\
& T(X\otimes Y)
\end{tikzcd}

Note that this definition makes sense more generally in a [[monoidal category]], for a [[monad]] equipped with a (non-necessarily symmetric) [[strong monad|strength]].

## Properties

### Relation with monoidal monads 
 {#RelationWithMonoidalMoands}

The structure of a commutative monad is closely related to that of a [[monoidal monad]], namely a [[monad#definition|monad in the bicategory]] of [[monoidal categories]], [[lax monoidal functors]] and [[monoidal natural transformations]]. 

For the details see [this Proposition](monoidal+monad#BijectSymmMonoidalMonadsWithCommStrongMonads) at *[[monoidal monad]]*.


### On closed and monoidal closed categories

One can define [[strong monad|left-strength and right-strength]] on a [[closed category]], in a way that's analogous to the definition in a [[monoidal category]], and on [[monoidal closed categories]] the two definitions coincide (see [[strong monad#on_closed_and_monoidal_closed_categories|strong monad - on closed and monoidal closed categories]]). 
The same is true for the notion of commutativity: one can define commutative monads on closed categories, and on closed monoidal categories the definition coincides with the definition given in this article. 

More in detail, let $C$ be a [[closed category]], and denote its [[internal homs]] by $[X,Y]$. 
Let $t':[X,Y]\to [T X, T Y]$ be a left-strength for $T$ (as defined [[strong monad#strong_monads_are_enriched_monads|here]]), and let $s':T[X,Y]\to [X, T Y]$ be a right-strength (as defined [[strong monad#right-strength_and_pointwise_structure|here]]).
We say that $t'$ and $s'$ _commute_, or that $T$ is _commutative_, if the following diagram commutes.
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
]
& T{[X,Y]} \ar{dl}[swap]{s'} \ar{dr}{Tt'} \\
{[X,T Y]} \ar{d}[swap]{t'} && T{[T X, T Y]} \ar{d}{s'} \\
{[T X, T T Y]} \ar{dr}[swap]{{[T X,\mu]}} && {[T X, T T Y]} \ar{dl}{{[T X,\mu]}} \\
& {[T X, T Y]}
\end{tikzcd}
It can be shown by [[currying]] that on a [[monoidal closed category]], this condition is equivalent to the "monoidal" definition of commutativity.
A reference for this is [Kock '71, Section 2](#Kock71).


### Tensor product of algebras and multimorphisms

In many situations, [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] over a commutative monad are canonically equipped with a [[tensor product]] analogous to the [[tensor product of modules]] over a ring. 
In particular, commutative monads come equipped with a notion of [[multimorphisms]] of algebras, analogous to [[bilinear]] and [[multilinear maps]].

On a [[closed category]], analogously, the category of algebras inherits an [[internal hom]], just like the one of [[modules]]. If the category is [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed]], the [[tensor product]] and the [[internal hom]] are [[adjoint]] to each other, making the category of algebra itself monoidal closed. This, once again, generalizes the hom-tensor adjunction of [[modules]] and [[vector spaces]].

For the details, see [[tensor product of algebras over a commutative monad]], and the [[tensor product of algebras over a commutative monad#bimorphisms_and_universal_property|section on the universal property]] for multimorphisms, as well as [[internal hom of algebras over a commutative monad]].


## Examples

In many of the examples, one can see how the property of commutativity (as opposed to just the structure of a [[strong monad|strength]]) has really the meaning of the operations being commutative.

* The free _commutative_ monoid monad on [[Set]] is commutative, the free monoid monad is not.
* If $M$ is a [[monoid]], the [[action monad]] $X\mapsto M\times X$ on [[Set]] is commutative if and only if $M$ is commutative as a monoid. 
* More generally, in an arbitrary [[symmetric monoidal category]], the [[action monad]] induced by tensoring with an [[internal monoid]] is commutative if and only the monoid object is commutative. (See for example [Brandenburg, Example 6.3.12](#Brandenburg2014).)

Since commutative monads are the same as monoidal monads, monads encoding structures which admit products are commutative:

* Most [[probability monads]] are commutative, with monoidal structure given by forming the [[product probability]].
* The [[power set]] monad is commutative, with monoidal structure given by forming the product of subsets.


For a concrete example, consider the free commutative monoid monad $T$, and given a set $X$, write the elements of $TX$ as formal sums, such as $x_1+x_2$.  
The commutativity condition says that these two compositions have the same result,
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
row sep=0,%
]
TX \times TY \ar{r}{\sigma} & T(TX\times Y) \ar{r}{T\tau} & TT(X\times Y) \ar{r}{\mu} & T(X\times Y) \\
(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1+x_2, y_1) + (x_1+x_2, y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & ((x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_1)) + ((x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_2)) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_1) + (x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_2)
\end{tikzcd}
and
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
row sep=0,%
]
TX \times TY \ar{r}{\tau} & T(X\times TY) \ar{r}{T\sigma} & TT(X\times Y) \ar{r}{\mu} & T(X\times Y) \\
(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1+y_2) + (x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & ((x_1, y_1) + (x_1, y_2)) + ((x_2, y_1) + (x_2, y_2)) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1) + (x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_1) + (x_2, y_2)
\end{tikzcd}
Note that these two expressions are not the same on the nose, they are the same because addition is commutative.
