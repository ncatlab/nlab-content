There is an obvious functor

$$
  diff : LieGroups \to LieAlgebras
$$

which sends every Lie group to its Lie algebra and every homomorphism of Lie groups to the corresponding homomorphism of Lie algebras. Lie's three theorems establish the following properties of this functor.

  1. **Lie's first theorem** is today regarded as lacking a good notion of differentiable manifold;

  2. **Lie's second theorem** **$diff$ is [[k-surjectivity|full]]**: if $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups with Lie algebras $g = diff(G)$ and $h = diff(H)$, and if $f : g \to h$ is a morphism of Lie algebras, then there is a morphism $F : G \to H$ of Lie groups such that $f = diff(F)$.

  3. **Lie's third theorem** **$diff$ is surjective on objects**: to every Lie algebra  $g$ there is a Lie group $G$ such that $g = diff(G)$.
