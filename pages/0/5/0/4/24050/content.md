## Idea

By a condensed spectrum one should generally mean a *[[spectrum]]* in the context of [[condensed mathematics]], hence a [[condensed object in an (infinity,1)-category|condensed object]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[spectra]].

A very special case of this general notion has almost been considered in [Scholze (2019), Footnote 12](#ScholzeLCM): The condensed simplicial abelian groups alluded to there there may be understood, under the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]], to represent (the condensed version of) the particular case of [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[HZ|$H\mathbb{Z}$]]-[[module spectra]]. 

## Definition

A **condensed spectrum** is a [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[spectra]] on the [[pro-Ã©tale (infinity,1)-site]] of the point, small relative to a universe $\mathcal{U}$.

A discussion of condensed spectra in the literature seems not to be available yet. For general background on [[condensed mathematics]] see:
