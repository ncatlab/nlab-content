## Idea

By a condensed spectrum one should generally mean a *[[spectrum]]* in the context of [[condensed mathematics]], hence a [[condensed object in an (infinity,1)-category|condensed object]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[spectra]].

A special case of this general notion has essentially been considered in [Scholze (2019)](#ScholzeLCM): The condensed simplicial abelian groups discussed there may be understood, under the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]], to represent (the condensed version of) the particular case of connective [[HZ|$H\mathbb{Z}$]]-[[module spectra]]. 

## Definition

A **condensed spectrum** is a [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[spectra]] on the [[pro-Ã©tale (infinity,1)-site]] of the point, small relative to a universe $\mathcal{U}$.
