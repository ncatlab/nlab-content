## Idea and a bit of history

The aim of much of [[homotopy theory]] in the 1930s and 1940s was to try to lay _combinatorial_ foundations for determining whether two [[topological spaces]] were of the same [[homotopy type]] and, if so, was it possible to build up the homotopy equivalences in some simple way.  The model for this idea came, it seems, from [[Tietze transformation|Tietze's theorem]] in the theory of group presentations, where any presentation of a group could be deformed into any other by a series of 'moves'.  The same process was apparent in the development of the classification theorem for surfaces.  The question thus was: could one find some simple set of 'moves' that would generate all the homotopy equivalences with a given domain, $X$?

The theory was initially developed by Reidemeister, and then [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead]], culminating in his 1950 paper _Simple homotopy types_.  The theory received a further stimulus with [[John Milnor|Milnor]]'s classic paper in 1966 in which emphasis was put on [[elementary expansion]]s.

Further interesting approaches were developed by [[Eckmann]] and [[Siebenmann]] in 1970 (see references).

A more abstract approach to simple homotopy theory was explored in Cohen's book as well as in the papers by Eckmann, Eckmann and Maumary, and Siebenmann, listed above. Some of this is treated in
