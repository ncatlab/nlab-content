## Definition

Since every [[ordered local ring]] $R$ has [[characteristic zero]], the positive integers $\mathbb{Z}_+$ are a subset of $R$, with [[injection]] $i:\mathbb{Z}_+ \hookrightarrow R$. An **Archimedean ordered local ring** is an [[ordered local ring]] which satisfies the [[archimedean property]]: for all elements $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then there exists a positive integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that such that $a \lt i(n) \cdot b$. 

Unlike [[Archimedean ordered fields]], which require arithmetic [[Heyting pretoposes]], Archimedean ordered local rings are definable in any [[arithmetic pretopos]]. 

## In analysis

Archimedean ordered local $\mathbb{R}$-algebras are important for modeling notions of [[infinitesimals]]. These include the dual numbers, which represent nilsquare infinitesimals and are used to synthetically define [[differentiable functions]] in the real numbers, Archimedean ordered Weil $\mathbb{R}$-algebras, which represent nilpotent infintiesimals and are used to synthetically define [[smooth functions]] in the real numbers, as well as [[formal power series]] on $\mathbb{R}$, which represent infinitesimals which are not nilpotent and are used to synthetically define [[analytic functions]] in the real numbers. 

In addition, the set of [[Cauchy sequences]] of [[rational numbers]] is a [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] Archimedean ordered local ring whose [[residue field]] is the [[Cauchy real numbers]].
