## Idea

_Synthetic computability theory_ is the study of [[computability theory]] [[synthetic mathematics|synthetically]] [[axiom|axiomatized]] by [[structures]] present in the [[effective topos]] or other toposes of computable structures, rather than by [[analytic versus synthetic|analytic]] construction such as [[Turing machines]] or [[lambda calculus]].
