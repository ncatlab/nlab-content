_Nonabelian cosheaf homotopy_ is a notion in the context of [[nonabelian cohomology]]:

Given an [[higher category theory|infinity-category]]-valued (pseudo)copresheaf $\mathbf{B} : Spaces \to \infty-Cat$, its _homotopy_ $\pi(-,\mathbf{B})$ is the $\infty$-category valued (pseudo)copresheaf which assigns to each space the limit over all [[descent|codescent data]]:
$$
  \pi(X, \mathbf{B}) := lim_{Y^\bullet \to X}
  Codesc(Y^\bullet, \mathbf{B})
  \,.
$$
Here the limit is over all [[hypercover|hypercovers]] of $X$.

#Remarks#

* [[duality|Dual]] to nonabelian cosheaf homotopy is [[nonabelian sheaf cohomology]].

* A co-presheaf whose value on each space is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to its codescent $\infty$-category for any cover of that space is an [[infinity-stack|infinity-co-stack]].
