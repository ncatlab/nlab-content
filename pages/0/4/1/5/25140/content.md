## Idea

Given an [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ for $n \,\geq 1\,$, regarded under its standard [[unit sphere]] [[embedding]] into [[Cartesian space]] 

$$
  S^n 
  \;\subset\;
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \,\simeq\, \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \,,
$$

then a _meridian_ is any [[geodesic]] (great half-circle) from the "north pole" $\big(1,\vec 0\big)$ to the "south pole" $\big(-1,\vec 0\big)$ (or more generally between any [[pair]] of [[antipodes]]).

Hence the $n$-sphere may be regarded as the [[union]] of 

1. its north pole

1. its south pole

1. all meridians.

This decomposition exhibits the $n$-sphere as the (un-reduced) [[suspension]] of the $S^{n-1}$-sphere which is its [[equator]].
