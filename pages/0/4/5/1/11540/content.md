## Idea

Given a [[small category]] $C$, one can consider the [[category of presheaves]] $PSh(C, D)$ valued in some [[category]] $D$.  Given some assumptions on $D$, any [[functor]] of small categories $F : C \to C'$ induces two [[adjunction|adjoint pairs]]

  $$ F_! : PSh(C, D) \rightleftarrows PSh(C', D) : F^* $$

  $$ F^* : PSh(C', D) \rightleftarrows PSh(C, D) : F_* $$

## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $F : C \to C'$ be a functor of small categories and $D$ some category.  The **[[restriction of scalars]]** functor $F^* : PSh(C', D) \to PSh(C, D)$ is given by the formula $H \mapsto H \circ f$, i.e. mapping a [[presheaf]] $H : C'^{op} \to D$ to the composite
  $$C^{op} \stackrel{F}{\to} C'^{op} \stackrel{H}{\to} D.$$

###### Proposition

Suppose $D$ admits small [[colimits]] (resp. small [[limits]]).  Then the functor $F^*$ admits a [[left adjoint]] $F_!$ (resp. [[right adjoint]] $F_*$).

## Properties

###### Lemma

Let $F : C \rightleftarrows C' : G$ be an [[adjoint pair]] and consider the induced functors $(F_!, F^*, F_*)$ and $(G_!, G^*, G_*)$.  One has

* $F_!$ is left adjoint to $G_!$,
* $F^*$ is left adjoint to $G^*$,
* $F_*$ is left adjoint to $G_*$,
* $F_* = G^*$,
* $F^* = G_!$.

Note that all these claims are in fact equivalent.

###### Lemma
If $F$ is fully faithful, then so are $F_!$ and $F_*$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A left adjoint functor $L \dashv R$ is fully faithful precisely if $R L$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor (by the unit). Dually, $R$ is fully faithful precisely if $L R$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity (by the co-unit). Hence, it suffices to prove $F^* F_! \cong Id$, which by uniqueness of the right adjoint immediately implies that $F^* F_* \cong Id$ and thus proves both claims.

Being a left adjoint, $F^* F_!$ preserves colimits. Because every presheaf is a colimit of representable objects, it is sufficient to show that $F^* F_! y \cong y$ where $y$ is the Yoneda-embedding. We have
\[
(F^* F_! y I) J \cong (F^* y F I) J = (y F I) (F J) = Hom(F J, F I) \cong Hom(J, I) = (y I) J.
\]

The pseudofunctor PSh (with $-_!$ as its action on morphisms) takes a category to its [[free cocompletion]]. As such, it has the structure of a weak [[2-monad]], and more specifically it is a prototypical example of a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]]. It factors over its Eilenberg-Moore 2-category, the 2-category of ([[total category|total]]? [[cocomplete]]?) categories, as a [[lax-idempotent 2-adjunction]].
