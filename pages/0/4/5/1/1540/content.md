## Idea

A *finitely cocomplete category* is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ which admits all _finite_ [[colimits]], that is a colimit for any [[finite category|finite]] [[diagram]] $F \colon \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{C}$. 

(A category with all [[small category|small]] colimit is called a *[[cocomplete category]]*).

This is the notion [[formal dual|formally dual]] to that of *[[finitely complete categories]]*, see there for more.

Finitely cocomplete categories are also called **rex categories**, although this is rarer than 'lex' for [[finitely complete categories]].
