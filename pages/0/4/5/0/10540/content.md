A [[ring]] (or [[rig]], or [[nonassociative ring]], or indeed [[magma]] in any [[Ab-enriched category]]) is __formally real__ if, whenever
$$ \sum_i x_i^2 = 0 $$
(for a finite sum), each $x_i = 0$.

One generally speaks of __formally real algebras__ (possibly [[associative algebra|associative]], possibly [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative]]) over the [[real numbers]], but the concept has nothing to do with the $\mathbb{R}$-linear structure.  That said, the [[trivial ring|trivial algebra]] is the only formally real algebra over the [[complex numbers]]; more generally, if $A \to B$ is a [[monomorphism]] of rings (or of rigs, etc), then $A$ must be formally real if $B$ is.

Of course, the real numbers themselves form a formally real ring; the complex numbers do not, since
$$ \mathrm{i}^2 + 1^2 = 0 .$$

Formally real [[fields]] (like that of the real numbers) are particularly interesting; see [[formally real field]].
