A weak $\omega$-category is an [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic definition of ]] [[infinity-category]] whose underlying [[geometric shapes for higher structures|geometric shape for higher structures]] is the [[globe]].

#Examples#

* [[Trimble's notion of weak n-category]]

* [[Batanin's notion of weak omega-category]]

_[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]_: Hate to start this again... but why does $\omega$-category need to imply globular and algebraic?  If it's historical precedent we care about, then at the end of Street's "The algebra of oriented simplices" he was probably the first person to use "weak $\omega$-category," and he meant a simplicial and nonalgebraic version.

_[[Todd Trimble]]_: In my book, it doesn't (and I wasn't aware there was a controversy about this in nLab or anywhere else).
