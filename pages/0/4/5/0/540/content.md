Weak $\omega$-categories are examples of [[higher category theory|higher categories]], with essentially the same meaning as $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]].  The distinction between the terms "$\omega$-category" and "$\infty$-category" is mostly a matter of the preference of individual authors.  One slight difference is that $\infty$-category usually seems to imply a "weak" notion, while in addition to weak $\omega$-categories there are also [[strict omega-category|strict ones]].

#Examples#

* [[Trimble n-category|Trimble ∞-category]]
* [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak ∞-category]]
* [[Batanin ∞-category]]
