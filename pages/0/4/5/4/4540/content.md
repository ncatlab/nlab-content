## Idea

The notion of _$\infty$-Lie algebra cohomology_ generalizes the notion of [[Lie algebra cohomology]] from [[Lie algebra]]s to [[∞-Lie algebra]]s.

## Definition

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[∞-Lie algebra]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a [[cocycle]] on $\mathfrak{g}$ in degree $n$ with coefficients in the trivial module is a morphism

$$
  \mu : \mathfrak{g} \to b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Dually this is a [[dg-algebra]] morphism

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}) : \mu
$$

of [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s. here $CE(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})$ is the [[semifree dga]] on a single generator in degree $n$ with vanishing differential. So this is equivalently an element

$$
  \mu \in \wedge^n \mathfrak{g}^*
$$

which is closed in $CE(\mathfrak{g})$.

For the moment see

* [[Weil algebra]]

* [[invariant polynomial]]
