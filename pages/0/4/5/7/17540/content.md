Roger Godement (1 October, 1921 - July 21, 2016) was a French mathematician, specializing in [[functional analysis]] and especially [[harmonic analysis]], and with later interests in [[number theory]]. He was an active member of [[Bourbaki]] in the early 1950s, and wrote an influential book on [[sheaf theory]], *Topologie Alg&#233;brique et Th&#233;orie des Faisceaux* (1958), which contains a number of important [[category theory|category theoretic]] ideas, e.g., [[flabby sheaf|flasque resolution]], [[comonad]], and "five rules for functorial calculus" in which the notion of [[strict 2-category]] can be discerned.
