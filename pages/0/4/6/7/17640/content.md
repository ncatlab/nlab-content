A ring is (left) **coherent** if every finitely generated (left) ideal of this ring is finitely presented.   Equivalently, a ring is coherent if and only if it is a (left) [[coherent module]] over itself.

Every (left) [[noetherian ring]] is a coherent ring.  Lombardi and Quitt&eacute; argue that coherent rings are more suited to constructive mathematics than noetherian rings.  This is probably connected to the importance of [[coherent sheaves]].
