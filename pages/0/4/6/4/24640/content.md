Given an ample line bundle $H$ over a projective algebraic manifold, Gieseker $H$-stability conditions are the stability conditions for torsion-free coherent sheaves over projective algebraic manifolds generalizing say Mumford stability conditions for vector bundles over curves and used for similar reasons (building moduli spaces). These are in the setup of abelian categories rather than their derived categories where notions like [[Bridgeland stability]] are more appropriate.
