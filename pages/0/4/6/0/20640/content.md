## Idea

The _$p$-compact groups_ ([Dwyer-Wilkerson 94](#DwyerWilkerson94)) for some [[prime number]] $p$ are a class of [[∞-groups]] that shares crucial properties with the class of [[compact Lie groups]], without actually being compact Lie groups. Hence they are also called _homotopy Lie groups_ ([Møller 95](#Moller95)).

## Properties

### Classification

The classification of $p$-compact groups states that there is a [[bijection]] between [[isomorphism classes]] of [[connected topological space|connected]] [[p-compact groups]], and [[isomorphism classes]] of [[root]] data over the [[p-adic integers]] (as conjectured by [[Clarence Wilkerson]] and others, in various forms, since the early days of the theory).

This is completely analogous to the classification of [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact Lie groups]], under replacing the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ by the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

Specializing to $p=2$ one gets as a corollary that any [[classifying space]] $B X$ of a connected [[2-compact group]] $X$ splits as

$$
  B X \cong B G \times \big(B DI(4)\big)^s
$$


the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[p-completion|2-completion]] of the [[classifying space]] of the [[compact Lie group]] $G$, and $s$ copies of the [[Dwyer-Wilkerson space]] $B DI(4)$ for some $s$.

$DI(4) = $ [[G3]] corresponds to the finite $\mathbb{Z}_2$-reflection group which is number 24 on the Shepard-Todd list. It is the only irreducible finite complex reflection group which is realizable over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ but not $\mathbb{Z}$.
