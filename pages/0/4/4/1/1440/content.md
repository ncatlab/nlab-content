## Idea

A _derived smooth manifold_ is a [[structured generalized space]] given by a manifold whose structure sheaf of "smooth functions" is a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] [[generalized smooth algebra]].


## Definition

### $(\infty,1)$-smooth algebras -- simplicial $C^\infty$-rings

An **[[smooth (∞,1)-algebra]]** is an [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory|(∞,1)-algebra over the algebraic theory]] [[CartSp]]. This is the [[(∞,1)-category]] analog of the notion of [[smooth algebra]]: a product-preserving [[(∞,1)-functor]] $A : CartSp \to $ [[∞Grpd]].

In [Spiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5174) this is [[model category|modeled]] in terms of a [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on $CartSp^{op}$.

Derived smooth manifolds were defined in

* [[David Spivak]], _Quasi-smooth derived manifolds_, PhD thesis, Berkeley (2007) ([pdf](http://www.uoregon.edu/~dspivak/files/thesis1.pdf))

This original version of the PhD thesis essentially looks at [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es of [[∞-stack]]s on a [[topological space]] for the [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)|pregeometry]] given by $\mathcal{T} = $ [[Diff]].

The published version

* [[David Spivak]], _Derived smooth manifolds_ ([arXiv:0810.5174](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5174))

essentially does the same, but with [[Diff]] replaced by [[CartSp]]. Only that [[CartSp]] does not quite satisfy all the axioms of a pregeometry.
