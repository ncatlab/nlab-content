## Idea

A _derived smooth manifold_ is a [[structured generalized space]] given by a manifold whose structure sheaf of "smooth functions" is a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] [[generalized smooth algebra]].


## Definition

... just a second ...


## References

Derived smooth manifolds were defined in

* [[David Spivak]], _Quasi-smooth derived manifolds_, PhD thesis, Berkeley (2007) ([pdf](http://www.uoregon.edu/~dspivak/files/thesis1.pdf))

This original version of the PhD thesis sticks relatively close to the general theory of [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es developed in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Structured Spaces]]_ .

The later version

* [[David Spivak]], _Derived smooth manifolds_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5174))

emphasizes more the point of view of presheaf-copresheaves that also appears for similar reasons in the context of the [[Isbell envelope]].
