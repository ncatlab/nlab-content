#Idea#

A _derived smooth manifold_ is a [[structured generalized space]] given by a manifold whose structure sheaf of "smooth functions" is a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] [[generalized smooth algebra]].


#Definition#

... just a second ...


#References#

Derived smooth manifolds were defined in

* David Spivak, _Quasi-smooth derived manifolds_, PhD thesis, Berkeley (2007) ([pdf](http://www.uoregon.edu/~dspivak/files/thesis1.pdf))

This original version of the PhD thesis sticks relatively close to the general theory developed in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[structured generalized space|Structured spaces]] .

The later version

* David Spivak, _Derived smooth manifolds_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5174))

emphasizes more the point of view of presheaf-copresheaves that also appears for similar reasons in the context of the [[Isbell envelope]].
