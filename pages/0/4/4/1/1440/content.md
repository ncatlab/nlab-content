## Idea

A _derived smooth manifold_ is the generalization of a [[smooth manifold]] in the [[derived geometry]] over the [[Lawvere theory]] for [[smooth algebra]]s ($C^\infty$-rings):

it is a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] whose [[structure sheaf]] of functions is a [[smooth (∞,1)-algebra]].



## References

The definition of derived smooth manifolds is indicated at the very end of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Structured Spaces]]_ .

A detailed construction and discjussion in terms of the [[model category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] by [[homotopy T-algebra]]s is in
