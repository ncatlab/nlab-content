An homogeneous polynomial codifferential category is a $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded codifferential category]] which verifies a kind of [[Euler identity]]. It is conjectured that the only homogeneous polynomial codifferential categories are those given by actual [[homogeneous polynomials]] (in a sense precised below).
