In noncommutative case, [[determinant]]s are not useful invariants of [[matrix|matrices]] (in fact, various classical formulas for determinants disagree over noncommutative [[ring]]s) and other [[polynomial]] suggestions were not of much success (in some cases the [[superdeterminant]] and Dieudonn&#233;'s determinant are of use, but they can be easily expressed in terms of quasideterminants anyway). Quasideterminants will be noncommutative rational, rather than polynomial, expressions. 


## Definition

Let $A = (a^i_j)\in M_n(R)$ be an $n\times n$ matrix
over an arbitrary noncommutative (but unital and associative) [[ring]] $R$. In fact it makes sense to work with many objects (see [[horizontal categorification]]): having, say, an [[abelian category]] where $a^i_j$ is a morphism from the object $i$ to the object $j$. 
Let us choose a row label $i$ and a column label $j$.
By $A^{\hat{i}}_{\hat{j}}$ we'll denote the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix obtained
from $A$ by removing the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.
The $(i,j)$-th **quasideterminant** $|A|_{ij}$ is
\[ |A|_{ij} = a^i_j -
\sum_{k \neq i, l\neq j} a^i_l  (A^{\hat{i}}_{\hat{j}})^{-1}_{lk} a^k_j
\]
provided the right-hand side is defined (the corresponding inverses exist).


## Properties

Up to $n^2$ quasideterminants of a given $A \in M_n(R)$
may be defined. If all the $n^2$ quasideterminants $|A|_{ij}$ exist
and are invertible then the inverse $A^{-1}$ of $A$ exists in
$M_n(R)$ and

$$
(|A|_{ji})^{-1} = (A^{-1})^i_j.
$$

Quasideterminants for a matrix with entries in a commutative ring $R$ are, up to a sign,
ratios of the determinant of the matrix and the determinant
of the appropriate $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ submatrix, as one can see by remembering the formula for matrix inverse in terms of the cofactor matrices. For systems of linear equations with coefficients (from one side) in a noncommutative ring, there are solution formulas involving quasideterminants and generalizing Cramer's rule (hence left and right Cramer's rule). Quasideterminants with generic entries (entries in a free skewfield) satisfy generalizations of many classical identities: Muir's law of extensionality, Silvester's law, etc., and a new "heredity" principle and so-called "homological identities". Furthermore, for polynomial equations over noncommutative rings, noncommutative Viete's formulas have been found and used in applications.
