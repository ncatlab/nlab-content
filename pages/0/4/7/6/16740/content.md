**Richard Montague** (1930-1971) was an American logician. A student of [[Alfred Tarski]], Montague made important contributions to [[set theory]] and [[model theory]].

#### Contributions to natural language semantics

He is best known for his groundbreaking work in [[linguistics]]: his introduction of [[type theory]] and _generalized quantifiers_ achieved for _natural language semantics_ the same what [[Gottlob Frege]] had achieved almost a century earlier for the quantification theory of formal languages.

In fact, whereas Frege saw the surface position of quantifiers as a logical defect of natural languages which had to be amended for his _Begriffsschrift_, the powerful techniques of [[lambda calculus]] employed by Montague permitted to interpret quantifiers in situ as well, leading to a theory of linguistic interpretation, called _Montague grammar_, of a mathematical precision and elegance.

By restricting the analysis to language fragments, Montague overcome obstacles like the semantic paradoxes that prevented his teacher Tarski from applying model-theoretic methods to natural languages.
