## Idea

What is known as the *sine-Gordon equation* is the  [[partial differential equation]] on a [[scalar field]] on 1+1-[[dimension of a manifold|dimensional]] [[Minkowski spacetime]] which asserts that the value of its [[wave operator]] equals (minus) its [[sine]].

As such the name is a pun on the *[[Klein-Gordon equation]]* which  (also in higher [[spacetime]] dimension) has this same form except that in place of the [[sine]] there is a [[mass term]] (and possibly in addition a [[potential energy]], [[Lorentz force|gauge coupling]], etc.).

The sine-Gordon equation is an [[integrable model]] which admits [[soliton]] solutions. It is [[duality in physics|dual]], in some sense, to the [[Thirring model]].
