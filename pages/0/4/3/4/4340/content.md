## Idea

In [[logic]], the __true__ proposition, or __truth__, is the [[proposition]] which is the [[top element]] in the [[poset]] of [[truth values]].  

The truth is commonly denoted $T$, $\top$, or $1$.

In [[two-valued logic]], any truth value which is not true is [[false]].


## Definition

### In a topos

In terms of the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]], $true$ is the [[top element]] in the [[poset]] of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]].


## Examples

### In classical logic / in the topos $Set$

In the archetypical [[topos]] [[Set]], the terminal object is the [[singleton]] [[set]] $*$ and the poset of subobjects of that is $\{\emptyset \hookrightarrow *\}$. (See [Internal logic of Set](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal%20logic#LogicOfSet) for more details).

The same is true in the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]]. From that perspective it makes good sense to think of

* a set as a 0-[[truncated]] $\infty$-groupoid: a [[0-groupoid]];

* the empty or the singleton set as (-1)-[[truncated]] $\infty$-groupoids: a [[(-1)-groupoid]];

* the singleton set as the $(-2)$-[[truncated]] $\infty$-groupoid: the unique (up to equivalence) [[(-2)-groupoid]].

In this sense, the object $true$ in [[Set]] or [[∞Grpd]] may canonically be thought of as being [[generalized the|the]] unique [[(-2)-groupoid]].
