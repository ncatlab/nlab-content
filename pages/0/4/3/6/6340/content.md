## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of _index_ was originally defined

* _[For elliptic differential operators](#IdeaForDifferentialOperators)_

as an invariant correction of the [[kernel]] of such an operator (namely corrected by the [[cokernel]]). The definition has particularly nice properties in the special case

* _[For Dirac operators](#ForDiracOperators)_

where it coincides with the [[partition function]] of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]].

More generally the resulting notion is abstractly characterized as being the pairing operation ([[composition]])

* _[in KK-theory](#GeneralIdeaInKKTheory)_.

Even more generally, in [[generalized cohomology theory]] indices are given by [[genera]] and universal [[orientation in generalized cohomology]], such as for instance the [[elliptic genus]] for [[elliptic cohomology]] and the [[Witten genus]] for [[tmf]]. See at _[[genus]]_ for more on this generalized notion of indices.

### For elliptic differential and Fredholm operators
 {#IdeaForDifferentialOperators}

The _[[analytical index]]_ of an [[elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[differential operator]] $D \colon \Gamma(E_1) \to \Gamma(E_2)$ is defined to be the the difference between the [[dimension]] of its [[kernel]] and that of its [[cokernel]]. 

One reason why this is an interesting invariant of an elliptic differential operator is that when deforming the operator by a [[compact operator]] then the dimension of both the kernel and the cokernel may change, but their difference remains the same. Hence one may think of the analytic index as a "corrected" version of its [[kernel]], such as to make it be more invariant. 

On the other hand, the _[[topological index]]_ of an elliptic differential operator $D$, is defined to be the pairing of the [[cup product]] of its [[Chern character]] and the [[Todd class]] of the base manifold with its [[fundamental class]].

More generally such analytic and topological indices are defined for [[Fredholm operators]].

The _[[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]]_ assert that these two notios of index are in fact equal.

### For Dirac operators 
 {#ForDiracOperators}

If the [[Fredholm operator]] in question happens to be
a _[[Dirac operator]]_ $D$ (such as that encoding the
[[dynamics]] of a [[spinning particle]] or more generally the [[supercharge]] of a system in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]) then the index of $D$ coincides with the [[partition function]] of this quantum mechanical system, namely the [[super-trace]] of the [[heat kernel]] $\exp(-t D^2)$ of the corresponding [[Hamiltonian]] [[Laplace operator]] $D^2$ ([Berline-Getzler-Vergne 04](#BerlineGetzlerVergne04)).


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]] and $\mathcal{E}$ a smooth [[super vector bundle]] and indeed a [[Clifford module bundle]] over $X$. Consider a [[Dirac operator]] 

$$
  D \colon \Gamma(X,\mathcal{E}) \to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{E})
$$

with components (with respect to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space|grading]]) to be denoted

$$
  D = 
  \left[
    \array{
       0 & D^-
       \\
       D^+ & 0
    }
  \right]
  \,,
$$

where $D^- = (D^+)^\ast$. Then $D^+$ is a [[Fredholm operator]] and its index is the [[supertrace]] of the [[kernel]] of $D$, as well as of the [[heat kernel]] of $D^2$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    ind(D^+) & \coloneqq dim(ker(D^+)) - dim(coker(D^+))
   \\
   & = dim(ker(D^+)) - dim(ker(D^-))
   \\
   & = sTr(ker(D))
   \\
   & = sTr( \exp(-t \, D^2) ) \;\;\; \forall t \gt 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

The last step here follows from an argument which is as simple as it is paramount whenever anything involves [[supersymmetry]]:

the point is that if a (hermitean) operator $H$ has a [[supercharge]] $D$, in that $H = D^2$, then all its non-vanishing [[eigenstates]] appear in "[[supermultiplet]]" pairs of the same eigenvalue: if $|\psi\rangle$ has [[eigenvalue]] $E \gt 0$ under $H$, then 

1. $D |\psi\rangle \neq 0$ (since $D D |\psi\rangle = H |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle \neq 0$);

1. also $D |\psi\rangle$ has eignevalue $E$ (since $[H,D] = 0$).

Therefore all eigenstates for non-vanishing eigenvalues appear in pairs whose members have opposite sign under the supertrace. 
So only states with $H |\psi\rangle = 0$ contribute to the supertrace. But if $H$ and $D$ are hermitean operators for a non-degenerate inner product, then it follows that $(D^2 |\psi\rangle = 0) \Leftrightarrow (D|\psi\rangle = 0)$ and hence these are precisely the states which are also annihilated by the supercharge (are in the kernel of $D$), hence are precisely only the _supersymmetric states_.

On these now the weight $\exp(- t D^2) = 1$ and hence the supertrace over this "Euclidean propagator" simply counts the number of supersymmetric states, signed by their fermion number.

###### Remark

If one thinks of $D^2$ as the time-evolution [[Hamiltonian]] of a system of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] with $D$ the [[supercharge]] on the [[worldline]], then $ker(D)$ is the space of supersymmetric [[quantum states]], $\exp(-t \, D^2)$ is the Euclidean time evolution operator and its [[supertrace]] is the [[partition function]] of the system. Hence we have the translation

*  index = partition function .

This kind of argument appears throughout supersymmetric quantum field theory. In dimension 2 it controls the nature of the [[Witten genus]].

### General abstract definition in KK-theory
 {#GeneralIdeaInKKTheory}

The abstract [[universal property|universal]] characterization of indices is: the index is the _pairing_ in [[KK-theory]]/[[E-theory]].

More in detail, by the discussion there [[KK-theory]] ([[E-theory]]) is the [[category]] $KK$ which is the additive and split exact [[localization]] of the category [[C*Alg]] of [[C*-algebras]] at the [[compact operators]]. For $\mathbb{C}$ the base [[C*-algebra]] of [[complex numbers]] the [[morphisms]] in this category have the following equivalent meaning:

* [[morphisms]] $\mathbb{C} \to A$ are [[operator K-theory|operator K-cohomology]] classes which are represented by "[[vector bundles]] over the space represented by $A$", namely by [[Hilbert modules]] $E$ over $A$;

* [[morphisms]] $A \to \mathcal{C}$ are [[K-homology]] classes which are represented by [[Fredholm operators]] $D$;

* the [[composition]] 

  $$
    ind(D_E) 
      \;\colon\;
    \mathbb{C} \stackrel{E}{\to} A \stackrel{D}{\to} \mathbb{C}
    \;\;\;\;
    \in KK(\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  $$

  in the category $KK$ (hence the Kasparov product) is the _index_ of the Fredholm operator $D$ twisted by $E$.

More generally, if $B$ is some other chosen base [[C*-algebra]] then $KK(A,B)$ is the group of [[Fredholm operators]] $D$ on [[Hilbert module]] bundles over the [[C*-algebra]] $B$, and one takes the pairing

$$
  ind \coloneqq \circ_{\mathbb{C}, A, B} \;\colon\;
  KK(\mathbb{C},A) \times KK(A,B) \to KK(\mathbb{C}, B)
$$

to be the index map relative $B$. (See e.g. [Schick 05, section 6](#Schick05).) This is the case that the [[Mishchenko-Fomenko index theorem]] applies to.

And hence even more generally one may regard _any_ composition in $KK$ as as a generalized index map. Via the universal characterizatin of $KK$ itself, this then gives a fundamental and general abstract characterization of the notion of index:

_The index pairing is the [[composition]] operation in the [[KK-theory|KK-]][[localization of a category|localization]] of [[C*Alg]], hence in [[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]].
