## Definition

### Of a subset of a topological space

For $S \subset X$ a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] $X$, the **boundary**  $\partial S$ of $S$ is its [[closure]] $\bar S$ minus its [[interior]] $S^\circ$:

$$
  \partial S = \bar S \backslash S^\circ
$$

### Of a manifold

In a [[manifold with boundary]] of [[dimension]] $d$ the boundary is the collection of points whose [[neighbourhood]] is not [[diffeomorphic]] to an [[open n-ball]], but to a half-ball.
