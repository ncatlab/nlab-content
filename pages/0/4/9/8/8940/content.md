## Definition

A [[category]] is called **gaunt** if all its [[isomorphisms]] are in fact [[identities]]. This is really a property of [[strict categories]]; that is, it is not [[principle of invariance|invariant]] under [[equivalence of categories]]. Gaunt categories are necessarily [[skeletal]]; a skeletal category is gaunt iff every [[automorphism]] is an [[identity morphism]].


## Properties

### Relation to complete Segal spaces

The [[nerve]] [[simplicial set]] of a [[category]], regarded as a [[simplicial object]] in [[homotopy types]] under the inclusion $Set \hookrightarrow \infty Grpd$, is a _[[complete Segal space]]_ precisely if the category is gaunt. More discussion of this is at _[Segal space -- Examples -- In Set](Segal%20space#InSetByNervesOfCategories)_.

In the [[Elephant]], gaunt categories are briefly mentioned under the name "stiff categories", in the paragraph preceding B1.3.11 (about [[split fibration|splitting]] of [[Grothendieck fibrations]]).
