An __$A$-coring__ is a [[comonoid]] in the monoidal category of [[bimodule]]s over a fixed (typically noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $A$. It generalizes $A$-[[coalgebra]]s which are defined only if $A$ is commutative and where the bimodules in question are [[central bimodule|central]]. The classical example of a coring is the [[Sweedler coring]] corresponding to an extension $R\hookrightarrow S$ of unital rings. The category of descent data for this extension is equivalent to the category of comodules over the Sweedler coring. Another major class of examples are so-called [[matrix coring]]s.

The notion of coring is introduced by M. Sweedler and recently lived through a renaissance in works of T. Brzezi&#324;ski, R. Wisbauer, G. B&#246;hm, L. Kaoutit, G&#243;mez-Torrecillas, S. Caenepeel, J. Y. Abuhlail, J. Vercruysse and others, including the creation of Galois theory for corings. Some prefer to speak about $A$-[[cocategory|cocategories]].
