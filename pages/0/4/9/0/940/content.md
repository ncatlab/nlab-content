An __$A$-coring__ is a [[comonoid]] in the monoidal category of [[bimodule]]s over a fixed (typically noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $A$. It generalizes $A$-[[coalgebra]]s which are defined only if $A$ is commutative and where the bimodules in question are [[central bimodule|central]]. The classical example of a coring is the [[Sweedler coring]] corresponding to an extension $R\hookrightarrow S$ of unital rings. The category of descent data for this extension is equivalent to the category of comodules over the Sweedler coring. Corings are in general useful for the treatment of the [[descent in noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

Another major class of examples are so-called [[matrix coring]]s.

The notion of an $A$-coring is introduced by M. Sweedler and recently lived through a renaissance in works of T. Brzezi&#324;ski, R. Wisbauer, G. B&#246;hm, L. Kaoutit, G&#243;mez-Torrecillas, S. Caenepeel, J. Y. Abuhlail, J. Vercruysse and others, including the creation of Galois theory for corings. Some prefer to speak about $A$-[[cocategory|cocategories]].

There is already a monograph:
