$A$-coring is a comonoid in the monoidal category of bimodules over a fixed (typically noncommutative) unital ring $A$. It generalizes $A$-coalgebras which are defined only if $A$ is commutative and where the bimodules in question are central. The classical example of a coring is the [[Sweedler coring|Sweedler coring]] corresponding to the extension $R\hookrightarrow S$ of unital rings. The category of descent data for this extension is equivalent to the category of comodules over the Sweedler coring. Another major class of examples are so-called matrix corings.

The notion of coring is introduced by M. Sweedler and recently lived through a rennesaince in works of T. Brzezi&#324;ski, R. Wisbauer, G. B&#246;hm, L. Kaoutit, G&#243;mez-Torrecillas, S. Caenepeel, J. Y. Abuhlail, J. Vercruysse and others, including the creation of Galois theory for corings. Some prefer to speak about $A$-[[cocategory]].

There is already a monograph:
