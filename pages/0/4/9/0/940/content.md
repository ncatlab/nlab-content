## Idea

The notion of coring is a generalization of that of [[coalgebra]]. 

Whereas a coalgebra structure is defined on a [[vector space]] -- which may be regarded as a [[bimodule]] over the ground field -- a coring structure is defined on a bimodule over a general [[ring]].

## Definition

An __$A$-coring__ is a [[comonoid]] in the [[monoidal category]] of [[bimodule]]s over a fixed (typically noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $A$. 

This generalizes the notion of $A$-[[coalgebra]]s which are defined only if $A$ is commutative and where the bimodules in question are [[central bimodule|central]]. 

## Examples

### Sweedler corings

The classical example of a coring is the [[Sweedler coring]] corresponding to an extension $R\hookrightarrow S$ of unital rings. The category of [[descent]] data for this extension is equivalent to the category of [[comodule]]s over the Sweedler coring. 

Corings are in general useful for the treatment of the [[descent in noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

### Matrix corings

Another major class of examples are so-called [[matrix coring]]s.

## References

The notion of an $A$-coring is introduced by M. Sweedler and recently lived through a renaissance in works of T. Brzezi&#324;ski, R. Wisbauer, G. B&#246;hm, L. Kaoutit, G&#243;mez-Torrecillas, S. Caenepeel, J. Y. Abuhlail, J. Vercruysse and others, including the creation of Galois theory for corings. Some prefer to speak about $A$-[[cocategory|cocategories]].
