## Idea

Generally, the term _Mackey functor_ refers to an [[additive functor]] from a ([[subcategory]] of) a [[category of correspondences]] (in a [[disjunctive category]] $\mathcal{C}$) to possibly any other [[additive category]] which however usually is the "base" abelian category. More generally the term now refers to the fairly obvious [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] or [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] refinements of this concept.

Therefore the concept of Mackey functors is similar to that of [[sheaves with transfer]] and as such appears (implicitly) in the discussion of [[motives]] (explicitly e.g. in [Kahn-Yamazaki 11, section 2](#KahnYamazaki11), where $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of suitable [[schemes]]).

Specifically, the concept was introduced and named as such in the context of [[representation theory]] ([Dress 71](#Dress71)) and [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant cohomology]] ([May 96](#May96)). Here the underlying [[category of correspondences]] is that in [[finite set|finite]] [[G-sets]], called the _[[Burnside category]]_.  

The [[equivariant homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(E)$ of a (genuine) [[G-spectrum]] $E$ organize into a Mackey functor on the [[Burnside category]] with values in [[abelian groups]]. This plays a key role in the [[equivariant Whitehead theorem]].  In fact, genunine [[G-spectra]] themselves are equivalent to Mackey [[(∞,1)-functors]] from the [[Burnside category]] to the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] ([GuillouMay 11](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).


## Definition

### In higher category theory
We follow the account in ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)), which incarnates a perspective of ([Lindner 76](#Lindner76)) in higher category theory.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[disjunctive (∞,1)-category]] and write $\Span(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of correspondences]] in $\mathcal{C}$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with finite products.

Then an _$\mathcal{A}$-valued Mackey functor_ on $\mathcal{C}$ is a product-preserving functor

$$
  M \;\colon\; \Span(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}
  \,.
$$

Notice that this means that $M$ is in particular:


1. a covariant [[(∞,1)-functor]] $(-)_\ast \colon\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. a contravariant [[(∞,1)-functor]], hence  $(-)^\ast \colon\mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. satisfy the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

In order to understand the Beck-Chevalley condition, note that disjunctiveness of $\mathcal{C}$ implies that $\Span(\mathcal{C})$ is [[semiadditive (∞,1)-category|semiadditive]]. 

(More generally one may specify suitably chosen sub-$(\infty,1)$-categories $\mathcal{C}^\dagger, \mathcal{C}_\dagger \subset \mathcal{C}$ and restrict $\Span(\mathcal{C})$ to [[correspondences]] whose left leg is in $\mathcal{C}_\dagger$ and whose right leg is in $\mathcal{C}^\dagger$ ([Barwick 14, section 5](#Barwick14)).)

### In representation theory

In order to recover the original definition of [Dress 71](#Dress71), we fix $G$ a finite group, and we let $\mathbb{F}_G$ be the (disjunctive) category of finite $G$-sets.
Then, the above definition specializes to $G$ by defining $G$-Mackey functors as product-preserving functors

$$
   M \;\colon\; \Span(\mathbb{F}_G) \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}
  \,.
$$ 

$\Span(\mathbb{F}_G)$ has [[biproducts]] given by disjoint unions of finite $G$-sets;
when $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[semiadditive category]], such a functor may be decompiled into

1. a covariant functor $(-)_\ast \colon \mathcal{O}_G \to \mathcal{A}$ and

2. a contravariant functor $(-)^\ast \colon \mathcal{O}_G^{\op} \to \mathcal{A}$, subject to the conditions that
 
3. there exists a non-natural isomorphism $(-)_\ast \simeq (-)^\ast$, and

4. writing $R^H_J$ for the contravariant effect of in inclusion $J \subset H$ and $I^H_J$ for the covariant effect, $M$ satisfies the double coset formula
$$
  R_J^H I_K^H(-) \simeq \bigoplus_{x \in [J\backslash H/K]} I_{J \cap ^x K}^J R_{J^x \cap K}^{K}(-)
$$
for all $J,K \subset H$, where $^x K \coloneqq xKx^{-1}$.


## Examples

### In representation theory

For $\mathcal{A}$ taken to be (the [[derived category]]) of an [[abelian category]] (or better: postcomposed with a [[homological functor]] ) this definition reduces ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) to that of Mackey functors as originally defined in ([Dress 71](#Dress71)).
Fixing $G$ a finite group, we acquire the following examples (see section 3.2 of [Blumberg 17](#Blumberg17)).

1. Let $R \in \mathcal{A}$ be an object in $\mathcal{A}$. Then, the **constant Mackey functor** $\underline{R}$ assigns $R$ to every transitive $G$-set, whose restriction maps are all the identity, and whose transfer maps $G/H \rightarrow G/K$ are multiplication by $\left| H/K \right|$.

2. The **Burnside Mackey functor** $A(G)$ is defined by letting $A(G)([G/H])$ be the [[Grothendieck group]] of the cocartesian symmetric monoidla category of finite $H$-sets, with restriction and transfer given by restriction and induction, respectively.

3. The **representation Mackey functor** $R(G)$ is defined by letting $R(G)([G/H])$ be the [[Grothendieck group]] of the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional $H$-representations,  with restriction and transfer given by restriction and induction,  respectively.


### Equivariant spectra 
 {#EquivariantSpectra}

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]]. Let $\mathcal{C}= \mathbb{F}_G$ be the category of finite [[G-sets]]. Then $Corr_1(\mathcal{C})$ is essentially what is called the [[Burnside category]] of $G$ (possibly after abelianizing/stabilizing the hom-spaces suitably, but as ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) highlights, this is unnecessary when one is mapping out of this into something abelian/stable, as is the case here).

For $G$ finite, Mackey functors on $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalent to  genuine [[G-spectra]] ([Guillou-May 11, theorem 0.1](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14, below example B.6](#Barwick14)) (Notice that this equivalence does not in general hold if $G$ is not a finite group.)



(...)
 
For $E$ a [[genuine G-spectrum]], the corresponding spectral Mackey functor is given by the [[fixed point spectra]] of $E$

$$
  G/H \mapsto E(G/H) =  [\Sigma^\infty_+ G/H, E]^G \simeq E^H
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the $G$-equivariant [[mapping spectrum]] from the [[equivariant suspension spectrum]] of the [[transitive action|transitive]] [[G-set]] $G/H$ to $E$.

(e.g. ([Guillou-May 11, remark 2.5](#GuillouMay11)), see also ([Schwede 15, p. 16](#Schwede15)) for restriction and section 4 culminating on p. 37 for transfer and compatibility).

Further, the corresponding abelian-group valued Mackey functor is

$$
  \pi_n(E) \colon G/H \mapsto [G/H_+\wedge S^n, X]_G
  \,,
$$

where now on the right we have just the [[homotopy classes]] of maps, i.e. the morphisms in the [[equivariant stable homotopy category]] (e.g. [Greenlees-May 95, p. 43](#GreenleesMay95))


(...)

## Cohomology with coefficients in a Mackey functor
 {#Cohomology}

We discuss [[cohomology]] of [[topological G-spaces]] with [[coefficients]]
in a Mackey functor, following notation and conventions as in ([May 96, sections IX, X](#May96)). See also ([Greenlees-May 95, p. 9](#GreenleesMay95)).


+-- {: .num_defn #CohomologyOfGSpace}
###### Defininition

For $X$ a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[G-CW complex]], define the [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ of Mackey functors to be given by the stable [[equivariant homotopy groups]] of the quotient spaces $X^{\bullet}/X^{\bullet-1}$:

$$
  C_n(X) \coloneqq \pi_n(X^n/X^{n-1})
  \,,
$$

Then for $A$ any Mackey functor, the ordinary cohomology of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ is the [[cochain cohomology]] of the complex of homs of Mackey functors $C_n(X) \to A$:

$$
  H_G^n(X,A) \coloneqq H^n( Hom(C_\bullet(X), A) )
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $V$ a G-[[representation]], the $(n-V)$-[[RO(G)-grading|RO(G)-graded]] cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is

$$
  H_G^{n-V}(X,A) = H_G^n(S^V \wedge X,A)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The corresponding [[reduced cohomology]] $\tilde H^n(-,A)$ is represented by maps into the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space|Eilenberg-MacLane G-space]]:

$$
  \tilde H^n(X,A) \simeq [X,K(A,n)]_G
  \,.
$$
