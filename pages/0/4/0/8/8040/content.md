## Idea

The Mathieu groups, denoted $M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ are five of the [[sporadic finite simple groups]] in the [[Happy Family]]. They were first described in the 1860-70s by &#201;mile Mathieu, and the first such groups to be discovered.

They arise as the [[automorphism groups]] of [[Steiner systems]]. The [[order of a group|orders]] of the groups are as follows:

* $M_{11}$ - 7920;
* $M_{12}$ - 95040;
* $M_{22}$ - 443520;
* $M_{23}$ - 10200960;
* $M_{24}$ - 244823040;

The Matthieu group $M_{24}$ is the [[automorphism group]] of the [[binary Golay code]]; this is a [[vector space]] over the [[field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$. The other groups can be obtained as stabilisers of various (sets of) elements of the Golay code, and hence are subgroups of $M_{24}$. The Mathieu groups form the so-called _first generation_ of the _happy family_: the collection of 20 sporadic groups which are subgroups of the [[Monster group]].
