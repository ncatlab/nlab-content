The connected sum of boxed knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ denoted by $ K_1 # K_2 $ , is obtained by joining the boxes containing them.

\begin{theorem}

The connected sum operation is associative and commutative:
$ K_1 # K_2 = K_2 # K_1 $,
$ ( K_1 # K_2 ) # K_3 = K_1 # ( K_2 # K_3 ) $.

There are no inverse elements under the connected sum operation,
i.e.,
$K # K' = \circ \implies K = K' = \circ $,
where $\circ $ is the unknot.

The operation is associative and commutative.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}

There is a canonical bijection between the equivalence
classes of boxed knots and the isotopy equivalence classes of oriented knots.

\end{proposition}

This bijection gives the connected sum of two ordinary knots.
