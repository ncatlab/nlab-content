The _universal fibration of [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] is the [[generalized universal bundle]] of $(\infty,1)$-categories in that it is the fibration

$$
  p : Z \to (\infty,1)Cat
$$

over the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]] whose fiber  $p^{-1}(C)$ over $C \in (\infty,1)Cat$ is just the $(\infty,1)$-category $C$ itself.


Recall from the discussion at [[generalized universal bundle]] that for [[n-category|n-categories]] at least for low $n$ the corresponding universal object was the $n$-category $n Cat_*$ of [[pointed object|pointed]] $n$-categories. $Z$ should at least morally be $(\infty,1)Cat_*$.
