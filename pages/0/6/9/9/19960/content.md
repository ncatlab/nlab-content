What is called _holographic QCD_ or _AdS/QCD correspondence_ or similar (review includes [Aharony 02](#Aharony02), [Erlich 09](#Erlich09), [Kim-Yi 11](#KimYi11), [Erlich 14](#Erlich14), [Rebhan 14](#Rebhan14), [Rho-Zahed 16](#RhoZahed16)) is a quantitatively predictive [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] for [[quantum chromodynamics]] ("[[QCD]]", the [[strong nuclear force]]-sector of the [[standard model of particle physics]]) via "holography" (as in the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]), hence regarding it as the [[boundary field theory]] of an (at least) [[D=5 super Yang-Mills theory|5-dimensional]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] ("[[bottom-up model building|bottom-up]] holographic QCD"), specifically one [[geometric engineering|geometrically engineered]] on [[intersecting D-brane model|intersecting D-branes]] ("[[top-down model building|top-down]] holographic QCD") and here specifically on [[D4-D8 brane intersections]] (the _[[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]]_ due to [Witten 98](#Witten98), [Karch-Katz 02](#KarchKatz02), [Sakai-Sugimoto 04](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05](#SakaiSugimoto05)). 


Holographic QCD captures the [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[confinement|confined]] regime of [[QCD]], which is otherwise elusive (the [[mass gap problem|Mass Gap Millennium Problem]]), where the would-be [[quarks]] are all [[bound state|bound]]/[[confinement|confined]] inside [[color charge|color]]-less [[hadrons]], with the [[meson]] [[field (physics)|fields]] instead being the [[gauge field]] of a [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]-[[chiral perturbation theory|gauge theory]] (holographic dictionary, e.g. [Kim-Yi 11 (3.1)](#KimYi11), see also "[[hidden local symmetry]]") and the [[baryons]] being [[solitons]] of this flavour/meson field, namely _[[skyrmions]]_.

This [[duality in physics|dual]] description of the [[color charge|color]] [[gauge theory]] of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] instead as [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] [[gauge theory]] of [[baryons]] and [[mesons]] is [[geometric engineering of QFT|geometrically brought out]] by the [[D4-D8 brane intersections]] of the [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model|Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto]] [[intersecting D-brane model]]: Here the [[open strings]] on the [[D4-branes|D4]] _[[color branes]]_ give the [[color charge|color]]/[[gluon]] gauge field, while those on the [[D8-brane|D8]] _[[flavor branes]]_ give the [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]/[[meson]] gauge field, those stretching between D4 and D8 give the [[quarks]] and the [[closed strings]] give the [[glueballs]].
(See at _[WSS brane configuration](#WSSBraneConfiguration)_ below.) This way [[color charge|color]]/[[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] [[duality in physics|duality]] is mapped to [[open/closed string duality]] (as the [[D8-branes]] are treated as probe branes).
 

Notice that the [[flavour physics|flavour sector]] is where most of the open problems regarding the [[standard model of particle physics]] are located ([[flavour problem]], [[flavour anomalies]]).

Various fundamental characteristics of [[QCD]] that remain mysterious in the [[color charge|colored]]-[[quark]] model readily find a conceptual explanation in terms of this [[geometric engineering of QFT|geometric engineering]] of  [[flavour physics]], notably the phenomena of [[confinement]] and of [[chiral symmetry breaking]], but also for instance [[vector meson dominance]] and the [[Cheshire cat principle]].

Indeed, holographic QCD gives accurate quantitative predictions of [[confinement|confined]] [[hadron]] spectra, hence of the physics of ordinary [[atomic nuclei]] (see comparison between [[experiment]] and predictions of holographic QCD [below](#BottomUpModels)) which is out of reach for [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbation theory]] and otherwise computable, at best, via the blind numerics of [[lattice QCD]]. This means ([Witten 98](#Witten98)) that holographic QCD provides a conceptual solution to the _[[mass gap problem]]_ (not yet a rigorous proof, but a proof strategy).

Concretely, much of the [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] success of [[holographic QCD]] is (review in [Rho-Zahed 16, Chapter III](#RhoZahed16)) due to the holographic emergence of the time-honored but _ad hoc_ [[Skyrmion]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] of [[baryons]], as [[solitons]] in the [[meson]] [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]-[[gauge field]].

Moreover, in holographic QCD this [[Skyrmion]] model of [[baryons]] emerges in its modern improved form, where the [[pion]] [[field (physics)|field]] is accompanied by the whole tower of [[vector mesons]] (the [[rho meson]] etc.): these [[meson]] species are holographically unified as the transversal [[KK-mechanism|KK-modes]] in the holographic theory. Already just adjoining the [[rho meson]] to the [[pion]] makes the resulting [[Skyrmions]], and hence holographic QCD, give accurate results for light [[nuclei]] all the way up to  [[carbon]] ([Naya-Sutcliffe 18a](Skyrmion#NayaSutcliffe18a), [Naya-Sutcliffe 18b](Skyrmion#NayaSutcliffe18b)).

    "caption": "From [Naya-Sutcliffe 18](Skyrmion#NayaSutcliffe18)"
\end{imagefromfile}


The mechanism behind this description of [[baryons]] and [[nuclei]] via [[holographic QCD]] is the theorem of [Atiyah-Manton 89](skyrmion#AtiyahManton89) (highlighted as such in [Sutcliffe 10](skyrmion#Sutcliffe10)) which identifies [[Skyrmions]] in 3+1-dimensional [[Yang-Mills theory]] with [[Kaluza-Klein 
mechanism|KK modes]] (transversal [[holonomies]]) of [[instantons]] in 4+1-dimensional YM theory:

$$
  \text{baryons}
  \;\;
  \overset{\text{Skyrme}}{\leftrightarrow}
  \;\;
  {
    {\text{Skyrmions}}
    \atop
    {\text{in}\; d=3+1}
  }
  \;\;
  \overset{\text{Atiyah-Manton}}{\leftrightarrow}
  \;\;
  {
    {\text{Instantons}}
    \atop
    {\text{in}\; d=4+1}
  }
$$

This fact (of [[experiment]]/[[phenomenology]] on the left and of [[mathematics]] on the right) combined with the emergence of [[strings]] in the [['t Hooft limit]] of [[QCD]] reveals a _de facto_ [[AdS/CFT correspondence|holographic]] nature of [[QCD]]. The task in [[holographic QCD]] is to sort out the fine-print.

{#SmallNOpenProblem} A key open problem here is that the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] is currently well understood only in the [[large N limit]], where the number $N_c$ of [[color charge|colors]] and the [['t Hooft coupling]] $\lambda$ are both large. But for [[QCD]] the number of colors is small, $N_c = 3$.  While the correspondence is thought to hold also in the [[small N limit]], here the [[classical field theory|classical]] [[supergravity|super]]-[[gravity]]-computations on the dual (AdS) side will receive [[small N limit|small-N corrections]] (highlighted for holographic QCD e.g. in [Sugimoto 16](#Sugimoto16), see references [below](#StringAndMTheoryCorrection)) from [[perturbative string theory]] (for small [['t Hooft coupling]]) which are hard to compute, and then from [[M-theory]] (for small $N_c$) which are largely unknown, as [formulating M-theory remains an open problem](M-theory#TheOpenProblem). Hence from the perspective of [[small N limit|small-N corrected]] [[holographic QCD]], the [[mass gap problem]]/[confinement problem](confinement#OpenProblem) translates to the problem of formulating [[M-theory]]:

From [Yi 09](#Yi09):

> [[QCD]] is a challenging theory. Its most interesting aspects, namely the [[confinement]] of [[color charge|color]] and the [[chiral symmetry breaking]], have defied all analytical approaches. While there are now many data accumulated from the [[lattice gauge theory]], the methodology falls well short of giving us insights on how one may understand these phenomena analytically, nor does it give us a systematic way of obtaining a low energy theory of [[QCD]] below the [[confinement]] [[scale]]. 

> $[...]$

> it has been proposed early on that [[baryons]] are topological [[solitons]], namely [[Skyrmions]]  $[$but$]$ the usual [[Skyrmion]] picture of the [[baryon]] has to be modified significantly in the context of full [[QCD]]. 

> $[...]$ 

> the [[AdS/CFT|holographic picture]] naturally brings a gauge principle in the [[bulk spacetime|bulk]] description of the [[flavor physics|flavor]] dynamics in such a way that all spin one [[mesons]] as well as [[pions]] would enter the $[$ [[Skyrmion|skyrmionic]]-$]$construction of [[baryons]] on the equal footing.

> $[...]$

> [[holographic QCD]] is similar to the [[chiral perturbation theory]] in the sense that we deal with exclusively [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] [[observables|operators]] of the theory. The huge difference is, however, that this new approach tends to treat all [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] objects together. Not only the light [[meson]] [[field (physics)|fields]] like [[pions]] but also heavy [[vector mesons]] and [[baryons]] appear together, at least in principle. In other words, a [[holographic QCD]] deals with all [[color charge|color]]-[[trivial representation|singlets]] simultaneously, giving us a lot more predictive power.

> $[...]$


> The expectation that there exists a more intelligent theory consisting only of [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] objects in the [[large N limit|large Nc limit]] is thus realized via [[string theory]] in a somewhat surprising manner that the master fields, those truly physical degrees of freedom, actually live not in four dimensional Minkowskian world but in five or
higher dimensional curved geometry. This is not however completely unanticipated, and was heralded in the celebrated work by [Eguchi and Kawai in early 1980's](#EguchiKawai82) which is all the more remarkable in retrospect. 

> $[...]$

> To compare against actual [[QCD]], we must fix $[$the [['t Hooft coupling]] and the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification|KK]]-[[scale]]$]$ to fit
both the [[pion]] decay constant $f_\pi$ and the [[mass]] of the first [[vector meson]]. After this fitting, all other infinite number of [[masses]] and [[coupling constants]] are fixed. This version $[$the holographic [[WSS model]]$]$ of the [[holographic QCD]]  is extremely predictive.

> $[...]$

> $[$this$]$ elevates the classic [[skyrmion|Skyrme picture]] based on [[pions]] to a unified model involving all [[vector meson|spin one mesons]] in addition to [[pions]]. This is why the picture is extremely predictive. 

> As we saw in this note, for low momentum processes, such as soft [[pion]] [[scattering amplitude|processes]], soft [[rho meson]] exchanges, and soft elastic scattering of [[photons]], the $[$holographic [[WSS model|WSS]]-$]$model's predictions compare extremely well with experimental data. It is somewhat mysterious that the [[baryon]] sector works out almost as well as the [[meson]] sector

{#FromSNM16} From [Suganuma-Nakagawa-Matsumoto 16, p. 1](#SuganumaNakagawaMatsumoto16):

> Since 1973, [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) has been established as the fundamental theory of the [[strong nuclear force|strong interaction]]. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to solve QCD directly in an analytical manner, and many effective models of QCD have been used instead of QCD, but most models cannot be derived from QCD and its connection to QCD is unclear. 

> To analyze nonperturbative QCD, the [[lattice QCD]] Monte Carlo simulation has been also used as a first-principle calculation of the strong interaction. However, it has several weak points. For example, the [[quantum state|state]] information (e.g. the [[wave function]]) is severely limited, because [[lattice QCD]] is based on the [[path-integral]] formalism. Also, it is difficult to take the [[chiral fermion|chiral]] limit, because zero-mass [[pions]] require [[large volume limit|infinite volume lattices]]. There appears a notorious "[sign problem](lattice+gauge+theory#SignProblem)" at finite density.

> On the other hand, [[holographic QCD]] has a direct connection to [[QCD]], and can be derived from QCD in some limit. In fact, [[holographic QCD]] is equivalent to infrared QCD in [[large N limit|large Nc]] and strong [['t Hooft coupling]] $\lambda$, via [[gauge/gravity correspondence]]. Remarkably, [[holographic QCD]] is successful to reproduce many [[hadron]] [[phenomenology]] such as [[vector meson dominance]], the KSRF relation, hidden local symmetry, the GSW model and the [[skyrmion|Skyrme soliton picture]]. Unlike [[lattice QCD]] simulations, holographic QCD is usually formulated in the chiral limit, and does not have the [sign problem](lattice+gauge+theory#SignProblem) at finite density.

From [Rho et a. 16](#RhoEtAl16):

> One can make $[$[[chiral perturbation theory]]$]$ consistent with [[QCD]] by suitably matching the [[correlators]] of the [[effective field theory|effective theory]] to those of [[QCD]] at a [[scale]] near $\Lambda$. Clearly this procedure is not limited to only one set of [[vector mesons]]; in fact, one can readily generalize it to an infinite number of hidden [[gauge fields]] in an [[effective field theory|effective]] [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]]. In so doing, it turns out that a fifth dimension is "deconstructed" in a (4+1)-dimensional (or 5D) [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] type form. We will see in Part III that such a structure arises, [[top-down model building|top-down]], in [[string theory]].

> $[...]$

> $[$this [[holographic QCD]]$]$ model comes out to describe — unexpectedly well — low-energy properties of both [[mesons]] and [[baryons]], in particular those properties reliably described in quenched [[lattice QCD]] simulations.

> $[...]$

> One of the most noticeable results of this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]] is the first derivation of [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] (VD) that holds both for [[mesons]] and for [[baryons]]. It has been somewhat of an oddity and a puzzle that [[Jun John Sakurai|Sakurai's]] [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] — with the lowest [[vector mesons]] [[rho meson|ρ]] and ω — which held very well for [[pion|pionic]] [[form factors]] at low momentum transfers famously failed for [[nucleon]] [[form factors]]. In this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]], the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] comes out automatically for both the [[pion]] and the [[nucleon]] provided that the infinite $[$[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-]]$]$tower is included. While the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] for the [[pion]] with the infinite tower is not surprising given the successful Sakurai VD, that the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] holds also for the [[nucleons]] is highly nontrivial. $[...]$ It turns out to be a consequence of a [[AdS/QCD|holographic]] [[Cheshire cat principle|Cheshire Cat phenomenon]]

## Models 
 {#Models}

In approaches to $AdS/QCD$ one distinguishes [[top-down model building]] -- where the ambition is to first set up a globally consistent ambient [[intersecting D-brane model]] where a [[Yang-Mills theory]] at least similar to [[QCD]] arises on suitable [[D-branes]] ([[geometric engineering of gauge theories]]) -- from [[bottom-up model building]] approaches which are more cavalier about global consistency and first focus on accurately fitting the intended [[phenomenology]] of [[QCD]] as the [[asymptotic boundary|asymptotic]] [[boundary field theory]] of [[gravity]]+[[gauge theory]] on some [[anti de Sitter spacetime]]. (Eventually both these approaches should meet "in the middle" to produce a [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] which is both [[standard model of particle physics|realistic]] as well as globally consistent as a [[string vacuum]]; see also at _[[string phenomenology]]_.)

### Top-down models
 {#TopDownModels}

#### Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model
  {#WittenSakaiSugimotoModel}

A good [[top-down model building]]-approach to AdS/QCD is due to [Sakai-Sugimoto 04](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05](#SakaiSugimoto05) based on [Witten 98](#Witten98), see [Rebhan 14](#Rebhan14), [Sugimoto 16](#Sugimoto16) for review. 

##### Brane configuration
 {#WSSBraneConfiguration}

The [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] [[geometric engineering of QFT|geometrically engineers]] something at least close to [[QCD]]: on the [[worldvolume]] of [[intersecting D-brane models|coincident]] [[black brane|black]] [[M5-branes]] with [[near horizon geometry]] a [[KK-compactification]] of $AdS_7 \times S^4$ in the decoupling limit where the [[worldvolume]] theory becomes the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal SCFT]]. Here the [[KK-compactification]] is on a [[torus]] with anti-periodic boundary conditions for the [[fermions]] in one direction, thus [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|breaking]] all [[supersymmetry]] ([[Scherk-Schwarz mechanism]]). Here the first circle [[KK-compactification|reduction]] realizes, under [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]], the [[M5-branes]] as [[D4-branes]], hence the model now looks like 5d [[Yang-Mills theory]] further [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on a circle. ([Witten 98, section 4](#Witten98)). 

The further introduction of [[intersecting D-brane model|intersecting]] [[D8-branes]] and [[anti D-brane|anti]] [[D8-branes]] to [[D4-D8 brane bound states]] makes a sensible sector of [[chiral fermions]] appear in this model ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05](#SakaiSugimoto05))

##### Glueballs

##### Hadrons
  {#Hadrons}


In this [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] for [[non-perturbative effect|strongly coupled]] [[QCD]] the [[hadrons]] in [[QCD]] correspond to [[string theory|string-theoretic]]-phenomena in the [[bulk field theory]]:

###### Mesons


The [[mesons]] ([[bound states]] of 2 [[quarks]]) correspond to [[open strings]] in the bulk, whose two endpoints on the [[asymptotic boundary]] correspond to the two quarks

###### Baryons
 {#Baryons}

The [[baryons]] ([[bound states]] of $N_c$ [[quarks]]) appear in two different but equivalent ([Sugimoto 16, 15.4.1](#Sugimoto16)) guises:

1. as [[wrapped brane|wrapped]] [[D4-branes]] with $N_c$ [[open strings]] connecting them to the [[D8-brane]]

   ([Witten 98b](#Witten98b), [Gross-Ooguri 98, Sec. 5](#GrossOoguri98), [BISY 98](#BISY98), [CGS98](#CGS98))

1. as [[skyrmions]] 

   ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04, section 5.2](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05, section 3.3](#SakaiSugimoto05), see [Bartolini 17](#Bartolini17)). 

For review see [Sugimoto 16](#Sugimoto16), [Yi 09](#Yi09), [Yi 11](#Yi11), [Yi 13](#Yi13),  also [Rebhan 14, around (18)](#Rebhan14).

Equivalently, these baryon states are the [[Yang-Mills instantons]] on the [[D8-brane]] giving the [[D4-D8 brane bound state]] ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04, 5.7](#SakaiSugimoto04)) as a special case of the general situation for [[Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states]] (e.g. [Tong 05, 1.4](Dp-D%28p%2B4%29-brane+bound+state#Tong05)).

Moreover, the above 4-brane model for baryons is claimed to be equivalent to the old **[[Skyrmion]] model** (see [Sakai-Sugimoto 04, section 5.2](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05, section 3.3](#SakaiSugimoto05), [Sugimoto 16, 15.4.1](#Sugimoto16), [Bartolini 17](#Bartolini17)). 

But the Skyrmion model of baryons has been shown to apply also to [[bound states]] of [[baryons]], namely the [[atomic nuclei]]  ([Riska 93](Skyrmion#Riska93), [Battye-Manton-Sutcliffe 10](Skyrmion#BattyeMantonSutcliffe10), [Manton 16](Skyrmion#Manton16), [Naya-Sutcliffe 18](Skyrmion#NayaSutcliffe18)), at least for small [[atomic number]].

For instance, various [[experiment|experimentally]] observed resonances of the [[carbon]] [[nucleus]] are modeled well by a Skyrmion with [[atomic number]] 6 and hence baryon number 12 ([Lau-Manton 14](Skyrmion#LauMaonton14)):

More generally, the [[Skyrmion]]-model of [[atomic nuclei]] gives good matches with [[experiment]] if not just the [[pi meson]] but also the [[rho meson]]-background is included ([Naya-Sutcliffe 18](Skyrmion#NayaSutcliffe18)):

#### WSS-type model for 2d QCD
 {#WSSTypeModelFor2dQCD}

There is a direct analogue for [[2d QCD]] of the [above](#WittenSakaiSugimotoModel) [[WSS model]] for 4d [[QCD]]
([Gao-Xu-Zeng 06](#GaoXuZeng06), [Yee-Zahed 11](#YeeZahed11)). 

The corresponding [[intersecting D-brane model]] is much as that for 4d QCD [above](#WSSBraneConfiguration), just with 

1. [[colour charge|color]] [[D2-branes]] instead of [[D4-branes]];

1. [[baryon]]$\,$ [[D6-branes]] instead of [[D4-branes]];

1. [[meson]]$\,$ [[field (physics)|fields]] given by  3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] instead of [[5d Chern-Simons theory]]:

#### Type0B/$YM_4$-correspondence
 {#Type0StringCorrespondence}

Instead of starting with [[M5-branes]] in [[supergravity|locally supersymmetric]] [[M-theory]] and then [[spontaneously broken symmetry|spontaneously breaking]] all [[supersymmetry]] by suitable [[KK-compactification]] as in the [Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model](#WittenSakaiSugimotoModel), one may start with a non-supersymmetric [[bulk field theory|bulk]] [[string theory]] in the first place. 

In this vein, it has been argued in [GLMR 00](#GLMR00) that there is holographic duality between [[type 0 string theory]] and non-supersymmetric 4d [[Yang-Mills theory]] (hence potentially something close to [[QCD]]). See also [AAS 19](#AAS19).


### Bottom-up models
  {#BottomUpModels}

A popular [[bottom-up model building|bottom-up approach]] of AdS/QCD is known as the _hard-wall model_ ([Erlich-Katz-Son-Stephanov 05](#ErlichKatzSonStephanov05)).

Further refinement to the "soft-wall model" is due to [KKSS 06](#KKSS06) and further to "improved holographic QCD" is due to [Gursoy-Kiritsis-Nitti 07](#GursoyKiritsisNitti07), [Gursoy-Kiritsis 08](#GursoyKiritsis08), see [GKMMN 10](#GKMMN10).


## Comparison with experiment

Comparison with [[experiment]] (mostly using bottom-up models).
 
Computations due to [Katz-Lewandowski-Schwartz 05](#KatzLewandowskiSchwartz05) using the hard-wall model ([Erlich-Katz-Son-Stephanov 05](#ErlichKatzSonStephanov05)) find the following comparison of AdS/QCD predictions to [[QCD]]-[[experiment]]

These computations shown so far all use just the field theory in the bulk, not yet the stringy modes ([[limit of a sequence|limit]] of vanishing [[string length]] $\sqrt{\alpha'} \to 0$). Incorporating bulk string corrections further improves these results, see [Sonnenschein-Weissman 18](#SonnenscheinWeissman18). 

## Embedding into the standard model of particle physics


[Nastase 03, p. 2](#Nastase03):

> An obvious question then is can one lift this [[intersecting D-brane model|D brane construction]] for the [[holographic QCD|holographic dual of QCD]] to a [[standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] embedding?  I study this question in the context of [[intersecting D-brane models|D-brane-world]] [[GUT]] models and find that one needs to have [[TeV-scale string theory]].

> Understanding the nucleon structure is one of the most
important research topics in fundamental science, and tremendous efforts have been done to deepen our knowledge over several decades. $[...]$ Since $[these]$ are highly nonperturbative physical quantities, in principle they are not calculable by the direct use of QCD. Furthermore, although there is available data, this has large errors. These facts cause the huge uncertainties which can be seen in the preceding studies based on the global QCD analysis.

> In this work, we investigate the gluon distribution in nuclei by calculating the structure functions in the framework of holographic QCD, which is constructed based on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
