## Idea

The definition of _cohesive topos_ or _category of cohesion_ aims to axiomatize properties of a [[topos]] that make it a [[gros topos]] of [[space]]s inside of which [[geometry]] may take place.

###### Definition

A [[topos]] $E$ over a topos $S$, i.e. equipped with a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}
$$

is **cohesive** or  **a topos of cohesion** if it has the following [[stuff, structure, property|properties]]:

1. it is a [[locally connected topos]]: there exists a

## Examples

* the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is a cohesive topos.

* the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $(\infty,1)Sh(CartSp) = $ [[?LieGrpd]] on [[CartSp]] is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
