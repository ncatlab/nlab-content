## Idea 

The notion of a $\lambda$-[[lambda ring|ring]] $R$ is closely tied to classical [[Adams operations]] $\psi^n \colon R \to R$, modeled by [[monoid]] [[homomorphisms]] from the multiplicative monoid $(\mathbb{N}_+, \cdot)$ to the monoid of [[ring homomorphisms]] on the [[underlying]] [[commutative ring]] $R$ and their compositions. As $\mathbb{N}_+$ is freely generated by primes $p$, the Adams operations $\psi^p$ play a distinguished role. Classically, they are "[[Frobenius lifts]]", i.e., $\psi^p(x)$ agrees with $x^p$ modulo $p$: the Frobenius map $x \mapsto x^p$ which defines a ring endomorphism on $R/p R$ lifts to the homomorphism $\psi^p\colon R \to R$. 

The notion of $\delta$-ring, originally due to [[André Joyal]] and developed independently by [[Alexandru Buium]] and others, axiomatizes the formal properties that hold for the "[[arithmetic derivative]]" 

$$\delta(x) = \frac{\psi^p(x) - x^p}{p}.$$ 

## Definition 

Fix a prime number $p$ and a power $q = p^r$ ($r \geq 0$). 

\begin{definition} A $\delta$-ring is a commutative ring equipped with a unary operation $\delta: A \to A$ satisfying the following identities: 

1. $\delta(x+y) = \delta(y) + \delta(y) - \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \frac1{p}\binom{q}{i} x^i y^{q-i}$; 

1. $\delta(x y) = x^q\delta(y) + \delta(x)y^q + p\delta(x)\delta(y)$, $\delta(1) = 0$. 

We say that $A$ is a $\delta$-ring with respect to the pair $(p, q)$. 
\end{definition} 

These conditions imply that the unary operation $f(x) = x^q + p\delta(x)$ is an endomorphism of the ring $A$: 

$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y); $$ 

$$f(x y) = f(x)f(y)$$ 

$$f(1) = 1$$ 
We say that $f$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with $\delta$. 

Conversely, let $f$ be an endomorphism of a commutative ring $A$ without $p$-torsion. Suppose that for all $x \in A$ 

$$f(x) \equiv x^q \mod p A.$$ 
We obtain a structure of $\delta$-ring on $A$ defined as follows: 

$$\delta(x) = \frac1{p}(f(x) - x^q).$$
