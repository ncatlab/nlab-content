## General

The following definition was introduced by [[Jeff Smith]] under the name of a _minimal model structure_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

(See Definition&#160;2.1 in ([RT 2003](#RT)).
A [[model structure]] on a category&#160;$M$ with a fixed class of [[cofibrations]]&#160;$C$ is _left-determined_ if its class of [[weak equivalences]] is the smallest class of morphisms
that is closed under [[retracts]], satisfies the [[2-out-of-3 property]], contains all morphisms with a [[right lifting property]] with respect to&#160;$C$, and whose intersection with&#160;$C$ is [[weakly saturated]].

=--

Note that a left-determined model structure
is determined uniquely by its class of cofibrations.

Assuming the [[VopÄ›nka principle]], the existence
of left-determined model structures can be shown
under very general conditions, see Theorem&#160;2.2 in ([RT 2003](#RT)):

###### Theorem

The weak saturation of any [[set]] of morphisms in a [[locally presentable category]] is the class of cofibrations of a (unique) left-determined model structure.

Without the Vop&#283;nka principle the best results known so far require additional restrictions on the underlying category:

###### Theorem 

([Olschok 2009](#Olschok09)) The weak saturation of a [[set]]&#160;$I$ of morphisms in a [[locally presentable category]] is the class of cofibrations of a (unique) left-determined model structure as long as the [[weak factorization system]] generated by&#160;$I$ admits a very good cartesian cylinder (Definition&#160;2.3 in ([Gaucher 2015](#G))) and all objects are cofibrant.
