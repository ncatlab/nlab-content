## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], an [[associative algebra]] over $R$ is a [[ring]] $A$ equipped with a ring inclusion $R \hookrightarrow A$. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

If the $R$-algebra $A$ is equipped with an $R$-algebra homomorphism the other way round, 

$$
  \epsilon \colon A \to R
$$

then it is called an _augmented algebra_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In [Cartan-Eilenberg](#CartanEilenberg) this is called a _supplemented algebra_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[kernel]] of $\epsilon$ is called the corresponding [[augmentation ideal]] in $A$.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

An augmentation of a bare [[ring]] itself, being an [[associative algebra]] over the ring of [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$, is a ring homomorphism to the integers

$$
  \epsilon \colon R \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

###### Example

Every [[group algebra]] $R[G]$ is canonically augmented, the augmentation map being the operation that forms the sum of [[coefficients]] of the canonical basis elements.

###### Example

If $X$ is a variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $x\in X(k)$ is a closed point, then the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ naturally has the structure of an augmented $k$-algebra. The augmentation map $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}\rightarrow k$ is the evaluation map, and the augmentation ideal is the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$.
