## Idea

Under the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]] a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is identified with the [[formal dual]] of its $\mathbb{R}$-[[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]]. Given then a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded module]] $\mathfrak{a}$ over $C^\infty(X)$ concentrated away from zero, the [[symmetric algebra|graded symmetric]] [[graded algebra]]

$$
  Sym_{C^\infty(X)}\left(
    \mathfrak{a}
  \right)
$$

may naturally be thought of as the [[formal dual]] of a _$\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold_.

If moreover $Sym_{C^\infty(X)}\left(\mathfrak{a}\right)$ is equipped with a [[differential]] that makes it a [[differential graded-commutative algebra]], then the formal dual is called a _[[differential graded manifold]]_.
