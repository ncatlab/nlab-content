# Idea

A *direct category* is a [[category]] in which the morphisms only go in "one direction."

# Definition

A category $D$ is a **direct category** if there exists a function $d\colon ob(D)\to \alpha$, for some [[ordinal]] $\alpha$, such that every nonidentity morphism of $D$ raises degree.  If $D$ is [[finite category|finite]], this is equivalent to saying that $D$ admits no nontrivial cycles of morphisms.  If $D^{op}$ is a direct category, then we say that $D$ is an **inverse category**.

Every direct category (and every inverse category) is in particular a [[Reedy category]], and therefore whenever $M$ is a [[model category]] there is a [[Reedy model structure]] on $M^D$.  In the case of direct and inverse categories, these model structures are even easier to describe, since either the latching or the matching objects are degenerate.
