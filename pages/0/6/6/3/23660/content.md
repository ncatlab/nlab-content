## Idea ##

A construction ([UFP13, Sec. 11.3](#UFP13)) of the [[type]] of [[real numbers]] in [[homotopy type theory]] as a [[higher inductive-inductive type]].

As opposed to the "naive" [[quotient type]] of [[regular Cauchy sequences]] of [[rational numbers]] (i.e. the quotient type of the [[setoid]]/[[Bishop set]] by which the [[Cauchy real numbers]] are traditionally modeled in [[constructive analysis]]) this [[higher inductive-inductive type]] is [[sequentially complete]].

Notice that this crucial property of the [[real number]] fails for other constructions:

* The [[Cauchy real numbers]], defined as the [[quotient type]] of [[regular Cauchy sequences]] of [[rational numbers]], is [[sequentially complete]] only assuming that any sequence of its [[terms]] has a [[lift]] to a sequence of representing [[regular Cauchy sequences]], which requires an extra [[axiom of countable choice]] (and is the reason why traditional [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]]-[[constructive analysis]] does not pass to the quotient but stays with the [[setoid]]/[[Bishop set]]).

## Definition ##

### As a sequentially complete Archimedean ordered field ###

Let $K$ be an [[Archimedean ordered field]]. $K$ is *[[sequentially complete]]* if every [[regular Cauchy sequence]] in $K$ [[converges]]. The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of sequentially complete Archimedean fields. 

More abstractly, let $\mathrm{ArchiFields}$ be the [[category]] of [[Archimedean ordered fields]] and Archimedean ordered field homomorphisms, and let $F:\mathrm{ArchiFields} \to \mathrm{ArchiFields}$ be the [[endofunction]] which takes an Archimedean ordered field $K$ to the Archimedean ordered field $F(K)$ which is the [[quotient set]] of the set of [[regular Cauchy sequences]] in $K$. $K$ is [[sequentially complete]] if there is an isomorphism $K \cong F(K)$, and the **HoTT book real numbers** $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the initial Archimedean ordered field with an isomorphism $\mathbb{R}_H \cong F(\mathbb{R}_H)$. 

### As a Cauchy structure ###

The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the initial object in the category of [[Cauchy structures]] and [[Cauchy structure homomorphisms]]. 

### As a higher inductive-inductive type ###

As a [[higher inductive-inductive type]]:

Let $\mathbb{Q}$ be the [[rational numbers]] and let 

$$\mathbb{Q}_{+} \coloneqq \sum_{x:\mathbb{Q}} 0 \lt x$$

be the [[positive number|positive]] rational numbers. The __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ are inductively generated by the following:

* a function $inj: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_H$

* a function $lim: C(\mathbb{R}_H) \to \mathbb{R}_H$, where $C(\mathbb{R}_H)$ is the type of [[rational Cauchy approximation]]s in $\mathbb{R}_H$.  

* a dependent family of terms

$$a:\mathbb{R}_H, b:\mathbb{R}_H \vdash eq_{\mathbb{R}_H}(a, b): \left( \prod_{\epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}} (a \sim_{\epsilon} b) \right) \to (a =_{\mathbb{R}_H} b)$$

and the [[premetric]] type family $\sim$ is simultaneously inductively generated by the following:

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{Q}, b:\mathbb{Q}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Q}}(a, b, \epsilon): (\vert a - b \vert \lt \epsilon) \to (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon} inj(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{Q}, b:C(\mathbb{R}_H), \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \eta:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{\mathbb{Q}, C(\mathbb{R}_H)}(a, b, \epsilon, \eta): (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon} b_{\eta}) \to (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon + \eta} lim(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:C(\mathbb{R}_H), b:\mathbb{Q}, \delta:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{C(\mathbb{R}_H), \mathbb{Q}}(a, b, \delta, \epsilon): (a_{\delta} \sim_{\epsilon} inj(b) ) \to (lim(a) \sim_{\delta + \epsilon} inj(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:C(\mathbb{R}_H), b:C(\mathbb{R}_H), \delta:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \eta:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{C(\mathbb{R}_H), C(\mathbb{R}_H)}(a, b, \delta, \epsilon, \eta): (a_{\delta} \sim_{\epsilon} b_{\eta} ) \to (lim(a) \sim_{\delta + \epsilon + \eta} lim(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{R}_H, b:\mathbb{R}_H, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \pi(a, b, \epsilon): isProp(a \sim_{\epsilon} b)$$

## Properties 

The [[analytic functions]], such as the [[exponential function]], the [[sine function]], and the [[cosine function]] are well defined in the HoTT book real numbers, since all regular Cauchy sequences converge in the HoTT book real numbers.
