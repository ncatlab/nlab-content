## Idea ##

A construction ([UFP13, Sec. 11.3](#UFP13)) of the [[type]] of [[real numbers]] in [[homotopy type theory]] as a [[higher inductive-inductive type]].

As opposed to the "naive" [[quotient type]] of [[regular sequence|regular]] [[Cauchy sequences]] of [[rational numbers]] (i.e. the quotient type of the [[setoid]]/[[Bishop set]] by which the [[Cauchy real numbers]] are traditionally modeled in [[constructive analysis]]) this [[higher inductive-inductive type]] is [[sequentially modulated Cauchy complete]].

Notice that this crucial property of the [[real number]] fails for other constructions:

* The [[quotient type]] of [[regular sequence|regular]] [[Cauchy sequences]] of [[rational numbers]] is Cauchy complete only assuming that any sequence of its [[terms]] has a [[lift]] to a sequence of representing [[Cauchy sequences]], which requires an extra [[axiom of countable choice]] (and is the reason why traditional [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]]-[[constructive analysis]] does not pass to the quotient but stays with the [[setoid]]/[[Bishop set]]).

* The [[modulated Cauchy real numbers]] are not sequentially modulated Cauchy complete either, in [[constructive mathematics]].

## Definition ##

### As a sequentially modulated Cauchy complete Archimedean field ###

Let $F$ be an [[Archimedean field]]. $F$ is *[[sequentially modulated Cauchy complete]]* if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $F$ with a [[modulus of convergence]] [[converges]]. The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of sequentially modulated Cauchy complete Archimedean fields. 

### As a Cauchy structure ###

The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the initial object in the category of [[Cauchy structures]] and [[Cauchy structure homomorphisms]]. 

### As a higher inductive-inductive type ###

As a [[higher inductive-inductive type]]:

Let $\mathbb{Q}$ be the [[rational numbers]] and let 

$$\mathbb{Q}_{+} \coloneqq \sum_{x:\mathbb{Q}} 0 \lt x$$

be the [[positive number|positive]] rational numbers. The __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ are inductively generated by the following:

* a function $inj: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_H$

* a function $lim: C(\mathbb{R}_H) \to \mathbb{R}_H$, where $C(\mathbb{R}_H)$ is the type of [[Cauchy approximation]]s in $\mathbb{R}_H$.  

* a dependent family of terms

$$a:\mathbb{R}_H, b:\mathbb{R}_H \vdash eq_{\mathbb{R}_H}(a, b): \left( \prod_{\epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}} (a \sim_{\epsilon} b) \right) \to (a =_{\mathbb{R}_H} b)$$

and the [[premetric]] type family $\sim$ is simultaneously inductively generated by the following:

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{Q}, b:\mathbb{Q}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Q}}(a, b, \epsilon): (\vert a - b \vert \lt \epsilon) \to (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon} inj(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{Q}, b:C(\mathbb{R}_H), \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \eta:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{\mathbb{Q}, C(\mathbb{R}_H)}(a, b, \epsilon, \eta): (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon} b_{\eta}) \to (inj(a) \sim_{\epsilon + \eta} lim(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:C(\mathbb{R}_H), b:\mathbb{Q}, \delta:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{C(\mathbb{R}_H), \mathbb{Q}}(a, b, \delta, \epsilon): (a_{\delta} \sim_{\epsilon} inj(b) ) \to (lim(a) \sim_{\delta + \epsilon} inj(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:C(\mathbb{R}_H), b:C(\mathbb{R}_H), \delta:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \eta:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \mu_{C(\mathbb{R}_H), C(\mathbb{R}_H)}(a, b, \delta, \epsilon, \eta): (a_{\delta} \sim_{\epsilon} b_{\eta} ) \to (lim(a) \sim_{\delta + \epsilon + \eta} lim(b))$$

* a dependent family of terms
$$a:\mathbb{Q}, b:\mathbb{Q}, \epsilon:\mathbb{Q}_{+} \vdash \pi(a, b, \epsilon): isProp(a \sim_{\epsilon} b)$$

## Properties 

The [[analytic functions]], such as the [[exponential function]], the [[sine function]], and the [[cosine function]] are well defined in the HoTT book real numbers, since all modulated Cauchy sequences converge in the HoTT book real numbers.
