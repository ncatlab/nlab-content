## Idea

In [[solid state physics]], by a *quantum material* one means -- broadly and somewhat vaguely -- a [[phase of matter]] whose properties are deeply controlled by [[quantum physics]] and often by [[topological physics -- contents|topology]], for instance in that their [[quantum state|quantum]] [[ground state]] exhibits [[long-range entanglement]]. Prime examples are [[superconductors]] and, more recently and more prominently, [[topological phases of matter]] possibly controlled by [[topological order]], such as [[topological insulators]]; also [[quasicrystals]]. A concrete example is [[graphene]].
