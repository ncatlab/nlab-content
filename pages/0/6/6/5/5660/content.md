## Idea

_$E$-Theory_ is the name of a [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[C*-algebras]] and whose [[hom-sets]] are homotopy classes of slightly generalized $C*$-homomorphisms, called _[[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]]_. These hom-sets have the structure of an [[abelian group]] and are also called the _E-groups_ of their arguments.

This construction may be understood as the universal improvement of [[KK-theory]] under [[excision]] ([Higson 90](#Higson90)). Accordingly, the $E$-groups behave like groups of a [[K-theory]]-like [[generalized cohomology theory]].

In terms of [[noncommutative topology]] (regarding, in view of [[Gelfand duality]], noncommutative [[C*-algebras]] as [[algebras of functions]] on "noncommutative topological spaces") one may understand this as dealing with "locally badly behaved space" such as certain [[quotients]] of [[foliations]] ([Connes-Higson 90](ConnesHigson90))
in a way that resembles a noncommutative version of [[shape theory]] ([D&#257;d&#257;rlat 94](#Dadarlat94)).

## Properties

### Relation to KK-theory
 {#RelationToKKTheory}

There is a universal [[functor]] $KK \to E$ from the [[KK-theory]] [[homotopy category]] to that of $E$-theory. Restricted to [[nuclear C*-algebras]] this is a [[full and faithful functor]]. ([Higson 90](#Higson90)) (...)

If in the definition of E-theory by [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]] one restricts to those which take values in contractive [[completely positive maps]], then the results is isomorphic to KK-theory again. (K. Thomsen, [Introduction, p. 34](#Introduction)). The above universal functor $KK \to E$ is then just the corresponding [[forgetful functor]].

It follows that the Kasparov product in [[KK-theory]] is equivalently given by the composition of the corresponding completely positive [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]].
