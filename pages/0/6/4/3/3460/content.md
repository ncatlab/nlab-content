Let $K$ be a [[field]]; all $K$-[[associative algebra|algebras]] will be assumed [[unital algebra|unital]]. A [[commutative algebra|commutative]] $K$-algebra $A$ is __separable__ if it is [[projective object|projective]] as a $K$-[[module]] and also projective as $A\otimes_K A$-module.

A finite-dimensional commutative $K$-algebra $A$ is separable iff it is a finite product of [[separable field extension]]s of $K$. Equivalently it is projective as $A\otimes_K A$-module. Every separable $K$-algebra is a [[filtered colimit]] of finite-dimensional separable $K$-algebras. 

Separable algebras play a major role in the [[Galois theory]] of extensions of algebras. The [[etale morphism|étale cover]] in [[algebraic geometry]] is sort of combination of [[covering space]] and separable algebra business.

There are further generalizations, leading to [[separable functor]]s ...
