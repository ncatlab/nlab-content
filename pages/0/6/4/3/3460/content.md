Let $K$ be a [[field]]; all $K$-algebras will be assumed unital. A commutative $K$-algebra $A$ is __separable__ if it is [[projective object|projective]] as a $K$-module and also projective as $A\otimes_K A$-module.

A finite dimensional commutative $K$-algebra $A$ is separable iff it is a finite product of [[separable field extension]]s of $K$. Equivalently it is projective as $A\otimes_K A$-module. Every separable $K$-algebra is a filtered colimit of finite dimensional separable $K$-algebras. 

Separable algebras play a major role in the Galois theory for extensions of algebras. The [[etale morphism|etale cover]] in [[algebraic geometry]] is sort of combination of [[covering spaces]] and separable algebra business.

There are further generalizations, leading to separable functors...
