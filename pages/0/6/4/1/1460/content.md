A _differential graded category_ is a category enriched
over complexes of modules for some commutative ring $k$.
Given a differential graded category $D$, one can form
a $k$-linear category $H^{0}(D)$ with the same objects as $D$
but with morphisms between two objects $X$ and $Y$ defined to be the $0$th cohomology group of the complex of morphisms
between $X$ and $Y$ in $D$.

The derived category of an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$
having enough injectives (or projectives) can be constructed
as $H^{0}$ of the differential graded category consisting
of complexes of injective (or projective) objects in $\mathcal{A}$ with morphisms between two complex $X$ and $Y$ being the Hom-complex from $X$ to $Y$. One can check that
$H^{0}$ of the Hom-complex between $X$ and $Y$ is precisely
homotopy classes of chain maps from $X$ to $Y$.
