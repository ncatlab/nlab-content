Robert (Bob) W. Thomason (5 Nov 1952-Nov 1995) was an American mathematician. Towards the end of his short life, he worked in [[Max Karoubi]]'s lab. at Paris VII.  His main contributions were in [[homotopy theory]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic K-theory]], where he carefully used advanced categorical methods.
