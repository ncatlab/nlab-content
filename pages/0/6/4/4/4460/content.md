## Definition

A __diamond__ is a finite [[directed graph]] without oriented cycles which is a union of two (directed) chains with common minimum and common maximum (some other intermediate points and even edges may be in common as well). 


## Completing spans to diamonds

It is often interesting wheather a given [[span]] in some partial ordered set can be completed into a diamond. The property of a collection of spans to consist of spans which are expandable into diamonds is very useful in the theory of [[rewriting]] systems and producing normal forms in algebra. There are classical results e.g. Newman's diamond lemma, &#352;ir&#353;ov-Bergman's diamond lemma (&#352;ir&#353;ov is also sometimes spelled as Shirshov), and Church-Rosser theorem (and the corresponding Church-Rosser confluence property).

## Other notion of a diamond

Distinguish from the 5-edge 4-point [undirected diamond graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_graph).
