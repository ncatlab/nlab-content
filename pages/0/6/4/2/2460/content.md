## Idea

The notion _universal localization_ or _Cohn localization_ of a [[ring]] is a variant of the notion of [[localization of a ring]] which forces not just elements of the ring to become invertible (which one may think of as $1 \times 1$-[[matrices]]) but forces more general [[matrices]] with [[coefficients]] in the ring to become invertible.

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[multiplicative set]] of [[matrices]] over a (typically noncommutative) [[ring]] $R$. 

We say that a [[homomorphism]] of rings $f: R\to S$ is _$\Sigma$-inverting_ if all matrices $f(A)$ over $S$ where $A\in \Sigma$ 
are invertible in $S$.
The Cohn localization of a ring $R$, is a homomorphism of rings $R\to \Sigma^{-1} R$ which is initial in the category of all $\Sigma$-inverting maps (which is the subcategory of coslice category $R/Ring$).

## More general definition 

Given a [[ring]] $R$ and a family $S$ of morphisms in the [[category]] $R$[[Mod]] of (say left) [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module|projective]] $R$-[[modules]], we say that a morphism of rings $f:R\to T$ is **$S$-inverting** if the [[extension of scalars]] from $R$ to $T$ along $f$

$$
  T \otimes_R (-) \colon R Mod \to T Mod
$$

sends all morphisms of $S$ into [[isomorphism]] in the category of left $T$-modules. 

P. M. Cohn has shown that there is a universal object $R\to Q_S R$ in the category of $S$-inverting morphisms. The ring $Q_S R$ (and more precisely the universal morphism itself) are called the **universal localization** or **Cohn localization** of the ring $R$ at $S$.   


## Properties


Cohn localization induces a hereditary torsion theory, i.e. a localization endofunctor on the category of all modules, but it lacks good flatness properties at the level of full module category. However when restricted to the subcategory of finite-dimensional projectives it has all good properties -- it is not any worse than [[Ore localization]]. 

Universal localization is much used in algebraic K-theory, algebraic L-theory and surgery theory -- see [[Andrew Ranicki]]'s slides in the references at Cohn localization and his papers, specially the series with Amnon Neeman.
