A __pseudocompact ring__ is a complete Hausdorff
topological ring $R$ which admits a base at $0$ of two-sided open ideals $I$ for each of which $R/I$ is an Artinian ring. Equivalently, it is a regular [[pro-object]] in Artinian rings. 

Grothendieck developed the theory of [[formal group]]s over pseudocompact rings.
