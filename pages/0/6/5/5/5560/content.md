## Definition

A __pseudocompact ring__ is a [[complete space|complete]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological ring]], $R$, which admits a [[topological base|base]] at $0$ of two-sided [[open subset|open]] [[ideals]] $I$ for each of which the [[quotient ring]] $R/I$ is [[Artinian ring|Artinian]]. Equivalently, it is a *regular* [[pro-object]] in the category of Artinian rings.

(For the definition of **regular** [[pro-object]], see the definition on page 327 of [KG71](#KG71).)

More generally let $R$ be a commutative pseudocompact ring. A complete Hausdorff topological ring $\Lambda$ will be called a __pseudocompact algebra__ over $R$ if

(i)  $\Lambda$ is an $R$ algebra in the usual sense, and 

(ii) $\Lambda$ admits a system of open neighbourhoods of 0 consisting of two-sided ideals $I$ such that $\Lambda/I$ has finite length as an $R$ module.


## Motivations and applications


1. Grothendieck developed the theory of [[formal groups]] over pseudocompact rings. 

1. The completed [[group algebras]] of [[profinite groups]] are naturally pseudocompact algebras, usually considered over [[finite fields]] or the [[profinite completion]] of the [[ring of integers]].
