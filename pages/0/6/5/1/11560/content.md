## Idea

**Spectral algebraic geometry** is the theory of [[homotopical algebraic geometry]] specialized to the [[(infinity,1)-category of spectra]].
Hence it is a generalization of ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] where instead of [[commutative rings]], [[spectral schemes]] are locally modelled on [[commutative ring spectra]].

## Applications

### Elliptic cohomology

Historically, the first application of spectral algebraic geometry was in the study of [[elliptic cohomology]] and [[topological modular forms]].  In particular it allowed the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]] as a certain [[derived moduli stack]] of [[derived elliptic curves]]. This construction is based on the [[Artin-Lurie representability theorem]].  See
