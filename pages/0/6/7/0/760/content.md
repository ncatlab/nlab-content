# Definition #

A **split monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $m:A\to B$ which has a [[retraction]], meaning a morphism $r:B\to A$ such that $r \circ m = 1_A$.

In such a situation one also says that $A$ is a [[retract]] of $B$, and that $A$ is a splitting of the [[idempotent]] $m \circ r:A \to A$.

# Remarks #

* Any split monomorphism is automatically a [[regular monomorphism]] (it is the [[equalizer]] of $m\circ r$ and $1_B$), and therefore also a [[strong monomorphism]], an [[extremal monomorphism]], and (of course) a [[monomorphism]].
