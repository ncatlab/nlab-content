This entry (apart from a few remarks) will be mainly about general statistics and mathematical statistics. For more about physical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and probabilistic interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], see there. There is also a technical notion of [[statistic]] (singular). 


## Idea

Statistics studies the [[analysis]] of collections of 
random or sample data, and the probabilistic 
likelihood of various inferences
on the basis of these data, as well as the mathematical regularities in large [[ensemble]]s of occurrences of such data.

In physics, statistics also pertains to the behaviour of 
large ensembles of particles. For identical particles, 
this is the subject of [[particle statistics]] and for
general systems the subject of [[statistical mechanics]].

Mathematical statistics is based on [[probability theory]]. 
Most of the standard formalism uses [[measure theory]] as used in probability. Statistical mechanics in addition heavily uses [[ergodic theory]]. 


## Definitions

A __statistical model__ is a [[measurable function]] $P : \Theta \to \Delta(X)$, where $X$ and $\Theta$ are [[measurable spaces]] and $\Delta(X)$ is the [[simplex]] of [[probability measures]] over $X$.
