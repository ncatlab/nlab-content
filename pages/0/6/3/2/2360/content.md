A _formal spectrum_ is something that differs from an [[affine scheme]] by an [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] neighbourhood.

#Definition#

For $R$ a [[ring]] and for $I \subset R$
 a specified [[ideal]], the **formal spectrum** of $(R,I)$ -- denoted $\mathrm{Spf} R$  a -- is the locally [[ringed space]] whose underlying [[topological space]] is that of the ordinary [[affine scheme]]
$\mathrm{Spec} (R/I)$ and whose [[structure sheaf]] $O_{Spf R}$ has global sections given by the [[limit]] 

$$
  O_{\mathrm{Spf} R}(\mathrm{Spf} R) :=\lim_n R/(I^n)
  \,.
$$

The formal spectrum is a [[formal scheme]].
