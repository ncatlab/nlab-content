## Selected writings

Introducing [[conformal field theory]]:

* [[Alexander Belavin]], [[Alexander Polyakov]], [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]], _Infinite conformal symmetry in twoâ€“dimensional quantum field theory_, Nuclear Physics B Volume 241, Issue 2, 23 July 1984, Pages 333-380 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(84)90052-X">doi:10.1016/0550-3213(84)90052-X</a>)

On the [[holographic principle]] ([[AdS-CFT correspondence]]) with motivation from and focus on understanding [[flux tubes]] in [[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]], hence on what came to be known as the [[AdS-QCD correspondence]]:

* [[Alexander Polyakov]], *The wall of the cave*, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A **14** (1999) 645-658 &lbrack;[arXiv:hep-th/9809057](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9809057), [doi:10.1142/S0217751X99000324](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X99000324)&rbrack;


and specifically between [[single trace operators]] and [[superstring]]-excitations:

* {#Polyakov02} [[Alexander Polyakov]], _Gauge Fields and Space-Time_, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A17S1 (2002) 119-136 ([arXiv:hep-th/0110196](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110196)):

> The picture which slowly arises from the above considerations is that of the space-time gradually disappearing in the regions of large curvature. The natural description in this case is provided by a gauge theory in which the basic objects are the texts formed from the gauge-invariant words. The theory provides us with the expectation values assigned to the various texts, words and sentences.


> These expectation values can be calculated either from the gauge theory or from the strongly coupled 2d sigma model. The coupling in this model is proportional to the target space curvature. This target space can be interpreted as a usual continuous space-time only when the curvature is small. As we increase the coupling, this interpretation becomes more and more fuzzy and finally completely meaningless.
