## Idea

Set truncation is an operation in [[type theory]] which turns a [[type]] into an [[h-set]]. 

## Definition

### With propositional truncations and quotient sets

Suppose that the [[dependent type theory]] has [[propositional truncations]] and [[quotient sets]]. Then given a type $T$, the [[type family]] $R(x, y)$ indexed by $x:T$ and $y:T$ defined by the [[propositional truncation]] of the [[identity type]] of $T$, $R(x, y) \equiv [\mathrm{Id}_T(x, y)]_{-1}$ is an [[equivalence relation]]. The **set truncation** of $T$ is the quotient set of $T$ by $R$: $[T]_0 \equiv T / R$. 

### With localizations and the circle type

Suppose that [[dependent type theory]] has [[localization of a type|localizations of types]] and the [[circle type]] $S^1$. Then the **set truncation** of a type $T$ is the localization of $T$ at $S^1$: $[T]_0 \equiv L_{S^1}(T)$

### As a higher inductive type

to be done; for the time being see section 6.9 of the [[HoTT Book]].
