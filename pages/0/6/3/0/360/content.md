## Definition

A **graded algebra** is a monoid [[internalization|internal to]] the [[category]] of [[graded vector space|graded vector spaces]].

## Refinements

A [[differential graded algebra]] is a graded algebra $A$ equipped with a [[derivation]] $d : A\to A$ of degree +1 (or -1, dependig on conventions) and such that $d \circ d = 0$. This is the same as a monoid in the category of [[chain complex]]es.
