## Idea

A _symmetric space_ is a specially nice [[homogeneous space]], characterized by the property that for each [[point]] there is a symmetry fixing that point and acting as $-1$ on its [[tangent space]].  An example would be the [[sphere]], the [[Euclidean plane]], or the [[hyperbolic plane]].


## Definitions

A **symmetric space** is classically defined to be a [[quotient]] [[manifold]] of the form $G/H$, where $G$ is a [[Lie group]] and the [[subgroup]] $H$ is the set of fixed points of some [[involution]] $\sigma : G \to G$, that is, a smooth [[homomorphism]] with $\sigma^2 = 1_G$.   Using the involution, every point $a \in G/H$ gives rise to a [[smooth function]]

$$   a \triangleright -  : G/H \to G/H $$

fixing the point $a$ and acting as $-1$ on the tangent space of $a$.  This operations satisfies the laws of an involutory [[quandle]].

More precisely, a **symmetric pair** is a pair $(G,H)$ where $G$ is a [[Lie group]] and the subgroup $H$ is the set of fixed points of some [[involution]] $\sigma : G \to G$.  Different pairs $(G,H)$, $(G',H')$ can give what is normally considered the same symmetric space $G/H \cong G'/H'$.   In other words, not every morphism of symmetric spaces arises from a morphism of symmetric pairs.

To avoid this problem, we can define a symmetric space as a smooth manifold $M$ with a smooth map $\triangleright : M\times M\to M$ such that for all $x,y,z\in M$ 

1. $x \triangleright x = x$ (idempotence)
2. $x \triangleright (x\triangleright y) = y$ 
3. $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y)\triangleright (x \triangleright z)$ ([[left self-distributivity]])
4. for every $x$ there is a neighborhood $U\subset M$ such that $x \triangleright y = y$ implies $x = y$ for all $z\in U$.

This amounts to an involutory [[quandle]] object $Q$ in the category of smooth manifolds, with the property that each point $a \in Q$ is an _isolated_ fixed point of the map $a \triangleright - : Q \to Q$.
