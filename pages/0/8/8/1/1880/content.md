## Definitions

A [[category]] $C$ is __locally cartesian__ if each of its [[slice categories]] $C/x$ is a [[cartesian monoidal category]], meaning that $C/x$ has all finite [[products]].  Another way to say this is that $C$ has all finite [[fibred products]] or equivalently that $C$ has all [[pullbacks]].

A __[[finitely complete category]]__ is precisely a locally cartesian category that has a [[terminal object]].
