## Overview

I suspect that the easiest way to prove uniqueness will be to use the [[initial object]] lemma: if $I$ is an object of a category $D$ equipped with a natural transformation $\iota$ from the [[constant functor]] $\Delta I$ at $I$ to the [[identity functor]] $Id_D$ such that the component $\iota_I : I\to I$ is the identity morphism, then $I$ is an initial object.

This means we have two things to prove: that the [[Initiality Project - Functor|interpretation functor]]s are natural, and that the interpretation functor into the [[Initiality Project - Term Model|term model]] itself is the identity.  I believe that both should be provable by induction over *raw* syntax with reference only to the [[Initiality Project - Partial Interpretation|partial interpretation functions]], since we have separately [[Initiality Project - Totality|proved]] that these partial functions happen to be total.
