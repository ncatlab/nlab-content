## Definition 

A **Euclidean field** is an [[ordered field]] $F$ with a [[principal square root]] [[partial function]] $\mathrm{sqrt}:[0, \infty) \to F$ which satisfies the [[functional equation]] $\mathrm{sqrt}(x^2) = \vert x \vert$ for all $x \in F$, where $x^2$ is the [[square function]] and $\vert x \vert$ is the [[absolute value]]. Here $[0,\infty)$ denotes the non-negative elements of $F$, hence, either $\{0\}\cup P$, or $(-P)^c$, for $P=\{x\in F \mid x \gt 0\}$ the subset of positive elements, or $\{x\in F\mid x\geq 0\}$ (in [[constructive mathematics]] some care will need to be taken in how this is defined.)

## Examples

* Every [[real closed field]] is a Euclidean field.

* The real numbers constructible as lengths (or their negatives) via straightedge and compass from rational numbers.
