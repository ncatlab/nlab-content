## Definition

### In differential geometry

Let $\pi : P \to X$ be a [[bundle]] in the category [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s. 

The [[dg-algebra]] $\Omega^\bullet_{vert}(P)$ of _vertical differential forms_ on $P$ is the quotient of the [[de Rham complex]] dg-algebra $\Omega^\bullet(P)$ of all forms on $P$, by the dg-ideal of [[horizontal differential forms]], hence of all those forms that vanish when any one vector in their arguments is a [[vertical vector field]] in that it is in the [[kernel]] of the [[differential]] $d \pi : T P \to T X$.

For a trivial bundle $P = X \times F$ the underlying complex of $\Omega^\bullet_{vert}(P)$ is $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X \times F)} \Gamma(T^* F)$.
