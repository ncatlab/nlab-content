## Idea

_Universal spacetimes_ are [[spacetimes]] for which all [[conserved current|conserved]] symmetric [[tensor|rank-2 tensors]], constructed as contractions of [[polynomials]] from the [[metric]], the [[Riemann tensor]] and its [[covariant derivatives]] of arbitrary order, are multiples of the metric. Consequently, metrics of universal spacetimes solve [[vacuum]] [[equations of motion]] of all [[gravity|gravitational theories]], i.e. [[variational calculus|extremize]] the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] with given [[cosmological constant]] and _arbitrary_ [[higher curvature correction]]. In the literature, universal metrics are also discussed as metrics with vanishing quantum corrections and as classical solutions to [[string theory]]. Widely known examples of universal metrics are certain [[Ricci flat]] [[pp-wave spacetimes]].
