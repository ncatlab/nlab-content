##Motivation##

Proj of a graded commutative algebra is a projective variety. Projective schemes are particular cases of schemes so they have nontrivial covers by open affine subschemes. In noncommutative case, Ore localizations (even on one-sided Ore sets) on Ore sets which are multiplicatively generated by finite subsets behave very much like Zariski open subsets. F. van Oystaeyen produced an appropriate notion of a cover in terms of Ore localizations at two-sided Ore subsets in a graded algebra to define a notion of schematic algebra.
