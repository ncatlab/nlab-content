A **coherent category** is a [[regular category]] in which the [[subobject]] lattices $Sub(X)$ all have finite unions which are preserved by the pullback functors $f^*:Sub(Y)\to Sub(X)$.

Any coherent category automatically has a strict [[initial object]].  Moreover, if an object $X$ is the union of two subobjects $A\hookrightarrow X$ and $B\hookrightarrow X$ such that $A\cap B = 0$, then $X = A\sqcup B$ is their coproduct.  Thus, if every pair of objects can be embedded disjointly in some third object, then a coherent category has disjoint finite coproducts and is [[extensive category|extensive]] (or "positive").

A coherent category has an [[internal logic]] which is [[coherent logic]].
