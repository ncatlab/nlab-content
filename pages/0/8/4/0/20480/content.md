Bitcoin is the first [[blockchain]] and the respective [[cryptocurrency]], it is public and using proof of work. Its sequel, [[Ethereum]] is a more modern blockchain platform enabled for [[smart contract]]s and distributed applications from the start. Bitcoin is largely criticized for energy consuming proof of work, big latency and small number of transaction per second; its crypticurrency, also called bitcoin is rather unstable and often used for speculation and even money laundering, rather than for transactions/settlement. Now more efficient third generation distributed ledger projects exist, see [[high performance distributed ledger]].

Description from [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin):

> Bitcoin is a [[cryptocurrency]] which isn’t managed by a bank or agency but in which transactions are recorded in the blockchain that is public and contains records of each and every transaction that takes place. The cryptocurrency is traded by individuals with cryptographic keys that act as wallets. Bitcoin was first invented in 2009 by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are moved in blocks every 10 minutes on a decentralized ledger that connects blocks into a coherent chain dating back to the first genesis block. It was originally described as a peer-to-peer electronic cash but the technology has evolved to emphasize being a settlement layer rather than a payment network. This has left integrated second layer solutions, like Lightning Network, to prioritize that use case. It has remained the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
