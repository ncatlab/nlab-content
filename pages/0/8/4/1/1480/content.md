amongst others.

His work has developed the ideas of  [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead's]] basic programme for [[algebraic homotopy]], using a mix of [[cofibration category|cofibration categories]] and categories with a particular type of [[cylinder functor]], that he calls [[I-category|I-categories]]. These are treated in separate entries.
