A part of his work  developed the ideas of  [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead's]] basic programme for [[algebraic homotopy]], using a mix of [[cofibration category|cofibration categories]] and categories with a particular type of [[cylinder functor]], that he called [[I-category|I-categories]]. These are treated in separate entries. 

Baues  also systematically developed aspects of secondary homological algebra (secondary cohomological operations, secondary Steenrod algebra, secondary chain complexes, secondary triangulated category) which is a form of categorification of the usual homological algebra. He  developed them together to give sound applications in the computations with Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and calculations of homotopy groups of spheres. 

He is also well known for his development of the "cohomology of small categories" with Wirsching, sometimes called [[Baues-Wirsching cohomology]], although versions of this theory existed prior to his contribution.
