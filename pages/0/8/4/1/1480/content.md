Hans-Joachim Baues (d. May 8, 2020) was a German topologist and the author of 

*  _[[Algebraic Homotopy]]_, Cambridge studies in advanced mathematics 15, Cambridge University Press, (1989); 
*  _[[Combinatorial Homotopy and 4-Dimensional Complexes]]_, de Gruyter Expositions in Mathematics 2, Walter de Gruyter, (1991);
*  _[[Homotopy Types]]_, in I.M.James, ed., _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_, 1--72, Elsevier, (1995);
*  _Homotopy type and homology_, Oxford University Press, 1996
* (with Antonio Quintero) _Infinite Homotopy Theory_,  K-monographs in mathematics, Volume 6, Kluwer, 2001;

among other works.

A part of his work  developed the ideas of  [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead's]] basic programme for [[algebraic homotopy]], using a mix of [[cofibration category|cofibration categories]] and categories with a particular type of [[cylinder functor]], that he called [[I-category|I-categories]]. These are treated in separate entries. 

Baues  also systematically developed aspects of secondary homological algebra (secondary cohomological operations, secondary Steenrod algebra, secondary chain complexes, secondary triangulated category) which is a form of categorification of the usual homological algebra. He  developed them together to give sound applications in the computations with Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and calculations of homotopy groups of spheres. 

He is also well known for his development of the "cohomology of small categories" with Wirsching, sometimes called [[Baues-Wirsching cohomology]], although versions of this theory existed prior to his contribution.
