Abstract: This present work is held by me, Ibrahim Mustafa Nasreddin, which I hope this page gets attention for. Note for readers: You may wish to add references in an example bibliography I will include. This paper aims to solve the problem of enjoyability and rigor. The clear idea will be presented like this:
Example a.b (Twisted groupoid gerbes): Given any gerbe $Q$ parameterizing groupoids $G_n(Q)$, the twisted groupoid gerbe, parameterizes more general categories (groupoids) with the knowledge that it behaves badly, which is because of a cohomology class, a badly behaved distinguished class of a space, $p$. A twisted groupoid gerbe is named as $Q(G, p)$.
