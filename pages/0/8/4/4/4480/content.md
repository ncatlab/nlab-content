A [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] $A$ over a commutative ring $k$ is **simple** if it is it is a [[simple object]] in the category of $A$-$A$-[[bimodules]].

This can be stated in more elementary terms in any of the following equivalent ways:

*  $A$ is nontrivial and has no nontrivial two-sided [[ideals]].
*  $A$ has exactly two two-sided ideals (which must be $A$ itself and its [[zero ideal]]).

In [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] algebra, this is too strong; we must say:

*  For each two-sided ideal $I$, $I$ is the zero ideal if and only if $I$ is proper (not equal to $A$).

 By the [[Wedderburn-Artin theorem|Wedderburn--Artin theorem]], any finite-dimensional simple algebra over $k$ is a matrix algebra with entries lying in some [[division algebra]] whose center is $k$.
