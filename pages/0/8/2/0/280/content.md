An _action_ of a [[group]] $G$ on an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[group homomorphism]] $\rho : G \to Aut(x)$, where $Aut(x)$ is the group of [[automorphism|automorphisms]] of $x$.  

A more sophisticated but equivalent definition treats the group $G$ as a category with one object, say $*$.  Then an _action_ of $G$ in the category $C$ is just a [[functor]] 
$$\rho : G \to C .$$  
Here the object $x$ of the previous definition is just $\rho(*)$. 

More generally we can define an _action_ of a [[monoid]] $M$ in the category $C$ to be a functor
$$\rho: M \to C $$
where $M$ is regarded as a one-object category.

The _category of actions_ of $M$ in $C$ is then defined to be the [[functor category]] $C^M$.
