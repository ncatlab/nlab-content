A paraconsistent logic is one that does not include the _law of non-contradiction_, that is, the schema $A, \neg{A} \vdash B$ for all formulas $A$ and $B$.  An example is [[minimal logic]], which simply omits the law $\bot \vdash B$ (which is otherwise used in the proof) from the presentation of intuitionistic logic.

I made a big change here; I would argue that the failure of $\bot \vdash B$ means that '$\bot$' simply doesn\'t mean $\bot$; but in any case, I\'ve always seen the definition given in terms of negation.  In particular, dual-intuitionistic logic has $\bot \vdash B$ (just as intuitionistic logic has $B \vdash \top$ but is still considered paraconsistent.)
