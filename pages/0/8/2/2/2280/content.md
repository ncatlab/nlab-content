The term _sheaf of $n$-types_ is another word for an [[∞-stack]] that has trivial [[homotopy group]]s above degree $n$.
 
Under the [[homotopy hypothesis]] a [[homotopy n-type]] is just a [[∞-groupoid]] that has trivial [[homotopy group]]s above degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Hence a "sheaf of $n$-types" is just a special case of a "sheaf of $\infty$-groupoid"s which is usually called an _$n$-stack_ .
