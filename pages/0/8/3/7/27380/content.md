## Idea

A **infinitary monoidal category** is a generalisation of the concept of a [[monoidal category]] in which there are not only tensor product operations of finite arity, but also of countable arity.

## References

Infinitary monoidal categories are introduced as *$\omega$-monoidal categories*, and infinitary [[symmetric monoidal categories]] are introduces as *series monoidal categories* in the following (see the [related n-Caf√© post](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/11/real_sets.html)):
