## Idea

A _strict 2-functor_ is a [[2-functor]] between [[strict 2-categories]] which strictly respects the [[composition]] operation of [[1-morphisms]] and [[2-morphisms]]. This is in contrast to _[[weak 2-functors]]_ (also called _[[pseudofunctors]]_) which may respect the composition of [[1-morphisms]] only up to [[natural isomorphism]] (hence up to [[2-morphisms]] in the [[2-category of categories]]).

While the generally "correct" concepts in [[2-category theory]] are _[[weak 2-categories]]_ with _[[weak 2-functors]]_ between them, it is often useful to recognize strict 2-functors among weak 2-functors, or to replace, up to [[eqivalence of 2-categories]] and [[pseudonatural transformation]] , weak 2-functors by strict ones.


## Definition

Let [[Cat]] be the _[[1-category]]_ of [[categories]], regarded as a [[BÃ©nabou cosmos]] for [[enriched category theory]] via its [[cartesian closed category]]-[[structure]].

Notice that [[strict 2-categories]] may be identified with [[Cat]]-[[enriched categories]]. Under this identification, strict 2-functors are [[Cat]]-[[enriched functors]].
