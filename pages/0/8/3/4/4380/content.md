I am rewriting (slowly at the moment, but the holidays are coming!) my package to draw 2D diagrams and derivation trees: [dednat4](http://angg.twu.net/dednat4.html). If you would like to use something like that - if it wouldn't be as hard to understand as the current version - please get in touch with me... I have some ideas for making it less dependent on Emacs, but I'd like to discuss them with "normal people" before implementing them...
