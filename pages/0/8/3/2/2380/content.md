In modern [[logic]], we understand that every variable should have a _type_, or _domain of discourse_.  Untyped logic may be seen as simply a special case, in which there is only a single unique type.  (Thus, untyped logic has *one* type, not *no* type.)

It is possible to build [[foundations]] of mathematics on [[type theory]] alone.
