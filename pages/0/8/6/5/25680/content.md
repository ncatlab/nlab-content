## Idea

In [[simplicial type theory]], a [[hom type]] on a type $A$ is a [[dependent type]] $\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y)$ which models the [[hom spaces]] of [[(infinity,1)-category|$\infty$-categories]]. 

## Definition 

There are multiple different formalisms of simplicial homotopy type theory; two of them are given in [Gratzer, Weinberger, & Buchholtz 2024](#GWB24) and in [Riehl & Shulman 2017](#RiehlShulman17), and in each formalism there is a different way to define the hom type. 

### Directed interval via axioms

In [[simplicial homotopy type theory]] where the directed interval primitive $\mathbb{I}$ is defined via axioms as a [[bounded total order]], the hom type is defined as the [[dependent sum type]]

$$\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y) \coloneqq \sum_{f:\mathbb{I} \to A} (f(0) =_A x) \times (f(1) =_A y)$$

### Type theory with shapes formalism

In [[simplicial homotopy type theory]] in the [[type theory with shapes]] formalism, the hom type is defined as the [[extension type]]

$$\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y) \coloneqq \langle \Delta^1 \to A \vert_{[x,y]}^{\partial \Delta^1} \rangle$$

where $\Delta^1$ is the directed interval primitive $\mathbb{2}$ and $\partial \Delta^1$ is the [[boundary]] of $\Delta^1$.
