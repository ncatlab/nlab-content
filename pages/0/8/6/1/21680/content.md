## Idea

A *generalized polycategory* combines the notion of [[generalized multicategory]] with that of [[polycategory]] (or [[prop]]).  While a generalized multicategory is parametrized by a [[monad]] (on a [[double category]] or [[bicategory]] or [[virtual double category]]) that specifies the arities of domains of morphisms, a generalized polycategory is parametrized by *two* such monads, specifying the arities of domains and codomains, together with a suitable sort of [[distributive law]] between them that specifies the allowable composites.

The theory of generalized polycategories is very underdeveloped in the literature compared to generalized multicategories. A Burroni–Leinster style definition, using a double category of spans only, appears in [Koslowski 2005](#Koslowski), and is used to define planar (non-symmetric) polycategories.  A definition using profunctors is implicit in [Garner 2008](#Garner), and is used to define symmetric polycategories, though no general framework in that style has been developed.
