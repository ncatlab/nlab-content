The _Dold-Kan correspondence_ is the name of the [[equivalence]] of 

* the category [[SAb]] of [[simplicial set|simplicial]] abelian groups;

and

* the category $Ch_+(Ab)$ of non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups.

There is an adjoint equivalence

$$
  N : SAb \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Ch_+(An) : \Gamma
$$

where $N$ is the normalized chains functor, also called the [[Moore complex]].

#Remarks#

* There is a whole list of generalizations of this by Brown and Higgins, showing equivalences of various strict infinity-categories [[internal category|internal to]] $Ab$ with $Ch_+(Ab)$. 

*  There is a discussion of some of these and extensions to them to the non-Abelian case, in the entry on [[Moore complex]]
