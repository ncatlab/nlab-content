## Idea

A _rational homology sphere_ is a [[topological space]] which need not be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but which has the same [[rational homotopy theory|rational homology]] as an $n$-sphere.

## Properties

\begin{corollary}
Every [[homology sphere]] is a rational homology sphere.
\end{corollary}

## Examples

\begin{example}
The [[Wu manifold]] $W=SU(3)/SO(3)$ is a [[simply connected]] rational homology $5$-sphere (with non-trivial [[homology]] groups $H_0(W)\cong\mathbb{Z}$, $H_2(W)\cong\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $H_5(W)\cong\mathbb{Z}$), but isn't a [[homotopy sphere|homotopy $5$-sphere]].
\end{example}
