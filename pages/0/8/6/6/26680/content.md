## Idea

A _rational homology sphere_ is a [[topological space]] which need not be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but which has the same [[rational homotopy theory|rational homology]] as an $n$-sphere.

## Properties

\begin{corollary}
Every [[homology sphere]] is a rational homology sphere.
\end{corollary}
