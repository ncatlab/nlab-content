## Definition

An __absorption monoid__ or __annihilation monoid__ is a [[monoid]] $(M,1,\cdot)$ with an element $0\in M$ satisfying the absorption/annihilation axioms: for all $a \in M$, $0 \cdot a = 0$ and $a \cdot 0 = 0$. 

## Properties

### Zero divisors

A non-zero element $a \in M$ is a __[[zero divisor]]__ if thete exists a non-zero element $b \in M$ such that $a \cdot b = 0$. 

### Integral cancellative monoids

An absorption monoid such that $0 \neq 1$ and has no zero divisors other than zero is called an __integral cancellable monoid__. Equivalently, an integral cancellable monoid is an absorption monoid with $0 \neq 1$ whose largest submonoid not containing $0$ is a [[cancellative monoid]]. 

### Division monoid

An integral cancellable monoid such that all non-zero elements are invertible is called a __division monoid__. Equivalently, a  division monoid is an absorption monoid with $0 \neq 1$ whose largest submonoid not containing $0$ is a [[group]]. 

## Examples

* The multiplicative monoid of every [[rig]] is an absorption monoid. 

* Every join-[[semilattice]] with a [[top element]] and evety meet-semilattice with a [[bottom element]] is an absorption monoid.
