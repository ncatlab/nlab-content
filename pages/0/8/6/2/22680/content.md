## Definition

An __absorption monoid__ or __annihilation monoid__ is a [[monoid]] $(M,1,\cdot)$ that is also an [[absorption magma]] $(M,0)$. 

## Properties

### Zero divisors

A non-zero element $a \in M$ is a __[[zero divisor]]__ if thete exists a non-zero element $b \in M$ such that $a \cdot b = 0$. 

### Integral cancellable monoids

An absorption monoid that has no zero divisors other than zero is called an __integral cancellable monoid__. Equivalently, an integral cancellable monoid is an absorption monoid whose largest submonoid not containing $0$ is a [[cancellative monoid]]. 

### Division monoid

An integral cancellable monoid such that all non-zero elements are invertible is called a __division monoid__. Equivalently, a  division monoid is an absorption monoid whose largest submonoid not containing $0$ is a [[group]]. 

### Localization and group completion

The [[localization of a monoid|localization]] of an absorption monoid at $0$ is the [[trivial group]]. Because of this, the [[group completion]] of any absorption monoid is the [[trivial group]]. This is why one speaks of division monoids instead of groups in the context of absorption monoids, and in particular, why the additive [[identity element]] in any [[trivial ring|nontrivial]] [[field]] has no multiplicative [[inverse]]. 

## Examples

* The multiplicative monoid of every [[rig]] is an absorption monoid. 

* Every join-[[semilattice]] with a [[top element]] and evety meet-semilattice with a [[bottom element]] is an absorption monoid.
