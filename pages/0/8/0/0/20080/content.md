## Idea

In [[string theory]] _type 0_ refers to a kind of [[perturbative string theory]] where the [[strings]] themselves are [[superstrings]] (hence have [[supersymmetry]] on their [[worldsheet]]) but their [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] [[effective field theory]] is not supersymmetric, in fact does not even contain any [[fermion fields]].

Technically, this comes from one particular choice of [[GSO projection]] of the [[superstring]] which breaks all target space supersymmetry, in contrast to the other choices of [[GSO projection]] which give the [[type IIA string theory]], [[type IIB string theory]].
