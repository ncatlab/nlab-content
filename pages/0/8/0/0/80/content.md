#Idea#

Philosophical interest in <i>n</i>-categories may be characterised as belonging to one of two kinds.

* **Metaphysical**: A new language which may prove to be as important for philosophy as predicate logic has been for Bertrand Russell and successive analytic philosophers. 

* **Illustrative of mathematics as intellectual enquiry**: Such a reconstitution of the fundamental language of mathematics reveals much about mathematics as a tradition of enquiry stretching back several millennia, for instance, the continued willingness to reconsider basic concepts.

##Metaphysical##

* Higher category theory refines the notion of sameness to allow more subtle variants.

* There ought to be a categorified logic, or 2-logic. There are some suggestions that existing work on modal logic is relevant.

##Enquiry##

To categorify mathematical constructions properly, one must have understood their essential features. This leads us to consider what it is to get concepts 'right'. Which kind of 'realism' is suitable for mathematics? Which virtues should a mathematical community possess to further its ends: a knowledge of its history, close attention to instruction and the sharing of knowledge, a willingness to admit to what is currently lacking in its programmes?
