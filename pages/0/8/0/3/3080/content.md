A shape fibration is an adaptation of the notion of [[Hurewicz fibration]] from the setup of [[homotopy theory]] to [[shape theory]] (of [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[metric space|metrisable spaces]]). 

A map between metric [[compactum|compacta]] $p : E\to B$ is called a 
**shape fibration**, provided it is induced by a level map $p : E\to B$ of ANR-sequences satisfying the [[approximate homotopy lifting property]] with respect to any metric space $X$ and the lifting index, and lifting mesh do 
not depend on $X$. 

If, more generally, $E$ and $B$ are locally compact metric spaces. A 
[[proper map]] $p : E\to B$ is a **shape fibration** if for any compact $C\subset B$ the restriction of $p$ to a map $p^{-1}(C)\to C$ is a shape fibration between metric compacta. 

If $E$ and $B$ are locally compact metric ANR's then the notion of shape fibration coincides with a notion of an [[approximate fibration]].
