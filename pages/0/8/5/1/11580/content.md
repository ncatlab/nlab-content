## Idea

As a metaphor for his approach of problem solving via theory building, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] once referred to the how the rising sea slowly but eventually surrounds solid land masses. This metaphor became more or less proverbial as "The Rising Sea" analogy.

> The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it.. yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance. [Grothendieck  [[RÃ©coltes et semailles]], 1985&#8211;1987, pp. 552-3-1
