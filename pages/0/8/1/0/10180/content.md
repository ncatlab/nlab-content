## Idea

The [[classifying topos]] for the [[theory of objects]], or the _object classifier_[^fine], as it is traditionally called, is  the [[presheaf topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ on the [[opposite category]] of [[FinSet]].

[^fine]: As this is not to be confused with the notion of an [[object classifier]] in an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]], we prefer to call it in full the _classifying topos for the theory of objects_.

What motivates the terminology, is that for any [[topos]] $E$, [[geometric morphisms]] $E \to [FinSet,Set]$ correspond to [[objects]] of $E$.

Similarly, the _theory of pointed objects_ $O_\ast$  is classified by the presheaf topos $[FinSet_\ast, Set]$ on the opposite $FinSet_\ast^{op}$ of the category of finite [[pointed sets]] whose skeleton is [[Segal's category]], hence $[FinSet_\ast, Set]$ is equivalent to the topos of "$\Gamma$-sets" (cf. [[Gamma-space]] and for its role as a classifying space the following MO-discussion: [link](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/85600/what-do-gamma-sets-classify)) . More generally, classifying toposes for [[Horn theory|universal Horn theories]] $T$ correspond to the respective toposes of covariant set-valued functors on the category of finitely presentable models of $T$ (Blass&Scedrov (1983)).

The _generic_ or _universal object_ $U$ is the inclusion $FinSet\hookrightarrow Set$: every object $X$ of $E$ arises from some geometric morphism $f$ as $X\cong f^\ast(U)$ . (For another remarkable property of this inclusion functor see [[ultrafilter monad]].)

As the role of the object classifier bears some ressemblance to the role of the [[polynomial ring]] $k[x]$ over a ground ring $k$ that 'classifies' elements of k-algebras $A$ via $A\cong Hom_k(k[x], A)$, it is traditionally denoted $\mathcal{S}[U]$, the 'adjunction' of the free (=generic) object to the base topos $\mathcal{S}$, in our case $Set$.

The analogy between topos theory and algebra is pursued further in Bunge&Funk (2006) where, in the context of topos [[distributions]] and the '[[symmetric algebra]]' of a topos (aka the _symmetric topos_), $\mathcal{S}[U]$ is shown to play the role of the real line $\mathbf R$ in [[functional analysis]].


## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The classifying topos $[FinSet, Set]$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of finitary [[endofunctors]] on [[Set]] (those that commute with [[filtered colimits]]):

$$
  [FinSet, Set] \simeq End_f(Set)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Because every [[set]] is the [[filtered colimit]] over its finite [[subsets]].

###### Remark

Since the category $End_f(Set) \hookrightarrow End(Set)$ of [[finitary monads]] is naturally a [[monoidal category]] under composition, this induces the structure of a (non-cartesian) [[monoidal category]] also on the [[classifying topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ and hence makes it a [[monoidal topos]]. A [[monoid]] with respect to this monoidal structure is equivalently a [[finitary monad]]. 

A related point of view is that $FinSet^{op}$ is the [[free construction|free]] [[cartesian monoidal category]] generated by an object (or by the terminal category), and its [[free cocompletion]] $[FinSet, Set]$ is the free [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[monoidally cocomplete category]] generated by an object. Thus $[FinSet, Set]$ plays the role of cartesian analogue to $[\mathbb{P}^{op}, Set]$, the free [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidally cocomplete category]] on an object, where $\mathbb{P} = Core(FinSet)$ is the [[core]] of [[FinSet]]. And in the same way that $[\mathbb{P}^{op}, Set]$ is a [[monoidal topos]] whose monoids are symmetric or permutative [[operads]] (as discussed at _[operad -- a detailed onceptual treatment](operad#Conceptual)_), so $[FinSet, Set]$ is seen as a monoidal topos whose monoids are cartesian operads, aka [[Lawvere theories]]. Some material on this can be found at _[[toddtrimble:Towards a doctrine of operads]]_.

###### Remark

What concerns other base toposes than $Set$, it is a theorem due to [[Andreas Blass]] that $\mathcal{S}$ has an object classifier $\mathcal{S}[U]$ precisely if $\mathcal{S}$ has a [[natural number object]]. A consequence of this, discussed in sec. B4.2 of (Johnstone 2002,I p.431), is that classifying toposes for [[geometric theories]] over $\mathcal{S}$ exist precisely if the object classifier $\mathcal{S}[U]$ exists.
