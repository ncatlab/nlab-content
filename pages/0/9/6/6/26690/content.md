The notion of **corelation** is the formal dual to that of [[relation]], thus it denotes a jointly epimorphic [[cospan]] 
$$
X \to P \leftarrow Y
$$
In a category with [[coproducts]], all corelations factor through the coproduct of $X$ and $Y$. In fact, as relations can be considered subobjects of the product, corelations can be considered [[quotients]] of the coproduct (esp. when $X+Y \to P$ is [[regular epi]]).
