## Idea

The notion of **co-relations** is the [[formal dual]] to that of [[relations]], thus referring to [[jointly epimorphic family|jointly epimorphic]] [[cospans]] 
$$
  X \longrightarrow P \longleftarrow Y
 \,.
$$

In a [[category]] with [[coproducts]], all co-relations factor through the [[coproduct]] of $X$ and $Y$. In fact, just as relations can be considered as [[subobjects]] of the [[Cartesian product]], so corelations can be considered [[quotients]] of the coproduct (esp. when $X+Y \to P$ is a [[regular epimorphism]]).
