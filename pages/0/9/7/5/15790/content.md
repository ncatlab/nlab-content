## Idea

The lisse-&#233;tale site of a [[scheme]] $X$ is the category of $U \to X$ which are [[smooth morphisms]] with [[coverings]] defined as in the [[étale site]].

The lisse-&#233;tale site is not so well-behaved, but it is used in the study of [[algebraic stacks]] in order to have a site with more affine opens, hence better suited for the discussion of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].
