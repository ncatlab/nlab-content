Among the various [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model structures on simplicial presheaves]] (see there for details, background and motivation), the _&#268;ech_ model structure is in between the [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The latter is obtained by localizing the global structure at local weak equivalences -- in particular [[hypercovers]] -- , while the &#268;ech structure is obtained by localizing only at [[?ech covers]].

Accordingly, the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the &#268;ech model structure has as its [[cohomology]] theory [[?ech cohomology]].

See the further remarks at [[hypercover]].

A detailed though unfinished account of the &#268;ech model structure is given in

But beware of this document is unfinished. In particular there is some statement somewhere that makes it sound as if &#268;ech covers are equal to hypercovers, while the rest of the text emphasises how they are distinct.
