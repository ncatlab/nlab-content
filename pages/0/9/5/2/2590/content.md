The [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]] may seem to be a topic curiously disconnected from the the rest of mathematics. This is not quite so. This page lists examples where questions of foundations do affect questions and problems in "real world" mathematics.

#Whitehead problem#


The following question is called the **Whitehead problem**

Every [[free abelian group]] $A$ satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Is, conversely, every abelian group $A$ that satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ a free abelian group?

When formalizing [[group theory]] within [[ETCS]] as a [[set theory]], then this is question is undecidable.  (It is still undecidable in [[ZFC]], equivalently in ETCS + Collection.)  In some models it is true, while other models have counterexamples.
