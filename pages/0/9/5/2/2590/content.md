## Whitehead problem

The following question is called the **Whitehead problem**

Every [[free abelian group]] $A$ satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Is, conversely, every abelian group $A$ that satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ a free abelian group?

When formalizing [[group theory]] within [[ETCS]] as a [[set theory]], then this question is undecidable.  (It is still undecidable in [[ZFC]], equivalently in ETCS + Collection.)  In some models it is true, while other models have counterexamples.

## Fermat's last theorem

It was [conjectured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function_arithmetic#Friedman.27s_grand_conjecture) by Harvey Friedman that all theorems involving finitary objects published in _Annals of Mathematics_ (for argument's sake) can be proved in [[Elementary Function Arithmetic]] (EFA), a weak fragment of [[Peano arithmetic]]. One implication is that [[Fermat's last theorem]] is provable in PA. There is a current program of research by Angus MacIntyre to show this last fact directly. From a category theoretic point of view, [[Colin McLarty]] has shown that all of the material in [[SGA]] relies only on quite weak foundations, namely MacLane set theory with one [[universe]] (weaker than the theory $V_{\omega\cdot 3}$ considered in [[ZFC]])
