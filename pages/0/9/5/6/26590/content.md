## Idea

De Finetti's theorem is one of the central results of [[probability theory]], and usually refers to any of the following related statements:

* Every [[exchangeable probability measure]] on an [[infinite product]] is a unique [[mixture]] of [[iid]] ones. 
* Every infinite sequence of [[exchangeable random variables]] exhibits [[conditional independence]] given the [[empirical distribution]].
* Every infinite sequence of [[exchangeable random variables]] exhibits [[conditional independence]] given the [[exchangeable sigma-algebra]]. 

The statement involves [[mixtures]] of [[probability measures]], and so probability measures *over* probability measures. This recursive construction is a possible motivation for introducing [[probability monad|monads in probability theory]].
Indeed, [[category-theoretic approaches to probability theory|categorically]], the theorem can equivalently be expressed as follows:

* The [[Giry monad]] is the [[limit]] of an [[exchangeable]] process in the category of [[Markov kernels]].


## Motivation

There are several ways of motivating de Finetti's theorem. 
Here is one, which is very close to de Finetti's original motivation, as explained in his original paper ([de Finetti'29](#definetti_og)).

Consider a repeated experiment where we are uncertain about the distribution. For the simplest possible example, imagine repeatedly flipping a coin, but without knowing in advance the bias of the coin.
One may be tempted to assume that the coin flips are [[stochastic independence|independent]], since "a coin has no memory". However, this is not quite the case:

* What we can say is that the coin flips are [[exchangeable]], since the coin is always the same, and so every flip, and each subsequence of flips, follows the same distribution.
* However, in general [[stochastic independence|independence]] fails: *there is* hidden information in past flips about future flips: by flipping the coin repeatedly, we can get more and more certain about the coin's bias. (For example, if we keep getting "heads", we may start suspecting that the coin is not fair.)
* If we instead *know exactly* the bias of the coin, there is no more hidden information that past flips have about future ones. Therefore, *given the bias of the coin*, the flips are [[conditionally independent]].

De Finetti's theorem says precisely that for every [[exchangeable]] process we have [[conditional independence]] of the variables given their [[empirical distribution|distribution]].


## In measure-theoretic probability

Let $X$ be a [[standard Borel space]] (for example, the real line), and form the [[infinite product]] $X^\mathbb{N}$. 

Notice first of all that given the space $P X$ of [[probability measures]] over $X$ (the [[Giry monad]]), the [[iid random variables#iid_samples|iid sampling map]] $samp_\mathbb{N}:P X\to X^\mathbb{N}$ is [[exchangeable]]. In other words, given any finite [[permutation]] of the coordinates $\sigma: X^\mathbb{N}\to X^\mathbb{N}$, and denoting the kernel induced by $\sigma$ again by $\sigma$, the following diagram of [[Markov kernels]] commutes:
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
column sep=large,%
]
& X^\mathbb{N} \ar{dd}{\sigma} \\
PX \ar{ur}{samp_\mathbb{N}} \ar{dr}[swap]{samp_\mathbb{N}} \\
& X^\mathbb{N}
\end{tikzcd}

Consider now any (other) [[exchangeable probability measure]] $p$ on $X^\mathbb{N}$. If we write it as a Markov kernel $1\to X^\mathbb{N}$, exchangeability means by definition that, once again, the following diagram commutes for every $\sigma$:
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
column sep=large,%
]
& X^\mathbb{N} \ar{dd}{\sigma} \\
1 \ar{ur}{p} \ar{dr}[swap]{p} \\
& X^\mathbb{N}
\end{tikzcd}

A way of stating **de Finetti's theorem** is now to say that $P X$ is the categorical [[limit]] of the diagram formed by the $\sigma$ (the [[group action]] of finite permutations). In other words, given any exchangeable measure $p$ (or more generally any exchangeable kernel), there exists a unique measure (or kernel) $u$ making the following diagram commute:
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
sep=huge,%
]
&& X^\mathbb{N} \ar{dd}{\sigma} \\
1 \ar[dashed]{r}[near end]{u} \ar{urr}{p} \ar{drr}[swap]{p} & PX \ar{ur}[near start, swap]{samp_\mathbb{N}} \ar[near start]{dr}{samp_\mathbb{N}} \\
&& X^\mathbb{N}
\end{tikzcd}

Explicitly, this means that we can write $p$ as a [[convex mixture]] (with measure $u$) of [[iid measures]]: for every measurable $A_1,\dots,A_n\subseteq X$,
$$
p(A_1\times\dots\times A_n) \;=\; \int_{P X} samp_\mathbb{N}(A_1\times\dots\times A_n|q) \, u(dq) \;=\; \int_{P X} \big(q(A_1)\cdots q(A_n)\big)\,u(dq) .
$$

This allows to define the space $P X$, i.e. the [[Giry monad]], purely from its universal property. 
In terms of [[representable presheaves]], one can say that *the space of probability measure represents exchangeable processes*.

Moreover, since the [[iid random variables#iid_samples|iid sampling map]] denotes [[conditional independence]] of its outputs given its input, the theorem implies that the various copies of $X$ are conditionally independent given the distribution ($P X$).


## In Markov categories

Just as it happens for [[standard Borel spaces]], in any [[Markov category#representable_markov_categories|representable Markov category]] with [[Markov category#conditionals|conditionals]] and [[Markov category#kolmogorov_products|Kolmogorov products]], a version of de Finetti's theorem holds, and the proof is completely analogous to the measure-theoretic one ([FGP'21](#fritz_definetti)).

Conversely, one can define *de Finetti limits* in a Markov category as particular [[limits]] which are compatible with the Markov structure, and show that such a limit always gives a [[probability monad]], making the Markov category representable ([FFL'23](#quantum_definetti), section 3.6).
