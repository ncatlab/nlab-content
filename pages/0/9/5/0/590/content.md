A [[colimit]] in a category $C$ is the same as a [[limit]] in the [[opposite category]], $C^{op}$.

Here are some important examples of colimits:

* A colimit of the [[diagram|empty diagram]] is an [[initial object]].
* A colimit of a diagram consisting of two (or more) objects is their [[coproduct]].
* A colimit of a [[span]] is a [[pushout]].
* A colimit of two (or more) [[parallel morphisms]] is a [[coequalizer]].
