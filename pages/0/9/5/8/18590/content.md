## Idea

In [[analysis]] or [[differential geometry]], a _derivative_ is the result of applying [[differentiation]] to a [[differentiable map]]. 

## Variants

* [[total derivative]]

* [[partial derivative]]

* [[derivative of a distribution]]

* [[exterior derivative]]

* [[covariant derivative]]

* [[exterior covariant derivative]]

* [[functional derivative]]

* [[Fr√©chet derivative]]

* [[Lie derivative]]

* [[directional derivative]]

* [[Radon-Nikodym derivative]]

* [[Schwarzian derivative]]

## Properties


* [[Stokes theorem]]

* [[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]]


## Related concepts

* [[integral]]

* [[derivation]]
