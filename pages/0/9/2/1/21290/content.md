## X-Ray Transform

The X-ray transform is the operator
$$Xf(l) := \int_l f\,d\lambda(l),$$
where $l\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a line, and $\lambda$ the Lebesgue measure on the line. The manifold $M_n$ can be represented as
$$M_n = \{(\sigma, x)\in S^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R}^n \mid \langle x,\omega\rangle = 0\},$$
where $(\sigma,x)$ represents a line that passes through $x$ with direction $\omega$. It is an open problem to determine the exponents $1\le p,q,r\le\infty$ for which the following inequality holds:
$$\Vert Xf \Vert$$
