A [[full subcategory]] $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ is __topologizing__ if

* it is closed with respect to finite [[coproduct]]s (taken in $A$)

* with any object, it contains all its [[subquotient]]s in $A$

A topologizing subcategory is a [[thick subcategory]] if it is also closed under [[extension]]s. 

The classes of topologizing subcategories, [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] topologizing  subcategories and [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] topologizing subcategories are closed under [[Gabriel multiplication]] defined on the class of full subcategories of $A$.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Where does the word 'topologizing' come from?

[[Zoran Skoda]]: I am not completely sure anymore, but I think 
it is from ring theory, where people looked at the localizations at topologizing categories. There exist some topologies on various sets of ideals like Jacobson topology, so it is something of that sort in the language of subcategories instead of the language of filters of ideals. I'll consult old references like Popescu, maybe I recall better. In any case it is pretty standard and has long history in usage: both classical and modern. I think there is some proposition in Popescu's book which explains, but maybe I have seen it elsewhere.
