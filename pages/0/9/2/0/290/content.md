#Higher categories in quantum field theory#

Even though _quantum field theory_ has been around for decades and has been very successful both as a phenomenological model in exerimental physics as well as a source of deep mathemtical structures and theorems, from a mathematical perspective it is still to some extent mysterious. 

There are essentially two alternative approaches for formalizing quantum field theory and making it accessible to mathemtatical treatment: [[AQFT]] and [[FQFT]]. Both lead to [[higher category theory|higher categorical structures]].

There are some indications that such [[higher category theory|higher categorical structures]] are essential for clarifying some of the mysteries of quantum field theory, such as the [[path integral]]. While this is far from being clarified, this is what motivates research in higher categorical structures in QFT. 

Our is the age to figure this out.
