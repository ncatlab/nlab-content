## Idea

A [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on [[singularities]] in a [[variety]].

For a [[smooth variety]] $X$ then the full bounded [[derived category]] $D^b(X) = D^b(Coh X)$ coincides with that of [[perfect complexes]], while for a singular variety there are objects not represented by perfect complexes. Hence these may be attributed to be due to the contribution of the singularities. The quotient $D^b(X)/Perf(X)$ hence serves as the derived category of the singularities themselves.

$\mathbb{C}^\times$-equivariant singularity category is in good cases equivalent to the category of matrix
factorizations, which is the category of B-branes
in a [[Landau-Ginzburg theory]].

One sometimes considers a dg-[[enhanced triangulated category|enhancement]] (which is unique by Orlov-Lunts) of the derived category instead, the dg-category of singularities.

If a variety $Y$ over a field $k$ is the zero scheme of a section of a vector bundle on a smooth $k$-variety, then there is a construction of a singular variety $Z$ so that  $k^\times$-equivariant/graded singularity category of $Z$
is equivalent (as an [[enhanced triangulated category]]) to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on $Y$:
