## Idea

A [[derived category]] of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on [[singularities]] in a [[variety]].

For a [[smooth variety]] $X$ then the full bounded [[derived category]] $D^b(X)$ coincides with that of [[perfect complexes]], while for a singular variety there are objects not represented by perfect complexes. Hence these may be attributed to be due to the contribution of the singularities. The quotient $D^b(X)/Perf(X)$ hence serves as the derived category of the singularities themselves.
