## Idea

The MacNeille real numbers are a version of [[real numbers]] defined by forming the [[MacNeille completion]] of the [[rational numbers]].  In [[classical mathematics]], the MacNeille real numbers consist of the [[real numbers]], $\infty$, and $-\infty$; thus, they are the same as the [[extended real numbers]].  However, in [[constructive mathematics]], they are different (and less well behaved); it is not a constructive theorem that every bounded MacNeille number is located (hence a real number in the usual sense of constructive mathematics).
