**Raoul Bott** (1923--2005) was one of the great 20th century topologists and geometers. Among his famous works, one should mention the [[Bott periodicity theorem]] (of importance in [[K-theory]]), studies in [[Morse theory]] (including the study of Bott--Morse functions), the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem in geometric representation theory, the study of fixed point (localization) formulas (the Atiyah--Bott fixed point theorem) and the Atiyah-Bott-Patodi slick proof of the index theorem via the heat kernel expansion.
