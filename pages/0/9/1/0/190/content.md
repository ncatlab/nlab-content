_Cat_ is a name for the category of all [[category|categories]].  To avoid set-theoretic problems related to Russell's paradox, it is typical to define _Cat_ to be the category with:

* [[small category|small categories]] as [[object|objects]],

* [[functor|functors]] as [[morphism|morphisms]].

We can also use _Cat_ to stand for the [[strict 2-category]] with:

* small categories as objects,

* functors as morphisms,

* [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] as [[2-morphism|2-morphisms]].

Here we could even allow [[large category|large categories]] without running into Russell's paradox.

Do you have a precise mathematical meaning in mind for that last sentence?  Certainly, in ordinary ZF set theory, there is no 2-category of large categories, since a proper class cannot be an element of another proper class.  On the other hand, if we assume a universe, then we can have a (very large) 2-category of large categories, but we can also have a very large 1-category of large categories.
