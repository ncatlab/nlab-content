## Idea

Proto-exact category is a nonadditive generalization of a [[Quillen exact category]]. The definition is self-dual as the notion of Quillen exact category is.

## Definition 

A proto-exact category is a pointed category $A$, with zero object $0$, together with two
classes of morphisms, $I$ and $D$, called inflations and deflations such that

(i) each morphism $0\to U$ is an inflation and each morphism $U\to 0$ is a deflation

(ii) classes $I$ and $D$ are closed under composition and contain all isomorphisms

(iii) each square of the form

 $$\array{
U &\rightarrow &V\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
W &\rightarrow & Z
}$$
where the horizontal arrows are inflations and the vertical arrows are deflations is a pushout iff it is a pullback

(iv) Every diagram of the form $W\rightarrow Z\leftarrow V$ where $W\rightarrow Z$ is a deflation and $Z\leftarrow V$ a inflation may be completed to a biCartesian square of the form in (iii)

(v) Every diagram of the form $W\leftarrow U\rightarrow V$ where $W\leftarrow U$ is an inflation and $U\rightarrow V$ a deflation may be completed to a biCartesian square of the form in (iii)

> _Proto-exact categories_, introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov, are a generalization of Quillen exact categories which provide a framework for defining algebraic K-theory and Hall algebras in a \emph{non-additive} setting. This formalism is well-suited to the study of categories whose objects have strong combinatorial flavor.
In this paper, we show that the categories of modules over semirings and hyperrings - algebraic structures which have gained prominence in tropical geometry - carry proto-exact structures.
In the first part, we prove that the category of modules over a semiring is equipped with a proto-exact structure; modules over an idempotent semiring have a strong connection to matroids. We also prove that the category of algebraic lattices $\mathcal{L}$ has a proto-exact structure, and furthermore that the subcategory of $\mathcal{L}$ consisting of finite lattices is equivalent to the category of finite $\mathcal{B}$-modules as proto-exact categories, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the _Boolean semifield_. We also discuss some relations between $\mathcal{L}$ and geometric lattices (simple matroids) from this perspective.
In the second part, we prove that the category of modules over a hyperring has a proto-exact structure. In the case of finite modules over the _Krasner hyperfield_ $\mathbf{K}$, a well-known relation between finite $\mathbf{K}$-modules and finite incidence geometries yields a combinatorial interpretation of exact sequences.
