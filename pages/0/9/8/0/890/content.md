## Definitions

Given a [[set]] $S$ and an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$, the __quotient set__ of $S$ by $\equiv$ is the set $S/{\equiv}$ whose elements are the elements of $S$ but where two elements are now considered [[equality|equal]] if in $S$ they were merely equivalent.

If changing the definition of equality like this is not allowed in your [[foundations]] of mathematics, then you can still define $S/{\equiv}$ as a [[subset]] of the [[power set]] of $S$ as follows:
\[\label{setdef}
A \in S/{\equiv} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists (x: S),\; A = \{y: S \;\mid\; x \equiv y\}\]
If you don\'t have (extensional) power sets either, then you\'ll have to use [[setoids]] (in which case, perhaps you\'d do better to change your terminology as described there).  Alternatively, don\'t worry about any of this and just include the existence of [[quotient objects]] in [[Set]] as an axiom (the __axiom of quotient sets__, which you have if you assume that $\Set$ is a [[pretopos]] or a [[Grothendieck topos]] as given by [[Giraud's axioms]]). There are actually two possible axiom of quotient sets, depending on what definition of relation one uses. 

* The weaker version of the axiom of quotient sets is the one which states that the [[coherent category]] $Set$ is a [[pretopos]]: that every [[internal equivalence relation]] on a set $A$, defined as a subset $\equiv$ of the Cartesian product $A \times A$ satisfying reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry, has a quotient set $A/\equiv$. 

* The stronger version of the axiom of quotient sets states that every [[proposition]] $x \equiv y$ in the [[context]] of the [[variables]] $x \in A$ and $y \in A$ which satisfies reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry has a quotient set $A/\equiv$. In some presentations of [[set theory]], this is an [[axiom schema]] of quotient sets.  

In any case, the element of $S/{\equiv}$ that comes from the element $x$ of $S$ may be denoted $[x]_{\equiv}$, or simply $[x]$ if ${\equiv}$ is understood, or simply $x$ if there will be no confusion as to which set it is an element of.  This $[x]$ is called the __[[equivalence class]]__ of $x$ with respect to $\equiv$; the term 'class' here is an old word for 'set' (in the sense of 'subset') and refers to the definition (eq:setdef) above, where $[x]$ is literally the set $A$.

### As initial objects in a category

Let $S$ be a [[set]] and let $\equiv$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on $S$. Let us define a *quotient set algebra of $S$ and $\equiv$* to be a set $A$ with a function $\iota S \to A$ such that for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $(a \equiv b)$ implies $(\iota(a) = \iota(b))$. 

A *quotient set algebra homomorphism of $S$ and $\equiv$* is a function $f: A \to B$ between two quotient set algebras $A$ and $B$ such that for all $a \in S$, $f(\iota_A(a)) = \iota_B(a)$.

The *category of quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$* is the category $QSA(S, \equiv)$ whose objects $Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ are quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$ and whose morphisms $Mor(A, B)$ for $A \in Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ and $B \in Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ are quotient set algebra homomorphisms of $S$ and $\equiv$. The **quotient set** of $S$ and $\equiv$, denoted $S/\equiv$, is defined as the initial object in the category of quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$. 

### In type theory

Let $(T,\equiv)$ be a [[symmetric proset]]. The __quotient set__ $T/\equiv$ is a [[higher inductive type]] inductively generated by the following:

* a function $\iota: T \to T/\equiv$

* a family of dependent terms
$$a:T, b:T \vdash eq_{T/\equiv}(a, b): (a \equiv b) \to (\iota(a) =_{T/\equiv} \iota(b))$$

* a family of dependent terms 
$$a:T/\equiv, b:T/\equiv \vdash \tau(a, b): isProp(a =_{T/\equiv} b)$$

The axiom of quotient sets in [[type theory]] says that every [[symmetric proset]] is a [[set]]. 

## Generalisations

Quotient sets in [[Set]] generalise to [[quotient object]]s in other categories. In particular, an [[exact category]] is a [[regular category]] in which every [[congruence]] on every object has an effective quotient object.
