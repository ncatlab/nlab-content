## Automorphism 2-groups 

For $C$ any [[2-category]] and $c \in C$ any object of it, the category $Aut_C(c) \subset Hom_C(c,c)$ of auto-equivalences of $c$ and invertible 2-morphisms between these is naturally a [[2-group]], whose group product comes from the horizontal composition in $C$.

If $C$ is a [[strict 2-category]] there is the notion of strict [[automorphism 2-group]]. See there for more details on that case.

For instance if $C = Grp_2 \subset Grpd$ is the 2-category of [[group]] obtained by regarding groups as one-object [[groupoids]] ([[delooping groupoids]]), then for $H \in Grp$ a group, its automorphism 2-group obtained this way is the strict 2-group

$$
  AUT(H) 
   \;\coloneqq\; 
  Aut_{Grp_2}(H)
   \;\coloneqq\;
  Aut(\mathbf{B}H)
$$

corresponding to the [[crossed module]] $(H \stackrel{Ad}{\to} Aut(H))$, where $Aut(H)$ is the ordinary [[automorphism group]] of $H$.
