#Definition#

The **$n$-globe** $G_n$ is the [[globular set]] represented by the object $[n]$ in the [[globular set|globular category]] $G$:

$$
  G_n := Hom_G(-,[n])
  \,.
$$

There is a unique structure of an [[omega-category]], an $n$-category in fact, on the $n$-globe. This makes the collection of $n$-globes arrange themselves into a _co-globular $\omega$-category_, i.e. a functor

$$
  G \to \omega Cat
$$
$$
  [n] \mapsto G_n
  \,.
$$

In this sense $n$-globes are the globular analog of the co-simplicial [[oriental]]s.
