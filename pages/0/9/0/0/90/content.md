#Definition#

The **$n$-globe** $G_n$ is the [[globular set]] represented by the object $[n]$ in the [[globular set|globular category]] $G$:

$$
  G_n := Hom_G(-,[n])
  \,.
$$

There is a unique structure of a [[strict omega-category]], an $n$-category in fact, on the $n$-globe. This makes the collection of $n$-globes arrange themselves into a _co-globular $\omega$-category_, i.e. a functor

$$
  G \to \omega Cat
$$
$$
  [n] \mapsto G_n
  \,.
$$

In this sense $n$-globes are the globular analog of the co-simplicial [[oriental|orientals]].

Could you say that, given a [[globular set]] that the $n$-globes are _pointed_ $n$-spheres generated by repeated application of the identity assigning map, i.e.

$$g_v\in G_n \implies g_v = i^n(v), v\in G_0$$

?

Or is an $n$-globe more like an $n$-[[directed n-graph|loop]]?
