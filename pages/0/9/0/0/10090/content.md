## Idea

### In bosonic string theory - The tachyon vacuum

The [[tachyon]] mode in the [[open string|open]] [[bosonic string]] spectrum is an indication that its [[effective quantum field theory|effective]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]] describes [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] about an _[[unstable vacuum]]_ which will [[vacuum decay|decay]] via [[tachyon condensation]]. 

It was argued in [Sen 99, Section 4](#Sen99) that, since the [[open string|open]] [[bosonic string]] technically propagates with its endpoints on the space-filling [[D25-brane]], that instability must be the instability of the D25, which wants to decay to a "true bosonic string vacuum", often called the _tachyon vacuum_.

This conjecture became famous as **Sen's conjecture**. It was subsequently checked to be true by numerical means in [[open bosonic string field theory]]. Moreover, using string field theory it became possible to study that non-perturbative state in which the [[D25-brane]] is indeed gone. There were several arguments that indeed in the vicinity of this state the perturbative open string has disappeared and turned into the closed bosonic string.

A breakthrough happened in 2005, when [[Martin Schnabl]] found an analytic expression for this "tachyon vacuum" ([Schnabl 05](#Schnabl05)).

### In superstring theory -- The K-theory conjecture

Sen's conjecture actually originates in [[superstring theory]] ([Sen 98](#Sen98)). While here the tachyon mode for [[open string|open]] [[superstrings]] on [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[D-brane]]-configurations is famously absent, signifying the [[vacuum stability|stability]] of [[perturbative superstring vacua]],
there are still [[tachyon]] modes in [[open string|open]] [[superstrings]] stretching between [[D-branes]] and _[[anti-D-branes]]_.

Here the conjecture states that the respective [[tachyon condensation]] witnesses the annihilation of the brane/anti-brane pair ([Sen 98](#Sen98)). 

This conjectured process is one motivations for the further [[conjecture]] that [[D-brane charge]] is [[Dirac charge quantization|charge quantized]] in [[topological K-theory]] ([Witten 98, Section 3](D-brane#Witten98)), since this decay plausibly implements on the D-branes's [[Chan-Paton gauge field|Chan-Paton]] [[vector bundles]] the defining [[equivalence relation]] ([here](topological+K-theory#eq:DefiningEquivalenceRelation)) of [[topological K-theory]].
