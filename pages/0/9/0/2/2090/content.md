The boundary between [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[logic|logical]] foundational studies of mathematics is very unclear indeed -- one has only to think of Russell's part in _Principia Mathematica_. For a discussion of more obviously logical foundational aspects of category theory see [[foundations]].

## Foundations and the philosophy of language in mathematics

Different foundations of mathematics provide different languages to use for presenting concepts in mathematics, and the symbols and words used in various foundations have different [[meaning|meanings]] from each other. 

We work in a [[deductive system]] with hypothetical [[judgments]], and give examples of how different foundations of mathematics written in [[natural deduction]] result in different meanings of symbols used in the judgments used in each foundation. 

For example, take the symbol $\in$ denoting membership in [[set theory]] and [[set-level type theory|set-level]] [[dependent type theories]]. In [[unsorted set theory]] and [[simply sorted set theory]], $\in$ is a proposition in the context of an element variable and a set variable. The formal judgment $a \in A \; \mathrm{prop}$ means that "'the element $a$ is in the set $A$' is a proposition", and the judgment $a \in A \; \mathrm{true}$ is commonly abbreviated as $a \in A$ and means that "the proposition that the element $a$ is in the set $A$ is true". In [[dependently sorted set theory]], and in [[layered type theory|unlayered]] [[set-level type theory|set-level]] [[dependent type theories]], $\in$ is a metatheoretic [[judgment]], rather than being part of the actual structure of the theory. The formal judgment $a \in A$ simply means that "$a$ is in the set $A$", rather than "the proposition that the element $a$ is in the set $A$ is true"; there is no propositional truth value attached to $a \in A$. Thus, the foundational notion of membership in unsorted and simply sorted set theories is semantically different from the notion of membership in dependently sorted set theories and unlayered set-level dependent type theory. 

Similarly, the symbol $=$ denoting [[equality]] have different meanings in different theories.
