
__Semiotics__ is a general science about systems of signs, e.g. within culture, law, [[linguistics]] etc. It is closely related to [[semantics]] because a sign involves a correspondence between its form/expression (signifying) and its external pointer/meaning (signified). It also studies mechanisms how these semiotic systems appear, develop and disappear in real world (e.g. in communities).
