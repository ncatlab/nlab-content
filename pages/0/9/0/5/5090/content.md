##The Knot Group of  Knot##
The **knot group**, $G(K)$, of a knot $K$ is the [[fundamental group]] of the complement of the knot.  Taking this apart the knot $K$ is an embedding of $S^1$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $S^3$. We tend to abuse terminology and to think (and write) of $K$ as  the image of the embedding rather than the embedding itself, we can therefore write $\mathbf{R}^3-K$ for the space outside the knot, i.e. its complement.  This is clearly arcwise connected so we do not need to worry about a choice of base point any point will do.  We make the

$G(K) := \pi_1(\mathbf{R}^3-K)$.

This is fine, but does not tell us how to calculate anything about this group for a given knot. Luckily there are two neat algorithms for giving presentations of $G(K)$ for arbitrary knots, one due to Wirtinger the other to Alexander.
