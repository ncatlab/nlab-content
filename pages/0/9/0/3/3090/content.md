A **Serre fibration** is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological space]]s that has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions of the form $i : \Delta_n \hookrightarrow \Delta_n \times I$ that include the standard $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta_n$ as $\Delta_n \times \{0\}$.  

This is a special case of [[Hurewicz fibration]].
