#Definition#

An **orthogonal factorization system** can be defined as a [[weak factorization system]] in which solutions to lifting problems are unique.  It can also be defined more directly as a pair $(E,M)$ of classes of maps in a category $C$ such that

* Every morphism in $C$ factors as an $E$-morphism followed by an $M$-morphism, and
* Every morphism in $E$ is [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to every morphism in $M$.

OFS's are traditionally called just **factorization systems**.  Our use of the adjective "orthogonal" is to avoid the [[red herring principle]] when comparing with [[weak factorization system]]s.
