The [[smash product]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological space]]s generalizes to [[spectrum|spectra]].

Equipped with the smash product operation the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] becomes a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]].

There is a version of the smash product of spectra that is strictly associative and strictly commutative: the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

the $(\infty,1)$-categorical description is in section 4.2 of
