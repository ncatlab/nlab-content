##Â Idea

A [[subset]] of a [[metric space]] canonically inherits a [[metric]] by restriction. This is called the _induced metric_.

The corresponding [[metric topology]] is the [[subspace topology]].

## Examples

* The [[Euclidean metric]] on an [[Archimedean ordered field]] is an induced metric. Every Archimedean ordered field is an [[ordered field|ordered]] [[subfield]] of the [[Dedekind real numbers]] and thus inherits the Euclidean metric of the Dedekind real numbers. 

* The [[Euclidean metric]] on a real [[interval]] is an induced metric, since real intervals are subsets of the Dedekind real numbers.
