## Idea

[[Isaac Newton]] formulated three law of [[mechanics]] (today called "[[classical mechanics]]") whose statement constitutes the beginning of [[physics]] as a science rooted in [[mathematics]], in contrast to the more naively descriptive "[[natural philosophy]]".

## Statement

In modern formulation, Newton's three laws express the following:

### Newton's first and second law

The first and second law together says that [[equations of motion]] in [[physics]] are given by [[differential equations]] of _second_ order.

This implies that initial value data for [[equations of motion]] is given by 0th and by 1st [[derivatives]]. This data is in physics traditionally is referred to as _[[canonical coordinates]]_ and _[[canonical momenta]]_, respectively. In modern mathematical physics this is axiomatized by the notion of [[phase space]] being a [[symplectic manifold]].

### Newton's third law

The third Law expresses an invariance under the [[equations of motion]] under the [[Galilei group]].

  With the advent of the "[[theory of special relativity]]" this law was later refined to postulate invariance under the [[Poincaré group]]. With the advent of the [[theory of general relativity]] it was further refined to postulate only [[local symmetry]] under the [[Poincaré group]], which leads to the modern formulation of [[Einstein gravity]].
