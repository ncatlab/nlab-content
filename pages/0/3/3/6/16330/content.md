## Idea

Originally, "*simple type theory*" was the name of the [[type theory]] introduced by [Church (1940)](#Church40) (therefore often and more informatively: "*Church's type theory*" or similar). This [[type theory]] allowed (only) [[function type]]-[[type formation]] (therefore often: "simply typed [[lambda-calculus]]") based on two elementary types (a kind of [[type of natural numbers]] and a [[type of propositions]]).

In mild generalization, if one admits in addition [[product type]]-[[type formation]] then &lbrack;e.g. [Gunter (1992)](#Gunter92)&rbrack; these are the type theories whose [[categorical semantics]] is in [[cartesian closed categories]] &lbrack;[Lambek & Scott (1986), Part I](#LambekScott86)&rbrack;, see also at *[[relation between category theory and type theory]]*.

More generally, the term "simple type theory" has come to refer to any [[type theory]] whose [[type formations]] are *not indexed*, in that the [[judgment]] that a [[type]] $A$ is well-formed has no other inputs, understood *in contrast* to:

* [[polymorphism|polymorphic type theory]], where types depend on a [[context]] of type variables, 

* [[dependent type theory]], where types depend on a [[context]] of more general variables.
