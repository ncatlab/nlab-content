The composite of [[Schur functors]] is again a Schur functor.  The process of composing Schur functors is known as **plethysm**, especially in situations where we want an explicit "formula" for how the Schur functors compose.

For example, the $n^{th}$ [[exterior power]] functor $\Lambda^n$ is a Schur functor, as is the $n^{th}$ [[symmetric power]] functor $S^n$.  So, we might want to describe the composite

$$  V \mapsto \Lambda^2 S^2(V) $$

as a direct sum of Schur functors coming from [[Young diagrams]].    And, this is the sort of problem people study when they talk about "plethysm".

In Richard P. Stanley's book _Enumerative Combinatorics_, he discusses the origin of the term 'plethysm' in Volume 2, Appendix 2.  He says that the term was introduced in 

* D. E.  Littlewood, Invariant theory, tensors and group characters, _Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London. Ser. A._ **239**, (1944), 305--365.

The term "plethysm" was suggested to Littlewood by M. L. Clark after the Greek word _plethysmos_, or &#960;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#957;&#963;&#956;o&#950;, meaning "multiplication".  (The Greek is approximate here.)
