The composite of [[Schur functors]] is again a Schur functor.  The process of composing Schur functors is known as **plethysm**, especially in situations where we want an explicit "formula" for how the Schur functors compose.

For example, the $n^{th}$ [[exterior power]] functor $\Lambda^n$ is a Schur functor, as is the $n^{th}$ [[symmetric power]] functor $S^n$.  So, we might want to describe the composite

$$  V \mapsto \Lambda^2 S^2(V) $$

as a direct sum of Schur functors coming from [[Young diagrams]].    And, this is the sort of problem people study when they talk about "plethysm".
