## Idea
 {#Idea}

Following the general concept of *[[(n,r)-category|$(n,r)$-category]]*, a *$(0,1)$-category* is a [[category]] whose [[hom-objects]] are [[(-1)-groupoids]], hence which for every [[pair]] of [[objects]] $a,b$ have either no morphism $a \to b$ or an [[essentially unique]] one.

More in detail, recall that:

* an [[(n,1)-category]] is an [[(∞,1)-category]] such that every [[hom-space|hom ∞-groupoid]] is [[n-truncated|(n-1)-truncated]].

* a [[0-truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]] is equivalently a set;

* a [[(-1)-truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]] is either [[contractible]] or [[empty set|empty]].

Therefore:

###### Remark
**([[relation between preorders and (0,1)-categories]])**
\linebreak
An $(0,1)$-category is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] a [[proset]] ([[relation between preorders and (0,1)-categories|hence]] a [[poset]]).

We may without restriction assume that every hom-$\infty$-groupoid is just a set. Then since this is [[(-1)-truncated]] it is either empty or the singleton. So there is at most one morphism from any object to any other.

## Extra stuff, structure, property

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[site]] is a [[(0,1)-site]]: a [[posite]].

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[topos]] is a [[(0,1)-topos]]: a [[Heyting algebra]].

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[Grothendieck topos]] is a [[Grothendieck (0,1)-topos]]: a [[frame]] or [[locale]].

* A $(0,1)$-category which is also a [[groupoid]] (that is, every morphism is an isomorphism) is a $(0,0)$-category (which may think of as either a $0$-category or as a $0$-groupoid), which is the same as a [[set]] (up to equivalence) or a [[setoid]] (up to isomorphism).
