## Idea

A **Tambara-Yamagami** (TY) category is a [[fusion category]] that may be regarded as a non-trivial extension of a category of $G$-[[graded vector spaces]], for $G$ a [[finite group]]. By nontrivial extension we mean that, even though it is constructed from a category of $G$-graded vector spaces, it itself cannot be presented as such. 

In 2-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), a TY category is thought to encode as a *symmetry category* what is nowadays known as a [[non-invertible symmetry]], where the [[objects]] of the category correspond to line [[defects]]. 

## Definition 

A Tambara-Yamagami category $TY(G)$ is defined as follows. 

Starting from a [[finite group]] $G$, consider the set $I=G\coprod \{m\}$. We construct $TY(G)$ by defining the simple objects as $\{U_g\}_{g\in G}\coprod \{U_m\}$. These have fusion rules:

* $U_{g}\otimes U_{g'}=U_{gg'}$
* $U_{g}\otimes U_m = U_m$
* $U_m\otimes U_g = U_m$
* $U_m\otimes U_m = \sum_{g\in G} U_g$

Unless stated otherwise, we assume the ground field of $TY(G)$ to be $\mathbb{C}$. It has been shown that the above fusion rules also admit categorification over the reals (see [Plavnik & Sanford & Sconce 2023](#PlavnikSanfordSconce2023)).

## Properties

It was shown by [Tambara & Yamagami (1998)] (#Tambara1998tensor) that these categories are classified by pairs $(\chi,\tau)$ for $\chi:G\times G\to \mathbb{C}^*$ a bicharacter, and $\tau$ a square root of $\frac{1}{|G|}$.

###### Remark
Since $\chi$ is symmetric and nondegenerate, $TY(G)$ exists only if $G$ is abelian. $TY(G)$ is not necessarily unique for a choice of $G$.

###### Proposition
$TY(G)$ is a [unitary fusion category](unitary+fusion+category).
=--

This follows from ([Galindo & Hong & Rowell 2013, theorem 5.20](#GalindoHongRowell2013)).

###### Proposition
$TY(G)$ is a braided fusion category if and only if $G\cong\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$.
=--

The above is due to ([Siehler 2000, theorem 1.2(1)](#Siehler2000)).

## Examples

* $TY(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ is realised by two distinct unitary fusion categories (distinguished by the Frobenius-Schur indicator $\varkappa_{m}\in\{+1,-1\}$ of $m$), each of which admit $4$ distinct braidings. All $8$ of these unitary braided fusion categories (UBFCs) are [modular](modular+tensor+category). In particular, the $4$ UBFCs with $\varkappa_{m}=+1$ are also known as the Ising categories (which describe [$SU(2)$-anyons](su2-anyon) at level $k=2$).

* As worked out in [Tambara & Yamagami (1998)](#Tambara1998tensor), for $TY(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2)$, there are two possible choices of roots ($\tau=\pm\frac{1}{2}$), and two choices of classes of bicharacters. For $\tau=\frac{1}{2}$ and trivial bicharacter, $TY$ is the [[category of representations]] of the [[dihedral group]] $D_8$. For $\tau=-\frac{1}{2}$ and trivial character, this is the representation category of the [[quaternion group]] $Q_8$. For $\tau=\frac{1}{2}$ and nontrivial character, this is the representation category of the Kac-Paljutkin 8-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]]. The remaining choice does not correspond to the category of representations of a Hopf algebra (see also [[Tannaka duality]]).
