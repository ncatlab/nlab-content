There is just one __$(-1)$-poset__, namely the [[point]].  Compare the concepts of $0$-[[0-poset|poset]] (a [[truth value]]) and $1$-[[1-poset|poset]] (a [[partial order|poset]]).  Compare also with $(-2)$-[[(-2)-category|category]] and $(-2)$-[[(-2)-groupoid|groupoid]], which mean the same thing for their own reasons.

The point of $(-1)$-posets is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table]]s and complete the general concept of $n$-[[n-poset|poset]].  For example, there should be a $0$-[[0-poset|poset]] $(-1)\Pos$ of $(-1)$-posets; a $0$-poset is simply a truth value, and $(-1)\Pos$ is the [[true]] truth value.

As a category, $(-1)\Pos$ is a [[monoidal category]] in a unique way, and a [[enriched category|category enriched]] over this should be (at least up to equivalence) a $0$-poset, which is a truth value; and indeed, a category enriched over $(-1)\Pos$ is a category in which any two objects are isomorphic in a unique way, which is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a truth value.

See [[(-1)-category]] for references on this sort of [[negative thinking]].
