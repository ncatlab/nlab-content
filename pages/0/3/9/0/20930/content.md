## Idea

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $(\mathfrak{g}, [-,-])$ and a [[Lie algebra representation]] $\mathfrak{g} \otimes V \overset{\rho}{\to} V$, and given non-degenerate [[inner products]], hence "metrics", both on $\mathfrak{g}$ and on $V$, one may ask that all [[mathematical structure|structure]] is compatible with these metrics. For the Lie algebra this means to have a _[[metric Lie algebra]]_ and for the representation this means to have an [[orthogonal Lie algebra|orthogonal]] representation. Hence together this is an  _orthogonal representation of a metric Lie algebra_, or _metric Lie representation_, for short.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

The following table shows the data in a metric Lie representation equivalently

1. in [[category theory]]-notation;

1. in [[Penrose notation]] ([[string diagrams]]);

1. in index notation:

## Properties

### Structures induced from metric Lie representations

The following [[mathematical structures]] are induced from the data of metric Lie representations:

* [[Lie algebra weight systems]] on ([[horizontal chord diagram|horizontal]]) [[chord diagrams]];

* [[M2-brane 3-algebras]] (the [[Faulkner construction]]);

* ...
