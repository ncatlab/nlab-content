[[!redirects center of an abelian category]]

The __center of an [[additive category]]__ $A$ is the [[endomorphism ring]] of the [[identity functor]] $Id_A$ (cf. with [[center]]). 

In general, the center is not functorial, but it is functorial in some important special circumstances, like some reconstruction theorems in the commutative setup.  (It is also functorial on [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]].)

An early occurence of the definition of the center of an additive category is in section 5.d of
