In classical mathematics, a **field** is a commutative [[ring]] in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse and $0\neq 1$.

Fields are not as well-behaved categorically as most other common algebraic structures ([[group]]s, [[ring]]s, [[module]]s, etc.).  In particular, the category of fields is not [[complete category|complete]] or [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], although it is [[accessible category|accessible]].

For the same reason, in [[constructivism|constructive mathematics]] (such as the [[internal logic]] of a topos) there are different inequivalent ways to define a field.  In this case the above definition is not usually the best one; for instance, the real numbers do not satisfy it.

### Discussion ###

There is a discussion about fields at [[vector space]] which should perhaps be moved here and summarized.
