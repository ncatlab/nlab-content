## Idea

The analogue of a [[sober topological space]] for [[sigma-topological space|$\sigma$-topological spaces]]. 

## Definition

A [[sigma-topological space|$\sigma$-topological space]] $X$ is **sober** if its [[points]] are exactly determined by its [[lattice of open subsets]].  Different equivalent ways to say this are:

* The [[continuous map]] from $X$ to the space of points of the [[sigma-locale|$\sigma$-locale]] that it gives rise to (see there for details) is a [[homeomorphism]].

* The [[function]] from points of $X$ to the _[[countably prime filter|countably prime filters]]_ of its open-set lattice is a [[bijection]].
