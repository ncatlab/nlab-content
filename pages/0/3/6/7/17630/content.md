## Idea
A monster for a first-order theory $T$ is a sort of "equivariant Grothendieck universe" for the definable sets of that theory. The notion generalizes that of Weil's universal domain (which are just monster models of the theory [[theory of algebraically closed fields|ACF]] of algebraically closed fields.)

## Definition
The most important aspects of monster models are _saturation_ and _homogeneity_: all types over parameter sets of a certain size are realized, and all elementary embeddings of subsets can be extended to automorphisms. Most commonly the monster is assumed to be the size of an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$, with saturation over all parameter sets less than $\kappa$.
## Examples
Monster models in general tend to be hard to explicitly describe, except when theories are "well-behaved", e.g. stable (when type spaces don't blow up) or $\kappa$-categorical for some uncountable $\kappa$ (when the number of isomorphism classes of models in a certain cardinality is $1$). For example, both are true for $\mathsf{ACF}$.

By a back-and-forth argument (e.g. the one used by Cantor to prove the uniqueness of the countable dense linear order without endpoints), one can show that any two monster models are well-defined up to isomorphism, up to cardinality.
