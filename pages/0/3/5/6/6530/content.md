This is not part of [[philosophy]] in a narrow sense, but the opinions on what is good [[mathematics]], how mathematics could develop better, and how it should be stimulated to develop, as well as overviews of the current state of mathematics and its important points, is an important part of reflection, but also of the practical action of a mathematician.


## On the relation between conjectural and proved mathematics styles

This is a topic of a well-known discussion series in 1990s.
