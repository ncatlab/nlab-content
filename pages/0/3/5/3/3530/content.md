## Idea

**Crystalline cohomology** is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to the _[[crystalline site]]_ of a [[scheme]]. Hence, put more generally, it is the [[cohomology]] of [[de Rham spaces]]/[[coreduced objects]].

Crystalline cohomology serves to refine the notion of [[de Rham cohomology]] for [[schemes]].

Crystalline cohomology is in particular a [[Weil cohomology]] and is generalized by the notion of [[rigid cohomology]].

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[scheme]] overy a base $S$. The **[[crystalline site]]** $Cris(X/S)$ of $X$ is

* the [[category]] whose objects are all nilpotent $S$-immersions $U \hookrightarrow T$, where $U$ is an open set of $X$ and and the ideal on $T$ defining this immersion being endowed with a nilpotent divided power structure (...details...).;

* the [[Grothendieck topology]] on this category is the Zariski topology.

If $S$ is of characteristic 0, then $Cris(X/S)$ coincides with the **infinitesimal site** of $X$. (...details...).

## Properties

### Relation to de Rham space

Crystalline cohomology of $X$ is the [[cohomology]] of the [[de Rham space]]
of $X$. See there for more. 

### Relation to differential homotopy type theory

In [[differential homotopy type theory]] the [[infinitesimal flat modality]]
sends [[coefficients]] to coefficients for crystalline cohomology.

## Relateed concepts

* [[p-adic cohomology]]

The [[comparison theorem (crystalline cohomology)]] shown there (theorem V2.3.2) shows that the crystalline cohomology over $\mathbb{Z}/p$ is canonically identified with the [[de Rham cohomology]] of a lift to [[p-adic geometry]] if one exists. See also
