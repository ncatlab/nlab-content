## Idea

In [[number theory]], an **odious number** is a [[natural number]] that has an odd number of ones in its binary [[radix expansion]]. 

The term "odious number" was chosen by the authors of [Berlekamp, Conway, & Guy](#BCG01) because the two first letters of "odious" were the same as that of "[[odd number]]".
