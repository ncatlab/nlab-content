I was a PhD student of Frank Peterson at MIT in the 1980's.

I've been a professor at Swarthmore College since 1991, emeritus starting in Fall 2024.

In Spring semester 2024 I taught an introduction to category theory for undergraduates (a mix of mathematics, physics and computer science majors).  I am working on writing up my notes for that course.
