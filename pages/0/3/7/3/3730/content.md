## Idea

The most basic form of the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence states that the [[category]] of [[flat connection|flat]] [[vector bundles]] on a suitable [[space]] is equivalent to the category of [[local systems]].


While [[Riemann-Hilbert problem|Hilbert's 21st problem]] has a negative solution, there is a generalized sheaf-theoretical formulation which leads to an equivalence of categories discovered by Mebkhout and a bit later also by [[Kashiwara]].
