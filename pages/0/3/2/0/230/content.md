I am a mathematician specializing in category theory. My PhD was completed in 1994 under the direction of Myles Tierney, and centered on categorical coherence problems and their relation to categorical logic. Subsequently I spent a few years in Sydney working with Ross Street, mainly on higher-dimensional categories, and then a few years in Chicago; the Chicago category seminar was founded during my stay. 

Since 2001 I have been a full-time parent; I presently live in Connecticut and continue to do mathematics as time allows. Among other things I actively participate in the n-Category Caf&#233; blog, and I coauthor the mathematics blog topologicalmusings.wordpress.com.
