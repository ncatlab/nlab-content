I am a mathematician specializing in category theory. My PhD was completed in 1994 under the direction of Myles Tierney, and centered on categorical coherence problems and their relation to categorical logic. Subsequently I spent a few years in Sydney working with Ross Street, mainly on higher-dimensional categories, and then spent a few years in Chicago; the Chicago category seminar at the University of Chicago was founded during my stay. 

Since 2001 I have been a full-time parent; I presently live in Connecticut and continue to do mathematics as time allows. Among other things I actively participate in the [$n$-Category Caf&#233;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) blog, and I coauthor the mathematics blog [Topological Musings](http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com). Since late 2013 I have also been a moderator at [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions). 

A few of my older scribblings can be found [here](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/trimble); some more recent ones are at my nLab web [here](https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/HomePage).
