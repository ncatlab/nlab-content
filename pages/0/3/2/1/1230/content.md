[[Zoran Skoda]]: I like the expansion (by Mike I guess) which is now in the entry n-fibration, it is instructive and a strong novelty of the nlab (is there more to read on the weak case somewhere?). However, I would prefer that for the case of STRICT n-categories, for which I intended the fibered n category entry when I created it; that we keep the original name and original definition (thus talking about n-cartesian
cells, regardless that it is evil, and one should expand on that). Grothendieck, Gabriel and Gray discovered fibered (strict) 1- and 2- categories and called them fibered 1- or 2-categories; Hermida generlized to strict n and Bunge is following , also uinder the same name: so let us keep the explicit version for the strict n-categories under the name fibered n category and with "evil" definition (which is very useful in my practice, at least for n=2); and lets us keep homotopically-biased title n-fibration for the weak n-catgeory version. Of course, no hurry, in due time...And also having an entry fibered 2-category for the case of strict 2-categories where hermida has two different but equivalent definitions. Does that make sense to you ? Mike, Toby, Urs ?

[[Toby Bartels]]:  If these are useful to you, then we should certainly have an article on them.  But can we put it at [[strict fibered n-category]]? (or [[fibered strict n-category]] if you don\'t want to imply that there\'s anything strict about how the strict $n$-category is fibred).  Besides the hyphen (which is a technicality), one of the biases of the $n$-Lab is that the default notion of $n$-category is weak.  Of course, people who work with strict $n$-categories don\'t share that bias, so we won\'t quite match their language.
