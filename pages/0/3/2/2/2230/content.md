## Idea

In [[group theory]], by the "*holomorph*" $Hol(G)$ of a ([[discrete group|discrete]]) [[group]] $G$ one means the [[group]] [[isomorphism|equivalently]] described in any of the following ways:

* the smallest group $Hol(G)$ containing $G$ as a [[subgroup]]  $\iota \colon G \hookrightarrow Hol(G)$ such that every [[automorphism]] of $G$ appears as an [[inner automorphism]] of $Hol(G)$ [[restriction|restricted]] along $\iota$,

* the [[normalizer]] $N_{Sym(G)}(G)$ of $G$ regarded as a [[subgroup]] (via its [[regular representation]]) of the [[symmetric group]] $Sym(G)$ on (i.e. the [[automorphism group]] of) its [[underlying set]],

* the [[semidirect product group]] $G \rtimes Aut(G)$ of $G$ with its [[automorphism group]] (via the defining [[group action]] of $Aut(G)$ on $G$),

* the group $Mor\big(Aut(\mathbf{B} G)\big)$ of [[morphisms]] in the [[automorphism 2-group]] of $G$, regarded as the [[strict 2-group]] corresponding to the [[crossed module]] $G \xrightarrow{ad} Aut(G)$, where "$ad$" is the [[adjoint action]] of $G$ on itself (i.e. by [[inner automorphisms]]).
