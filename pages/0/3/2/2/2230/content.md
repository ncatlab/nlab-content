One would like to embed an abstract [[group]] into a bigger group $K$ in which every [[automorphism]] of $G$ is obtained by restricting (to $G$) an [[inner automorphism]] of $K$ that fixes $G$ as a subset of $K$.  The holomorph is the universal (smalles) solution to this problem.

Each group $G$ embeds into the symmetric group $Sym(G)$ on the [[underlying set]] of $G$ by the left [[regular representation]] $g\mapsto l_g$ where $l_g(h) = g h$. The [[image]] is isomorphic to $G$ (that is, the left regular representation of a discrete group is [[faithful representation|faithful]]). The [[normalizer]] of the image of $G$ in $Sym(G)$ is called the __holomorph__.

The holomorph occurs very naturally as the group of arrows of the [[2-group]] (groupoid internal to $Groups$).
