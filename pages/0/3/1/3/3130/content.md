## Idea
 {#Idea}

Traditionally, in the strict sense of the term, the _Chern character_ is a [[universal characteristic class]] of [[vector bundles]] or equivalently of their [[topological K-theory]] classes, which is a [[rational number|rational]] combination of all [[Chern classes]].

This is a special case of the following more general construction ([[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology,and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 02, section 4.8]]):

for $E$ a [[spectrum]] [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] there is a canonical [[localization of spectra|localization]] map

$$
  ch_E \;\colon\; E \longrightarrow E \wedge H\mathbb{R}
$$

to the [[smash product]] with the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] over the [[real numbers]]. This represents the $E$-Chern character (see also [Bunke-Gepner 13, around def. 2.1](#BunkeGepner13)).

In the case that $E = $ [[KU]] this reproduces the traditional Chern character. (In which case this is a map from a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] of [[chromatic level]] 1 to chromatic level 0. More generally one can also consider [[higher chromatic Chern characters]] that take values not in [[ordinary cohomology]] but in some cohomology theory of higher [[chromatic level]]. See at _[[higher chromatic Chern character]]_ for more on this.)

The Chern character $ch_E$ may be used to define [[differential cohomology]] refinements $\hat E$ of the [[cohomology theory]] $E$ by choosing a [[differential form]]-model for $E \wedge H\mathbb{R}$ ([Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02), see also at _[[differential function complex]]_). In that case $ch_E$ is the [[real cohomology]] class associated to a _chern character differential form_ $CH_E$ via the [[de Rham theorem]]. Here $CH_E$ has the interpretation of being the [[curvature forms]] of the [[differential cohomology]] [[cocycles]] thought of as [[connection on a principal ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].

This may be turned around ([Bunke-Nikolaus-V&#246;lkl 13, prop. .3.5](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)): given any refinement $\hat E$ of $E$ in a [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $T \mathbf{H}$, then it is induced from homotopy pullback of its [de Rham coefficients](cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos+--+structures#deRhamCohomology) along a Chern character map 

$$
  ch_E = \Pi \theta_{\hat E} \;\colon\; E \simeq \Pi(\hat E) \longrightarrow \Pi \flat_{dR} \hat E
  \,,
$$

where $\Pi$ is the [[shape modality]] and $\theta_E$ the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] of $E$. This reproduces the above definition for ordinary differential form models, see at _[differential cohomology diagram -- Hopkins-Singer coefficients](#differential+cohomology+diagram#HopkinsSingerCoefficients)_. 

But more generally, given for instance a [[K(n)-local spectrum|K(n)-localization]] $E \longrightarrow L_{K(n)} E$ then any choice of [[cohesion|cohesive]] refinement of $L_{K(n)} E$ (i.e. lift through the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the [[shape modality]] $\Pi$) which is in the kernel of $\flat$ yields a generalized differential cohomology theory $\hat E$ whose intrinsic Chern-character $\Pi \theta_{\hat E}$ is the $K(n)$-localization. See at _[differential cohomology diagram -- Chern character and differential fracture](differential+cohomology+diagram#ChernCharacterAndFractureSquares)_.

In words this is summarized succintly as: _The Chern character is the [[shape modality|shape]] of the [[Maurer-Cartan form]]._

In the context of [[algebraic K-theory]] Chern characters appear at _[[Beilinson regulators]]_.
There are analogues in algebraic geometry (e.g. a Chern character between [[Chow groups]] and [[algebraic K-theory]]) and in [[noncommutative geometry]] (Chern-Connes character) where the role of usual cohomology is taken by some variant of cyclic cohomology.  

## Examples

### For vector bundles and topological K-theory 
 {#KTheory}

The classical theory of the Chern character applies to the [[spectrum]] of complex [[K-theory]], $E = KU$. In this case, the Chern character is made up from Chern classes: each characteristic class is by Chern-Weil theory in  the image of a certain element in the Weil algebra via taking the class of evaluation at the [[curvature]] operator for some choice of a connection. Consider the symmetric functions in $n$ variables $t_1,\ldots, t_n$ and let the Chern classes of a complex vector bundle $\xi$ (representing a complex K-theory class) be $c_1,\ldots, c_n$. Define the formal power series 

$$
\phi = \phi^n(t_1,\ldots, t_n) = e^{t_1}+\ldots+e^{t_n}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} (t_1^k+\ldots+t_n^k)
$$

Then $ch(\chi) = \phi(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$. 

Let us describe this a bit differently. The cocycle $H^0(X,KU)$ may be represented by a complex [[vector bundle]], and the image of this cocycle under the Chern-character is the class in even-graded real cohomology that is represented (under the [[deRham theorem]] isomorphism of deRham cohomology with real cohomology) by the even graded closed [[differential form]]


$$
 ch(\nabla) \coloeqq \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}}
   k_j
   tr( F_\nabla \wedge \cdots \wedge F_\nabla)
  \;\;
  \in \Omega^{2 \bullet}(X)
  \,,
$$

where

* $\nabla$ is any chosen [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the vector bundle;

* $F = F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(V))$ is the [[curvature]] of this connection;

* $k_j \in \mathbb{R}$ are normalization constants, $k_j = \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^j$;

* the trace of the wedge products produces the [[curvature characteristic form]]s.

The Chern character applied to the [[Whitney sum]] of two vector bundles is a sum of the Chern characters for the two: $ch(\xi\oplus \eta) = ch(\chi)+ch(\eta)$ and it is multiplicative under the tensor product of vector bundles: $ch(\xi\otimes\eta)=ch(\chi)ch(\eta)$. Therefore we get a ring homomorphism. 


### For spectra and generalized cohomology theories
 {#ForSpectraAndGeneralizedCohomology}

For $E$ a [[spectrum]] and $E^\bullet$ the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory|generalized cohomology theory]] it [[Brown representability theorem|represents]]

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \;\simeq\; \pi_{-\bullet} Maps(X,E)
$$

the _[[Chern-Dold character]] for $E$_ ([Buchstaber 70](#Buchstaber70)) is the map induced by [[rationalization]] over the [[real numbers]]

$$
  E \overset{L_{\mathbb{R}}}{\longrightarrow} E_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

i.e. is

\[
  \label{ChernDoldCharacter}
  chd
  \;\colon\;
  E^\bullet(X)
  \;\simeq\;
  \pi_{-\bullet}Maps(X,E)
  \overset{
    \pi_{-\bullet}Maps(X,L_{\mathbb{R}})
  }{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{-\bullet}Maps(X,E_{\mathbb{R}})
  \;\simeq\;
  E^\bullet_{\mathbb{E}}(X)
  \;\simeq\;
  H^\bullet(X, \pi_{\bullet}(E)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{R})
  \,.
\]

The very last equivalence in (eq:ChernDoldCharacter) is due to [Dold 56, Cor. 4](#Dold56) (reviewed in detail in [Rudyak 98, II.3.17](#Rudyak98), see also  [Gross 19, Def. 2.5](#Gross19)).

One place where this neat state of affairs (eq:ChernDoldCharacter) is made fully explicit is [Lind-Sati-Westerland 16, Def. 2.1](#LindSatiWesterland16). Many other references leave this statement somewhat in between the lines (e.g. [Buchstaber 70](#Buchstaber70), [Upmeier 14](#Upmeier14)) and, in addition, often without reference to Dold (e.g. [Hopkins-Singer 02, Sec. 4.8](#HopkinsSinger02), [Bunke 12, Def. 4.45](#Bunke12), [Bunke-Gepner 13, Def. 2.1](#BunkeGepner13), [Bunke-Nikolaus 14, p. 17](#BunkeNikolaus14)).

Beware that some authors say _Chern-Dold character_ for the full map in (eq:ChernDoldCharacter) (e.g. 
[Buchstaber 70](#Buchstaber70), 
[Upmeier 14](#Upmeier14), [Lind-Sati-Westerland 16, Def. 2.1](#LindSatiWesterland16)), while other authors mean by this only that last equivalence in (eq:ChernDoldCharacter) (e.g. [Rudyak 98, II.3.17](#Rudyak98), [Gross 19, Def. 2.5](#Gross19)).

Examples of Chern-Dold characters: 

* [[Chern character]] on [[KU]];

* [[Pontrjagin character]] on [[KO]].

### For cohesive stable homotopy types

More generally, for $\hat E$ a [[stable homotopy type]] in a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]], then the underlying bare homotopy type is $E \coloneqq \Pi(\hat E)$ and the corresponding Chern character is

$$
  ch \coloneqq \Pi \theta_{\hat E} \;\colon\; E \simeq \Pi(\hat E) \longrightarrow \Pi \flat_{dR} \hat E
  \,.
$$

For more on this see at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_.

### In terms of cyclic homology

Generalizing in another direction, generalized Chern characters are given by passage to [[derived loop spaces]] and their [[cyclic homology]] or, more generally,  [[topological cyclic homology]] ([Toen-Vezzosi 08](#ToenVezzosi08), [Hoyois-Scherotzke-Sibilla 15](#HoyoisScherotzkeSibilla15)).

## Properties

### Push-forward and Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem

The behaviour of the Chern-character under [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] along [[proper maps]] is described by the [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]].
