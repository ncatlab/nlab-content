## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[(∞,1)-product]]s $\times$ which is a [[closed monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with respect to $\otimes := \times$ is called a **cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category.

## Examples

Every [[(∞,1)-topos]] is a cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category. See the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity%2C1)-topos#ClosedMonoidalStructure">Closed monoidal structure</a>.
