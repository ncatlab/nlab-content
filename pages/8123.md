Let $F \colon C \to D$ be a [[functor]], and suppose a collection of objects $\{c_i\}$ in $C$ admits a [[product]], with projections 

$$\pi_i \colon \prod_i c_i \to c_i.$$ 

We say $F$ [[preserved limit|preserves]] this product if the collection of maps 

$$F(\pi_i): F(\prod_i c_i) \to F(c_i)$$ 

exhibits $F(\prod_i c_i)$ as a product of the collection of objects $F(c_i)$. 

If $C$ has all (small) products, $F$ is _product-preserving_ if it preserves every product in $C$.
