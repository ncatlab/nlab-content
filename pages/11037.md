## Idea

The _cut rule_ in [[sequent calculus]] ([[formal logic]]) is the rule that from [[sequents]] of the form

$$
  \Gamma \vdash A , \Delta
$$

and

$$
  \Pi, A \vdash \Lambda
$$

the new sequent

$$
  \Gamma, \Pi \vdash \Delta, \Lambda
$$

may be [[deduction|deduced]]. 

In the [[categorical semantics]] where each [[sequent]] here is interpreted as a [[morphism]] in a [[category]], the cut rule asserts the existence of [[composition]] of morphisms.

The _cut-elimination theorem_ ("[[Gerhard Gentzen]]'s Hauptsatz") asserts that every [[judgement]] which has a [[proof]] using the cut-rule also has a proof not using it (a "cut-free proof").  While Gentzen\'s original theorem was for a few particular sequent calculi that he was considering, it is true of many other sequent calculi and is generally seen as desirable.  (That said, there are some useful sequent calculi in which it fails.)

In the analogy between the composition and the cut rule, the analogue of [[identity morphisms]] is the identity rule

$$
  A \vdash A
$$

Typically, a cut-elimination algorithm goes hand-in-hand with an algorithm which eliminates the identity rule, or rather which pushes back identities as far as possible, down to identities for basic propositional variables (so for example, $p \wedge q \vdash p \wedge q$ may be proved using $p \vdash p$ and $q \vdash q$, in addition to the rules for $\wedge$, but $p \vdash p$ itself must be adopted as an axiom). 

In fact, there is a sense in which elimination of cuts is seen as _dual_ to elimination of identities, analogous to the sense in which [[beta reduction]] is seen as dual to [[eta expansion]]. Very typically, a normalization scheme on terms first applies eta expansions are far as they will go, and then applies beta reductions as far as they will go, so as to at last reach a normal form. The same goes for rewrite systems on sequent deductions, which first eliminate identities, then eliminate cuts.
