## Idea

The _cut rule_ in [[sequent calculus]] ([[formal logic]]) is the rule that from [[sequents]] of the form

$$
  \Gamma \vdash A , \Delta
$$

and

$$
  \Pi, A \vdash \Lambda
$$

the new sequent

$$
  \Gamma, \Pi \vdash \Delta, \Lambda
$$

may be [[deduction|deduced]]. 

In the [[categorical semantics]] where each [[sequent]] here is interpreted as a [[morphism]] in a [[category]], the cut rule asserts the existence of [[composition]] of morphisms.

The _cut-elimination theorem_ ("[[Gerhard Gentzen]]'s Hauptsatz") asserts that every [[judgement]] which has a [[proof]] using the cut-rule also has a proof not using it (a "cut-free proof").
