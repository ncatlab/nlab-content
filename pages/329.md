#Idea

* A strict 2-category is a [[directed n-graph|directed 2-graph]] equipped with a composition operation on adjacent 1-cells and 2-cells which is strictly unital and associative.

* The concept of a strict 2-category is the simplest generalization of a [[category]] to a [[higher category theory|higher category]]. It is the one-step [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of the concept of a category.

#Definition

A _strict 2-category_, often called simply a _2-category_, is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] [[Cat]]. 

Similarly, a [[strict 2-groupoid]] is a groupoid enriched over groupoids. This is also called a [[geometric shapes for higher structures|globular]] strict 2-groupoid, to emphasise the underlying geometry. The category of strict 2-groupoids is eqivalent to the category  of [[crossed module]]s over groupoids. It is also equivalent to the category of (strict) double groupoids with connections. 

They are also special cases of strict globular omega-groupoids, and the category of these is equivalent to the category of [[crossed complex]]es. 



#Remarks

* A strict 2-category is the same as a [[strict omega-category]] which is trivial in degree $n \geq 3$.

* This is to be contrasted with a _weak 2-category_ called a [[bicategory]]. In a strict 2-category composition of 1-morphisms is strictly associative and comoposition with [[identity morphism]]s strictly satisfies the required identity law. In a weak 2-category these laws may hold only up to coherent 2-morphisms.
