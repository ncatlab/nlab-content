## Idea

The notions of _[[presheaf]]_, _[[site]]_ and _[[sheaf]]_ can be formulated [[internalization|internal]] to any [[topos]]. The ordinary such notions are recovered by internalization into [[Set]].

More precisely, the direct internalization of these notions is into the [[universe enlargement|very large]] [[2-topos]] of the given ambient topos $\mathcal{S}$, since an internal presheaf is to be an $\mathcal{S}$-valued internal functor, but $\mathcal{S}$ does not quite sit inside itself.



## Definition

For $\mathcal{S}$ a [[topos]] and $\mathbb{C}$ an [[internal category]] in $\mathcal{S}$, write $\bar \mathbb{C}$ for the [[2-sheaf]] on $\mathcal{S}$

$$
  \bar \mathbb{C} : \mathcal{S}^{op} \to Cat
$$

that it represents. Moreover write 

$$
  \bar \mathcal{S} : \mathcal{S}^{op} \to Cat
$$

for the [[2-sheaf]] that [[Grothendieck construction|classifies]] the [[codomain fibration]] of $\mathcal{S}$.

Then an **internal presheaf** on $\mathbb{C}$ is a morphism

$$
  F : \bar \mathbb{C}^{op} \to \bar \mathcal{S}
$$

of [[2-sheaves]] on $\mathcal{S}$. (An "[[indexed functor]]" between "[[indexed categories]]".)

Suppose moreover that $\mathbb{C}$ is equipped with the structure of an [[internal site]]. Then $F$ above is an **internal sheaf** on $\mathbb{C}$ if it satisfies the evident [[descent]] condition.

## References

Internal presheaves in a [[Grothendieck topos]] are discussed in Section V.7 of

* [[Sauders MacLane]], [[Ieke Moerdijk]], _[[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]_

and in section B2.3 of

* [[Peter Johnstone]], _[[Sketches of an Elephant]]_
 {#Johnstone}

In these references internal presheaves are introduced in components. The equivalence to the abstract reformulation in terms of morphisms between 2-sheaves follows for instance with ([Johnstone, lemma 2.3.13](#Johnstone)).
