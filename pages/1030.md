In a [[category]] $C$ with [[zero object]] $0$ the **zero morphism ** $0_{c,d} : c \to d$ between two objects $c, d \in C$ is the unique [[morphism]] that factors through $0$:
$$
  0_{c,d} : c \to 0 \to d
  \,.
$$
See [[zero object]] for examples.

More generally, in any category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[closed monoidal category]] of [[pointed set]]s (with [[smash product]]), the **zero morphism** $0_{c,d} : c \to d$ is the basepoint of the [[hom-object]] $[c,d]$.
