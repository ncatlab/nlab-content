## Idea

The classical notion of an [[internal category]] in a category with [[pullbacks]], can be generalized by replacing pullbacks with cotensor products in a [[monoidal category]]. 

## Definition

One typically starts with a monoidal category $M = (M, \otimes, 1)$ which is _regular_ in the sense that it has equalizers which are preserved by $\otimes$ on both sides. (The monoidal structure does _not_ need be symmetric.)

There is a [[bicategory]] $Comod(M)$ of [[comonoids]] and _bicomodules_ in $M$: this is a special case of the bicategory $Mod(K)$ of [[monads]] and [[module over a monad|bimodules]] in a bicategory $K$, where in this case $K = \mathbf{B} M^{op} = (\mathbf{B} M)^{co}$.  Then an **internal category in $M$** is a [[monad]] in $Comod(M)$.

There are two kind of morphisms of noncartesian internal categories: functors and cofunctors. 

...

## Examples

Because every [[set]] is canonically a comonoid with respect to the [[cartesian product]], a comonoid in [[Set]] is just a set and a bicomodule is a [[span]], and a monad in the bicategory of spans of sets is just a small category.  More generally, an internal category in the above sense in any category with [[finite products]] is just an [[internal category]] in the usual sense.

## References

The main historical reference is Marcelo Aguiar's 1997 Cornell thesis ([pdf](http://www.math.tamu.edu/~maguiar/thesis2.pdf)), under the guidance of S. Chase. [[George Janelidze]] calls such generalization **noncartesian internal category**, because if the tensor product is the cartesian the notion reduces to the traditional internal category.

[[David Roberts]]: I think Ross Street and the other Australian category theorists call this a quantum category - I did go to a talk once, but my notes are elsewhere.

[[David Roberts]]: It has been pointed out to me by Jeff Egger that this is incorrect, in that quantum categories as defined by the Australian school are generalisations of bimonoids/bialgebras, whereas internal categories generalise monoids (via horizontal categorification). Hmm, I wasn't paying attention in that talk as much as I thought I was.
