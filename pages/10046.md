## Definitions

Let $P$ be a [[poset]] with [[directed joins]].

### Elementary definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For $a, b \in P$, we say that $a$ is **way below** $b$ and write $a \ll b$ if whenever $S \subseteq P$ is a [[directed subset]] and $b \leq \bigvee S$ (where $\bigvee S$ denotes the [[join]] of $S$), then there exists $s \in S$ with $a \leq s$.
=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
We say that $P$ is **continuous** if for every $a\in P$, the subset
$$ \Downarrow (a) \coloneqq \{ b \in P | b \ll a \} $$
is directed and has join $a$.
=--

If $P$ also has finite joins, hence is a [[suplattice]], then $\Downarrow(a)$ is automatically directed, so the condition reduces to $\bigvee (\Downarrow(a)) = a$; in this case $P$ is called a **continuous lattice**.


### Adjoint characterization

Let $Idl(P)$ denote the poset of [[ideals]] in $P$, i.e. subsets that are downward-closed and upwards-directed.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A poset $P$ has directed joins if and only if the [[principal-ideal]] map $\downarrow : P \to Idl(P)$, defined by
$$ \downarrow(a) \coloneqq \{ b \in P | b \leq a \} ,$$
has a [[left adjoint]], which must be $\bigvee$.
=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
A poset $P$ with directed joins is continuous if and only if $\bigvee: Idl(P) \to P$ has its own left adjoint, which must be $\Downarrow$.
=--

This characterization generalizes directly to the notion of [[continuous category]].


## Morphisms

## Properties

* Continuous lattices are those [[complete lattices]] for which taking [[suprema]] of directed subsets commutes with taking [[infima]] of arbitrary subsets. 

* A [[frame]] is a continuous lattice just when its corresponding [[locale]] is [[locally compact locale|locally compact]], or equivalently [[exponentiable object|exponentiable]] in the [[category of locales]].

* The [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from the category of continuous lattices (with morphisms those maps preserving directed joins and arbitrary meets) to the [[category of sets]] is a [[monadic functor]]. Here the left adjoint of $U$ takes a set $X$ to the lattice of [[filters]] on $X$ (that is filters in the [[power set]] Boolean algebra $P X$). 

* The category of continuous lattices, with morphisms those maps which preserve directed joins (aka [[Scott-continuous function]]s), is a [[cartesian closed category]]. This category was used by [[Dana Scott]] to construct models of the untyped [[lambda calculus]].
