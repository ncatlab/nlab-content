## Definition

Let $P$ be a [[poset]] with [[directed joins]].

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For $a,b\in P$, we say that $a$ is **way below** $b$ and write $a\ll b$ if whenever $S\subseteq P$ is a directed subset and $b\le \bigvee S$ (where $\bigvee S$ denotes the join of $S$), then there exists $s\in S$ with $a\le s$.
=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
We say that $P$ is **continuous** if for every $a\in P$, the set $\Downarrow (a) = \{ b\in P | b\ll a \}$ is directed and has join $a$.
=--

If $P$ also has finite joins, hence is a [[complete lattice]], then $\Downarrow(a)$ is automatically directed, so the condition reduces to $\bigvee (\Downarrow(a))=a$; in this case $P$ is called a **continuous lattice**.

## Adjoint characterization

Let $Idl(P)$ denote the poset of [[ideals]] in $P$, i.e. subsets that are downward-closed and upwards-directed.  To say that $P$ has directed joins is exactly to say that the principal-ideal map $\downarrow : P \to Idl(P)$, defined by $\downarrow(a)=\{b\in P | b\le a\}$, has a left adjoint $\bigvee$.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
A poset $P$ with directed joins is continuous if and only if $\bigvee: Idl(P) \to P$ has a left adjoint.  In this case, the left adjoint is $\Downarrow$.

## Properties

* Continuous lattices are those complete lattices for which taking [[suprema]] of directed subsets commutes with taking [[infima]] of arbitrary subsets. 

* A [[frame]] is a continuous lattice just when its corresponding [[locale]] is [[locally compact locale]], hence [[exponentiable object|exponentiable]].

* The forgetful functor from the category of continuous lattices (with morphisms those maps preserving directed joins and arbitrary meets) to sets is a [[monadic functor]]. Here the left adjoint takes a set $X$ to the lattice of filters in the power set Boolean algebra $P X$. 

* The category of continuous lattices, with morphisms those maps which preserve directed joins (aka Scott-continuous maps), is a [[cartesian closed category]]. This category was used by [[Dana Scott]] to construct models of the untyped [[lambda calculus]].
