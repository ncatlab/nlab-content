## Definition

A [[function]] on (some subset of) a [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is **smooth**, or __infinitely differentiable__, if all its [[derivative]]s exist at all points. 

By [[coinduction]]: A [[function]] $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is _smooth_ if 1. it's [[derivative]] exists and 2. the derivative is itself a smooth function.

The concept can be generalised from cartesian spaces to [[Banach spaces]] and some other infinite-dimensional spaces.  There is a [[locale]]-based analogue suitable for [[constructive mathematics]] which is not described as a function of points but as a special case of a [[continuous map]] (in the localic sense).

A [[manifold]] whose transition functions are smooth functions is a [[smooth manifold]]. The [[category]] [[Diff]] is the category whose objects are smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth functions betweeen them.

Yet more generally, the morphisms between [[generalised smooth spaces]] are smooth maps.

For functions between manifolds that fall short of full smoothness, see [[differentiable map]].


## Properties

Basic facts about smooth functions are

* the [[Hadamard lemma]]

* [[Borel's theorem]]

* the [[Tietze extension theorem]]

* the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]]


## Examples


Every [[analytic functions]] (for instance a [[holomorphic function]]) is also a smooth function.

A crucial property of smooth functions, however, is that they contain also [[bump functions]].
