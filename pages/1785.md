Владимир Воеводский (who published in English as Vladimir Voevodsky) ([web site](http://www.math.ias.edu/~vladimir/Site3/home.html)) was a Russian mathematician working in the Institute for Advanced Study.

He received a [[Fields medal]] in 2002 for a [[proof]] of the [[Milnor conjecture]]. The proof crucially uses [[A1-homotopy theory]] and [[motivic cohomology]] developed by Voevodsky for this purpose. In further development of this in 2009 Voevodsky announced a proof of the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]].

After this work in [[algebraic geometry]], [[cohomology]] and [[homotopy theory]] Voevodsky turned to the [[foundations of mathematics]] and worked on [[homotopy type theory]] which he described as a new "[[univalence|univalent]] foundations" for modern mathematics with its emphasis on [[homotopy theory]] and [[higher category theory]].
