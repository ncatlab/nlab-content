## Idea

In [[quantum electrodynamics]] the square of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ of the [[electron-photon interaction]] is called the _fine structure constant_

$$
  \alpha = \tfrac{1}{4 \pi} g^2
  \,.
$$

Historically the term originates from the fact via [[perturbative QFT]] effects such as the [[Lamb shift]], this constant governs tiny corrections ("fine structure") to the [[energy]] spectrum of the [[electron]] in the [[hydrogen atom]].
