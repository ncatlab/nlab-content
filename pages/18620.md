## Idea

In ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]], what is called _Bogoliubov's formula_, originally due to ([Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59](#BogoliubovShirkov59)) is an expression for the [[interacting quantum observables]] as the [[derivatives]] with respect to a [[source field]] of the [[generating function]] corresponding to a given [[S-matrix]].

Originally this is an ad-hoc formula, motivated by the would-be [[path integral]] picture of the [[Feynman perturbation series]] (remark \ref{InterpretationOfPerturbativeSMatrix} below) and mathematically justified by the fact that it does yield a [[causally local net of observables]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] (prop. \ref{CausalLocalityOfBogoliubovFormula} below).

Much more recently it was shown that Bogoliubov's formula indeed expresses quantum observables as systematically obtained by [[Fedosov deformation quantization]] of [[field theory]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](#HawkinsRejzner16)).


## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $p + 1$ and let $E \overset{fb}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma$ be a [[field bundle]]. Let $\mathbf{L}_{free}\in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E)$ be a [[local Lagrangian density]] for a [[free field theory]] with [[field (physics)|fields]] of type $E$. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the corresponding [[Wick algebra]] of [[quantum observables]] of the free field, with 

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc} \overset{:(-):}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{W}
$$

the corresponding quantization map from [[local observables]] ("[[normal ordering]]").

Let then 

$$
  S
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{F}_{loc}\langle g,j\rangle 
    \longrightarrow 
  \mathcal{W}[ [ g/\hbar ] ][ [ j/\hbar ] ]
$$ 

be a  [[perturbative S-matrix]]. Moreover let

$$
  g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}\langle g\rangle
$$ 

be an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]
[[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]], so that the full Lagrangian density is

$$
  \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{L}_{free} + g \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \,.
$$


For $A \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}$ a [[local observable]] and $j \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)$, write

$$
  Z_L(\epsilon j A)
  \; \coloneqq \;
  S(g_{sw}\mathbf{L}_{int})^{-1} S( g_{sw}\mathbf{L}_{int} + j A )
$$

for the [[generating function]] induced by the perturbative [[S-matrix]] (where the product shown by juxtaposition is that in the [[Wick algebra]], hence the [[star product]] induced by the [[Wightman propagator]]).



+-- {: .num_defn #GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions}
###### Definition
**([[Bogoliubov's formula]])**


The perturbative
[[quantum observable]] $\widehat{A}$ corresponding to $A$ is the [[operator-valued distribution]]

$$
  \widehat{A}
  \;\colon\;
  C^\infty_c(\Sigma)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{W}[ [ g ] ][ [ \hbar ] ]
$$

which is the [[derivative]] of the generating functional $Z$ ([this def.](S-matrix#PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime)) at vanishing [[source field]]:

$$
  \widehat{A}(j)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} \frac{d}{d \epsilon} Z_{g_{sw} L_{int}}( \epsilon j  A)\vert_{\epsilon = 0}
  \,.
$$


=--

This definition of $\widehat{A}$ without the [[adiabatic switching]] $g_{sw}$ is originally due to [Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59](#BogoliubovShirkov59), later named _Bogoliubov's formula_ (e.g. [Rejzner 16 (6.12)](#Rejzner16)).
The version with adiabatic switching is due to ([Epstein-Glaser 73 around (74)](#EpsteinGlaser73)). Review includes ([D&#252;tsch-Fredenhagen 00, around (17)](#DuetschFredenhagen00)).

This assignment is also called the _[[quantum Møller operator]]_.

The [[coefficients]] of $\widehat{A}(j)$ as a [[formal power series]] in the [[coupling constant]] and [[Planck's constant]] are called the _[[retarded products]]_.


+-- {: .num_remark #PowersInPlancksConstant}
###### Remark
**(powers in [[Planck's constant]])**

That the observables as defined in def. \ref{GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions} indeed are [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ as opposed to more general [[Laurent series]] requires a little argument.

The explicit $\hbar$-dependence of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] is 

$$
  S(g_{sw} L_{int} + j_{sw} A)
  = 
  T \exp\left(
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}
     \left(
       g_{sw} L_{int} + j_{sw} A
     \right)
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $T(-)$ denotes [[time-ordered products]]. The generating function

$$
  Z_{g_{sw}L_{int}}(j A)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  S(g_{sw}L_{int})^{-1} \star S(g_{sw}L_{int} + j_{sw} A)
$$

involves the [[star product]] of the free theory (the [[normal-ordered product]] of the [[Wick algebra]]). This is a [[formal deformation quantization]] of the [[Peierls-Poisson bracket]], and therefore the [[commutator]] in this algebra is a [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ that however has no constant term in $\hbar$ (but starts out with $\hbar$ times the [[Poisson bracket]], followed by possibly higher order terms in $\hbar$):

$$
  [L_{int},A] \;=\; \hbar(\cdots)
  \,.
$$

Now schematically the derivative of the generating function is of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat A
    & \coloneqq
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} \frac{d}{d \epsilon}
    Z_{g_{sw}L_{int}}(\epsilon j A)\vert_{\epsilon = 0}
    \\
    & =
    \exp\left(
      \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}[g_{sw}L_{int}, -]
    \right)
    (j A)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

(The precise expression is given by the _[[retarded products]]_, see [Rejzner 16, prop. 6.1](#Rejzner16).)
By the above, the exponent here yields a [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$, and hence so does the full exponential.


That the quantum observables takes values in formal power series of $\hbar$ is the hallmark of [[formal deformation quantization]]. While [[Bogoliubov's formula]] proceeds from an [[S-matrix]] which is axiomatized by [[causal perturbation theory]], this suggests that it actually computes the quantum observables in a [[formal deformation quantization]] of the interacting field theory. This is indeed the case ([Collini 16](#Collini16), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](#HawkinsRejzner16)).

For the analogous analysis of powers of $\hbar$ in the [[S-matrix]] itself, see at _[[loop order]]_ the section _[Relation to powers in Planck's constant](loop%20order#RelationToPowersInPlancksConstant)_.

## Properties

### Relation to the would-be path integral


+-- {: .num_remark #InterpretationOfPerturbativeSMatrix}
###### Remark
**(interpretation of Bogoliubov's formula via a "[[path integral]]")**

In informal heuristic discussion of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[S-matrix]] is thought of as a [[path integral]],
written

$$
  S\left(
    \tfrac{g}{\hbar} L_{int} + j
  \right)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{=}\;
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{asmpt}}{\int}
  \exp\left(
    \int_X
    \left(
      \tfrac{g}{i \hbar} L_{int}(\Phi) + j A(\Phi)
    \right)
  \right)  e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_X L_{free}(\Phi) }D[\Phi]
$$

where the integration is thought to be over the [[configuration space]] $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{asmpt}$ of [[field (physics)|fields]] $\Phi$
(the [[space of sections]] of the given [[field bundle]])
which satisfy given asymptotic conditions at $x^0 \to \pm \infty$; and as these boundary conditions
vary the above is regarded as an integral kernel that defines the required operator in $\mathcal{W}$.

With the perturbative S-matrix informally thought of as a path integral this way,  the the Bogoliubov formula in def. \ref{GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions}
similarly would have the following interpretation:

$$
  \widehat A(j)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{=}\;
  \frac{
    \int
    j A(\Phi)
    \exp\left(
      \int_X
      \left(
        \tfrac{g}{i \hbar} L_{int}(\Phi)
      \right)
    \right)  e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_X L_{free}(\Phi) }D[\Phi]
  }
  {
    \int
    \exp\left(
      \int_X
      \left(
        \tfrac{g}{i \hbar} L_{int}(\Phi)
      \right)
    \right)  e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_X L_{free}(\Phi) }D[\Phi]
  }
$$

If here we were to regard the expression

$$
  \mu(\Phi)
  \;\overset{\text{not really}}{\coloneqq}\;
  \frac{
    \exp\left(
      \int_X
      \left(
        \tfrac{g}{i \hbar} L_{int}(\Phi)
      \right)
    \right)  e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_X L_{free}(\Phi) }D[\Phi]
  }
  {
    \int
    \exp\left(
      \int_X
      \left(
        \tfrac{g}{i \hbar} L_{int}(\Phi)
      \right)
    \right)  e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_X L_{free}(\phi) }D[\phi]
  }
$$

as a "complex probability measure" on the the configuration space of fields, then this formula
would express the [[expectation value]] of the functional $A$ under this measure:

$$
  \widehat{A}(j) \overset{\text{not really!}}{=} [j A]_{\mu} = \int j A(\Phi) \mu(\Phi)
  \,.
$$

### Causal locality of interacting field quantum observables


+-- {: .num_prop #CausalLocalityOfBogoliubovFormula}
###### Proposition
**([[causal locality]])**

As the spacetime support varies, the algebras of [[interacting field quantum observables]] spanned via the Bogoliubov formula consistitute a [[causally local net of observables]], hence an instance of [[perturbative AQFT]].
