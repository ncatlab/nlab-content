The notion of _enriched Reedy category_ is a combination of that of [[Reedy category]] and [[enriched category]].

The main motivation for studying [[Reedy category|Reedy categories]] is that they induce [[Reedy model structure]]s on [[functor category|functor categories]].

The motivation for studying enriched Reedy categories is that they induced [[Reedy model structure|enriched Reedy model structures]] on [[enriched functor category|enriched functor categories]].
