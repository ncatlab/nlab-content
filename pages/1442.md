#Idea#

A _locally modeled monoid_ or,  _$R$-Ring_, is a generalized quantity in the sense of [[space and quantity]] which is modeled on a [[category of local models]].

#Definition#

Let $(R,U,L,A)$ be a [[category of local models]]. Then an **$R$-ring** or **monoid locally modeled on $R$** is a co-[[presheaf]]

$$
  R \to Sets
$$

which preserves the limits in $L$.

A morphism of such locally modeled monoids is a natural transformation.

#Examples#

* for $R = Ring^{op}$, $R$-rings are just ordinary rings.

* for $R = $ [[CartSp]], $R$-rings are [[generalized smooth algebra]]s.
