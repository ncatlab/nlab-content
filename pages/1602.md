## Idea

A **Green-Schwarz mechanism** is a modification of an [[action functional]] of a [[quantum field theory]] involving higher [[gauge field]]s that makes a [[quantum anomaly]] of the original action functional disappear.

More in detail:

* An [[action functional]] in [[path integral|path integral quantization]] is said to be [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]] if it is only locally identified with a function on the configuration space of fields, but is globally instead a section of a line [[bundle]] (usually equipped with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]).

* Given two anomalous action functionals in this sense, it may happen that while the two corresponding line bundles on configuration space are each nontrivial, their [[tensor product]] becomes trivializable. In this case one can consider the non-anomalous action function given by the sum of the two anomalous action functionals. This is what is called **anomaly cancellation** of one piece of an action functional against another. 

* The two main sources of examples for action functionals that are anomalous are

  * the standard action functional for chiral fermions 

    * this is a section of the [[Pfaffian line bundle]] for the 
      [[Dirac operator]]

  * the action functional for [[differential cohomology|differential cocycles]] (higher connection, higher [[gauge theory]]) in the presence of [[electric charge|electric]] and [[magnetic charge]]s: 

    * this is a [[section]] of the [[transgression]] of the 
      [[line bundle]] arising as the [[cup product]] of 
      the [[electric charge|electric]] and 
      [[magnetic charge|magnetic differential cocycles]].


A **Green--Schwarz mechanism** is the addition of an action functional for higher differential cocycles with [[magnetic charge]]s such that their [[quantum anomaly]] cancels a given [[Pfaffian line bundle]]: so it is a choice of by itself ill-defined action functional for higher gauge theory that cancels the ill-definedness of an action functional for chiral fermions.

In the more strict and original sense of the word, _the_ Green--Schwarz mechanism is the application of this procedure in the theory called [[heterotic string theory|heterotic supergravity]]: there it so happens that the Pfaffian line bundle of the fermionic action has as [[Chern class]] the [[transgression]] of a degree-12 class in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that factorizes as $I_8 \wedge I_4$. Since heterotic supergravity contains a higher gauge field that couples to [[string theory|strings]], this is precisely of the form $J_{electric} \wedge J_{magnetic}$ that the anomaly for the corresponding higher gauge theory in the presence of magnetic charges gives rise to. So the original Green--Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism consist of modifying the "naive" action functional for heterotic supergravity by adding the contribution that corresponds to adding a magnetic current of the form

$$
  j_B := I_4
  \,.
$$

## The higher magnetic charge anomaly


### The higher abelian Yang-Mills action functional 
  {#YMactionfunctional}

Consider on some [[spacetime]] $X$ a [[gauge field]] $[\nabla] \in H_{diff}^{n+1}(X)$ modeled in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] in degree $n+1$: a [[circle n-bundle with connection]]. For instance

* in degree $n=1$ this is an [[electromagnetic field]];

* in degree $n=2$ this is a [[Kalb-Ramond field]];

* in degree $n = 3$ a [[supergravity C-field]].

Canonically associated to the [[gauge field]] is its [[field strength]]: the [[curvature]] [[differential form]]

$$
  F_\nabla \in \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(X)
  \,.
$$

The abelian [[Yang-Mills action functional]] for our gauge field (the [[action functional]] of higher order [[electromagnetism]]) is the [[function]]

$$
  \exp(i S_{YM}(-)) : H_{diff}^{n+1}(X) \to \mathbb{C}
$$

that sends the field $\nabla$

$$
  \exp(i S_{YM}(-))
    : 
  [\nabla] 
   \mapsto 
  \exp(-i \int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla)
$$

to the [[exponential]] of the [[integral]] over the [[spacetime]] $X$ of the  [[differential form]] obtained as the [[wedge product]] of the [[curvature form]] with its image under the [[Hodge star operator]] correspondonding to the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$.

The fact that this map [[function]] defined in terms of [[cocycle]]s is a well defined function on [[cohomology]] means that the [[action functional]] is [[gauge transformation|gauge invariant]]. At this point this is just the trivial statement that under a [[gauge transformation]]

$$
  \nabla \stackrel{g}{\to} \nabla'
$$

the [[curvature]] invariant: $F_\nabla = F_{\nabla'}$.



### ... with electric charge ...
  {#WithElectricCharge}

The [above](#YMactionfunctional) [[action functional]] describes the dynamics of the [[gauge field]] all by itself, with no interactions with other fields or with [[relativistic particle|fundamental particle]]s/[[brane|fundamental brane]]s.

A distribution of  $n$-[[electric charge]] on $X$ is modeled itself by a [[cocycle]] $\hat j_E$ in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] in degree $dim X - n$

$$
  [\hat j_E] \in H_{diff}^{dim X - d}(X)
  \,.
$$

The [[curvature]] $j_E$ of $\hat j_E$ is the [[electric current]] form. The [[action functional]] that encodes the [[force]] of the [[gauge field]] exerted on this electric charge distribution is locally on [[coordinate chart]]s $U \subset X$ given by the [[integral]] $\int_X A_U \wedge j_E$, where $A_U$ is the local [[connection on an infinity-bundle|connection]] $n$-form of the gauge fiedl $\nabla$.

Globally, this contribution is given by the push-forward 

$$
  2 \pi i\int_X (-) : H_{diff}^{dim X}(X) \to H_{diff}^0(*) = U(1)
$$ 

of the [[cup product]] $\hat j_E \cdot \nabla$ in [[ordinary differential cohomology]].

In total the [[action functional]] of higher abelian [[Yang-Mills theory]] in the presence of [[electric charge]] is the [[function]]

$$
  \exp(i S_{YM}(-) + i S_{el}(-)) 
    :
  H^{n+1}_{diff}(X) 
   \times
  H^{dim X - n}_{diff}(X)
   \to
  \mathbb{C}
$$

given by

$$
  ([\nabla], [\hat j_E]) 
     \mapsto
  \exp(i \int(\int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla))
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_X \hat j_E \cdot \nabla)
  \,.
$$


### ... and with magnetic charge.

We now consider one more additional term in the [[action functional]], one that desribes moreover the interaction of our [[gauge field]] with a distribution of $n$-[[magnetic charge]] on $X$, in addition to the interaction with the distribution of [[electric charge]] described 
[above](#WithElectricCharge).

The [[magnetic charge]] distribution itself is also modeled as a  [[cocycle]] $\hat j_B$ in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. As opposed to the [[electric charge]] it is however not part of the dynamics but of the kinemtics of the system: it does not manifestly show up in the integral expression for the [[action functional]], but does modify the nature of the configuration space that this action functional is defined on.

Namely the kinematic higher [[Maxwell equations]] is a condition of the form

$$
  d F_\nabla = j_B
  \,,
$$

where $j_B$ is the [[magnetic charge]] distribution. If $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection]], then necessarily $d F_\nabla = 0$. Therefore the system of higher electromagnetism in the presence of magnetic charge cannot be modeled any more by [[cocycle]]s in [[ordinary differential cohomology]].

One fines that instead, more one has to model $\nabla$ not as a [[circle n-bundle with connection]], but as an $n$-[[twisted bundle]] with connection, where the [[twisted cohomology|twisgt]] is $\hat j_B$. 

We shall write $C^{n+1}_{diff}(X)_{\hat j_B}$ for the [[∞-groupoid]] of twisted cocycles for this fixed twist. The crucial point is now the following:

the [above](#WithElectricCharge) expression 

$$
  \exp(i S_{el}(\nabla, \hat j_E)) 
    :
    \exp(2 \pi i \int_X \hat j_E \cdot \nabla)
$$

for the electric coupling can still be given sense, even with $\nabla \in C^{n+1}_{diff}(X)_{\hat j_B}$, but it no longer has the interpretation of a [[circle group]]-valued [[function]]. Rather, it has now the interpretation of a [[section]] of a [[line bundle]] 

$$
  \array{
    && Anom
    \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\exp(S_{el})}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    Conf &=& Conf
  }
$$

on cofiguration space. The [[characteristic class]] of this line bundle -- its  [[Chern class]] -- is hence the _magnetic anomaly_ in higher gauge theory.

In the next section we formalize properly the notion of this line bundle on configuration space.

### The anomaly line bundle

In order to formalize this we have to refine the formalization of the structure of the configuration space. So far we had regarded the [[set]] $H^{dim X - n}_{diff}(X) \times H_{diff}^{n+1}(X)$ of gauge equivalence classes of field configurations. This is the set of connected components of the full [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]]

$$
  C^{dim X - n}_{diff}(X) \times C_{diff}^{n+1}(X)
  \in
  \infty Grpd
$$

whose

* [[object]]s are field configurations on $X$;

* [[morphism]]s are [[gauge transformation]]s;

* [[2-morphism]]s are gauge transformations of gauge transformation, 

* and so on.

Moreover this cocycle [[∞-groupoid]] is not just a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] but it naturally has _smooth structure_ : it is naturally a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]: an [[∞-stack]] over the [[category]] [[SmoothMfd]]. We shall write

$$
  Conf :=
  [X,(\mathbf{B}^{n}U(1) \times \mathbf{B}^{dim X - n-1}U(1))_{conn}]
  \in 
  Smooth∞Grpd
$$

for this smooth $\infty$-groupoid of configuration of the physical system -- defined as the [[internal hom]] in terms of the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity%2C1)-topos#ClosedMonoidalStructure">closed monoidal structure on the (∞,1)-topos</a> [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of $X \in SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth∞Grpd$ into the target object of the higher [[gauge theory]], (this object is discussed in detail <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#StrucDifferentialCohomology">here</a>; it is presented under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] by the [[Deligne complex]] of sheaves on [[CartSp]]).

This smooth structure is characterized by saying that for any $U \in$ [[SmoothMfd]] the $U$-parameterized smooth families of field configurations, gauge transformations, etc. form the [[∞-groupoid]] 

$$
  Conf(U) 
   \simeq 
  C^{dim X - n}_{diff}(U \times X) \times C_{diff}^{n+1}(U \times X )
$$

of gauge fields on the [[product]] of [[spacetime]] $X$ with the parameter space $U$. (See for instance [[Lie integeration]] and [[connection on an ∞-bundle]] for details on how differential forms on $U \times X$ encode $U$-families of forms on $X$).
