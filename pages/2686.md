## Idea

A [[Poisson manifold]] may be thought of as a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]], a [[Lie algebroid]] with extra structure: called an [[n-symplectic manifold]] for $n = 1$.

By [[Lie integration]] this Lie algebroid should integrate to a [[Lie groupoid]] with extra structure. Symplectic groupoids are supposed to be these objects that integrate [[n-symplectic manifold]] aka [[Poisson manifold]]s in this sense.

The [[category algebra|groupoid algebra]] of these symplectic groupoids are [[C-star algebra]]s that may be regarded as the [[quantization]] of the original [[Poisson manifold]]. This is described in the references below.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

The original definition of ([Weinstein](#Weinstein)) is this:

+-- {: .num_defn #WeinsteinsDefintion}
###### Definition

A **symplectic Lie groupoid** is a [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathbf{X}_\bullet$ whose manifold of [[morphisms]] $\mathbf{X}_1$ is equipped with a [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] whose symplectic form $\omega \in \Omega^2_{closed}(\mathbf{X}_1)$ is _multiplicative_ in that the alternating sum of its canonical [[pullback of a differential form|pullbacks]] to the space $\mathbf{X}_2$ of composable morphisms vanishes:

$$
 0 = 
  \delta \omega = pr_1^* \omega - compose^* \omega 
  + pr_2^* \omega
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The manifold of [[objects]] $\mathbf{X}_0$ of a symplectic Lie groupoid $\mathbf{X}_\bullet$, def. \ref{WeinsteinsDefintion}, carries the structure of a [[Poisson manifold]] which is unique, up to [[isomorphism]], with the property that the target map $t \colon \mathbf{X}_1 \to \mathbf{X}_0$ is a [[homomorphism]] of [[Poisson manifolds]] (canonically regarding the [[symplectic manifold]] $(\mathbf{X}_1, \omega)$ as a Poisson manifold).

The [[Poisson manifolds]] that arise this way as $\mathbf{X}_0$ of a symplectic Lie groupoid are called **integrable Poisson manifolds**.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Reformulated more abstractly, def. \ref{WeinsteinsDefintion} says that the differential form $\omega$, when extended to a triple

$$
  (0, \omega, 0)
  \in
  \oplus_{k = 0,1,2} \Omega^{3-k}(\mathbf{X}_{k})
$$

is a [[cocycle]] of degree 3 in the [[de Rham complex]] of $\mathbf{X}$, identified with the [[simplicial de Rham complex]] of the [[nerve]] $X_\bullet$ of $X$.

=--

This observation leads to the following generalization

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **pre-quasi symplectic groupoid** is a [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathbf{X}$ equipped with a [[differential 2-form]] $\omega_2 \in \Omega^2(\mathbf{X}_1)$ and a differential 3-form $\omega_3 \in \Omega^3(\mathbf{X}_0)$ such that 

$$
  (0, \omega_2, \omega_3) \in \oplus_{k = 0,1,2} \Omega^{3-k}(\mathbf{X}_{k})
$$

is a [[cocycle]] in the [[simplicial de Rham complex]] of $\mathbf{X}_\bullet$, hence such that 

$$
  \delta \omega_2 = 0
$$

$$
  d\omega_2 + \delta \omega_3 = 0
  \,,
$$

where $\delta = \sum_{k} (-1)^k \partial_k^*$ is the alternating sum of the [[pullback of a differential form|pullbacks]] along the face maps of the [[nerve]] $\mathbf{X}_\bullet$.

=--

This appears as ([Xu, def. 2.1](#Xu), [LG-Xu, def. 2.1](#LGX)). This structure is called a **twisted presymplectic groupoid** in ([BCWZ, def. 2.1](#BCWZ)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Since therefore a (pre-)symplectic groupoid is really a Lie groupoid equipped with a cocycle in degree-3 [[de Rham cohomology]] (instead of degree 2 as for a symplectic manifold),  it is really rather an object in [[2-plectic geometry]].

## Properties 

### Lie integration and Poisson manifolds

Every [[Lie groupoid]] [[Lie integration|integrating]] a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] is naturally a symplectic Lie groupoid. Picking always the unique source-simply connected integrating [[Lie groupoid]] produces a [[functor]]

$$
  \Sigma : PoissonManifolds \to SymplecticGroupoids
  \,.
$$

When the [[Poisson manifold]] we start with happens to be a [[symplectic manifold]], then its symplectic Lie groupoid is always the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$:

$$
  (X,\pi)\;\; symplectic
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
  \Sigma(X,\pi) \simeq_{iso} \Pi(X)
  \,.
$$

When $X$ is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] such that $\Pi(X)$ is the [[codiscrete category|codiscrete groupoid]] $Pair(X)$ we have that the symplectic form on $Mor(\Pi(X)) = X \times X$ is $\omega \otimes (-\omega)$, for $\omega$ the [[symplectic manifold|symplectic form]] on $X$.

Conversely, for every symplectic groupoid $\mathbf{X}$ there is a unique [[Poisson manifold]] structure on its manifold $\mathbf{X}_0$ of objects such that the [[codomain]] map $t \colon \mathbf{X}_1 \to \mathbf{X}_0$ is a [[homomorphism]] of [[Poisson manifolds]]. (For instance [Racaniere, theorem 6.3](#Racaniere)) One says also that $\mathbf{X}$ **integrates the Poisson manifold** $\mathbf{X}_0$.

### Symplectic realization

The source map of a symplectic groupoid over a Poisson manifold constitutes a _[[symplectic realization]]_ of this Poisson manifold, hence its canonical desingularization via [[Lie integration]]. See at _[[symplectic realization]]_ for more. 


### In geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds 

In the _groupoid approach to quantization_  symplectic groupoids are used to discuss [[geometric quantization]] not just of [[symplectic manifold]]s but more generally of [[Poisson manifold]]s.

See [[geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids]].

### As Lie integration of Poisson Lie algebroid

(...)

### A reduced phase space of open Poisson sigma-model

The symplectic groupoid of a Poisson manifold is also the 
[[reduced phase space]] of the open sector of the 
correspondng [[Poisson sigma-model]]. ([Cattaneo-Felder 01](#CattaneoFelder01))

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] with [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ and consider the [[dual vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$ equipped with its
[[Lie-Poisson structure]]. Then the [[action groupoid]] $\mathfrak{g}^* //G$ of the [[coadjoint action]] carries a multiplicative symplectic form $\omega$ induced by the identification $G \times \mathfrak{g}^* \simeq T^* G$ by right translation from the [[Poincare form]] on the [[cotangent bundle]]. This makes $(\mathfrak{g}^* //G, \omega)$ a symplectic groupoid which integrates $\mathfrak{g}^*$.
