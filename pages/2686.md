## Idea

A [[Poisson manifold]] may be thought of as a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]], a [[Lie algebroid]] with extra structure: called an [[n-symplectic manifold]] for $n = 1$.

By [[Lie integration]] this Lie algebroid should integrate to a [[Lie groupoid]] with extra structure. Symplectic groupoids are supposed to be these objects that integrate [[n-symplectic manifold]] aka [[Poisson manifold]]s in this sense.

The [[category algebra|groupoid algebra]] of these symplectic groupoids are [[C-star algebra]]s that may be regarded as the [[quantization]] of the original [[Poisson manifold]]. This is described in the references below.

## Definition

A **symplectic Lie groupoid** is a [[Lie groupoid]] $C$ whose space of [[object]]s is a [[Poisson manifold]] and whose space of [[morphism]]s carries a [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] whose symplectic form $\omega \in \Omega^2_{closed}(Mor(C))$ is _multiplicative_ in that it is closed regarded as an element in the [[simplicial deRham complex]] of the [[nerve]] of $C$:

$$
  0 = d \omega 
$$

$$
 0 = 
  \delta \omega = pr_1^* \omega - compose^* \omega 
  + pr_2^* \omega
$$


## Properties 

### General

Every [[Lie groupoid]] [[Lie integration|integrating]] a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] is naturally a symplectic Lie groupoid. Picking always the unique source-simply connected integrating [[Lie groupoid]] produces a [[functor]]

$$
  \Sigma : PoissonManifolds \to SymplecticGroupoids
  \,.
$$

When the [[Poisson manifold]] we start with happens to be a [[symplectic manifold]], then its symplectic Lie groupoid is always the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$:

$$
  ((X,\pi) symplectic)
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
  (\Sigma(X,\pi) = \Pi(X))
  \,.
$$

When $X$ is [[fundamental group|simply connected]] such that $\Pi(X)$ is the [[codiscrete category|codiscrete groupoid]] $Pair(X)$ we have that the symplectic form on $Mor(\Pi(X)) = X \times X$ is $\omega \otimes (-\omega)$, for $\omega$ the [[symplectic manifold|symplectic form]] on $X$.

### In geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds 

In the _groupoid approach to quantization_  symplectic groupoids are used to discuss [[geometric quantization]] not just of [[symplectic manifold]]s but more generally of [[Poisson manifold]]s.
