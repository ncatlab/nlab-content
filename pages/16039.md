Generalized higher loop spaces are analogs of [[loop spaces]] adapted to the setting of [[overconvergent global analytic geometry]].

## Overview

Recall that one may define higher Hochschild homology of a derived scheme as functions on its completed formal higher loop space
$$\hat{L}^n X:=\widehat{Hom}_{dSt}(S^n,X).$$
There is a natural action of the symmetry group of $S^n$ on this space. One may try to define analogs of this construction for other symmetry groups, at least on a local field, to try to use these spaces to study representation theory.

The basic idea here is to start with the non-strict analytic space $GL_n$, and look at the mapping space
$$L_{GL_n}X:=\widehat{Hom}_{dSt}(GL_n,X).$$
It may only be definable for usual spaces, not Artin stacks, but one has to check that.

In any case, there is a natural (in the setting of [[generalized global analytic geometry]]) subgroup $U(n)\subset GL_n$, and one may also consider
$$L_{U(n)}X:=\widehat{Hom}_{dSt}(U(n),X).$$
Normally, since $U(n)$ is proper, this space is finite dimensional in the differential stacky sense. One may then define linear and unitary higher Hochschild cohomology of dimension $n$ to be given by functions on the moduli spaces
$$M_{GL_n}X:=[L_{GL_n}X/GL_n]$$
and
$$M_{U(n)}X:=[L_{U(n)}X/U(n)].$$
Up to $D^1$-homotopy, both spaces should be identical. Now the unitary moduli space has a strict global definition, which means it is a very rigid object (essentially, a kind of Arakelov stack, given by a scheme-moduli stack together with an archimedean structure).

The determinant map $det:GL_n\to GL_1$ induces a natural morphism
$$det^*:L_{GL_n}X\to L_{GL_1}X,$$
which may give also a morphism
$$det^*:M_{GL_n}X\to M_{GL_1}X.$$

Remark now that there exists an exact sequence of (non-strict) analytic groups
$$1\to U(1)\to GL_1\to N_1\to 1$$
where $N$ is the group of norms of elements in $GL_1$. In dimension $n$, we
only have a groupoid $N_n$. However, there is always the possibility to define a new
moduli space given by
$$D_{GL_n}X:=[L_{GL_n}X/U(n)].$$

This moduli space is equipped with an action of the groupoid $N_n$. In dimension $1$ over $C$, if $X$ is say projective, we get, as functions on $D_{GL_1}(X)$, a (probably infinite dimensional) space over $C$ together with an action of $N_1\cong \mathbb{R}_+^*$. In the $p$-adic situation, we have $N_1=p^\mathbb{Z}$. On a global field, one may work over adeles to get a sensible construction.

One should also not forget that there is (in characteristic $0$, e.g., on adeles of $\mathbb{Q}$) a logarithm map
$$log:\overset{\circ}{D}(1,1)_{GL_1}\to Lie(GL_1)$$
that allows us to relate the above constructions to the notion of [[generalized lambda-structure]].
