## Idea

The **Mitchell--Bénabou language** is a particuarly simple form of the [[internal language]] of an [[elementary topos]] $E$.  It makes use of the fact that in the presence of a [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$, there is no need to treat formulas separately from [[terms]], since a formula or [[proposition]] can be identified with a term of [[type]] $\Omega$.

Specifically, the language is a [[type theory]] $L(E)$ where:

* the (closed) **[[types]]** are the [[objects]] of $E$;

* the **[[variables]]** of type $A$ are interpreted as [[identity morphism|identity morphisms]] $\mathrm{id}_A: A \to A$ in $E$;

* the **[[terms]]** of type $B$ in variables $x_i$ of type $X_i$ are interpreted as [[morphisms]] from the product of the $X_i$ to $B$

* the **[[formulas]]** are terms of type $\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the [[subobject classifier]];

* the [[propositional logic|propositional logical]] connectives are induced from the internal [[Heyting algebra]] structure of $\Omega$;

* the (type-bounded) [[quantifiers]] are induced from the internal completeness of $\Omega$ (i.e., the quantifiers are given by suitable morphisms from internal [[power object|powers]] of $\Omega$ to $\Omega$)

* for each type $X$ there are also two binary relations $=_X$ (defined applying the [[diagonal]] map to the [[product]] term of the arguments) and $\in_X$ (defined applying the evaluation map to the product of the term and the power term of the arguments);

* a formula is [[true]] if the arrow which interprets it factors through the arrow $true: 1 \to \Omega$.

* one can also construct type families and [[dependent types]], just as in any [[locally cartesian closed category]]: the types indexed by elements of some closed type $A$ are the objects of the [[slice category]] over $A$; [[dependent sum|sums]] and [[dependent product|products]] of type families (i.e., $\Sigma$- and $\Pi$-types) are given by the [[left adjoint|left]] and [[right adjoint]]s to [[base change|change-of-base functors]], respectively. As these slice categories will be topoi themselves, all the above structure can be interpreted for type families as well.

## Applications

The Mitchell--Bénabou language, like the [[internal logic]] of any [[category]], is a powerful way to describe various objects in a topos as if they were [[sets]].  It can be viewed as making the topos into a generalized [[set theory]] or a [[type theory]], so that we can write and prove statements in a topos, and properties of a topos, using [[first order logic|first order]] [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic predicate logic]].

As is usual for type theories, we can conversely generate a [[syntactic category|syntactic]] or [[free topos]] $E(L)$ from any suitable theory $L$ phrased in the above language.  The universal property of this topos says that [[logical functors]] $E(L)\to E$, for any other topos $E$, are equivalent to models of the theory $L$ in $E$.
