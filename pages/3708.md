## Idea

The notion of **tangent category** of a [[category]] $C$ is an approximation to the notion of [[tangent (∞,1)-category]] in ordinary [[category theory]]. 

For the moment see there for further motivation.

The tangent category $T_C$ of $C$ is effectively the _fiberwise abelianization_ of the [[codomain fibration]] $cod : [I,C] \to C$:

we may think of it as obtained from the codomain fibration by replacing each [[overcategory]] fiber $[I,C]_A = C/A$ by the corresponding category of abelian [[group object]]s and restricting the morphisms such as to respect the abelian group object structure.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[pullback]]s. Then the **tangent category** $T_C$ of $C$ is the category whose

* [[object]]s are pairs $(A,\mathcal{A})$ with $A \in Ob(C)$ and with $\mathcal{A}$ an abelian [[group object]] in the [[overcategory]] $C/B$;

  notice that for $\mathcal{B} \to B$ an object in the overcategory that is equipped with the structure of an abelian group object -- notably with a product $prod_{\mathcal{B}} : \mathcal{B} \times_B \mathcal{B} \to  \mathcal{B}$ -- and for $f : A \to B$ any morphism in $C$, the [[pullback]] $f^* \mathcal{B} := A \times_B \mathcal{B}$ in $C$ is naturally equipped with the structure of an abelian group object in $C/A$;
  

* [[morphism]]s $(f, \mathcal{f}) : (A,\mathcal{A}) \to (B, \mathcal{B})$ are commuting squares

  $$
    \array{
      \mathcal{A} &\stackrel{\mathcal{f}}{\to}& \mathcal{B}
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow 
      \\
      A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    }
  $$

  such that the induced morphism $\mathcal{A} \to f^*\mathcal{B}$ is a morphism of abelian group objects in $C/A$; 

* composition of morphisms is given in the evident way by $(f_2, \mathcal{f}_2) \circ (f_1, \mathcal{f}_1) = (f_2 \circ f_1, \mathcal{f}_2 \circ \mathcal{f}_1) $.

## Properties

There is an evident [[functor]] $p : T_C \to C$, the underlying [[codomain fibration]]:

$$
  p 
  \;\;:
  \;\; 
  \left(
    \array{
      \mathcal{A} &\stackrel{\mathcal{f}}{\to}& \mathcal{B}
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  (A \stackrel{f}{\to} B)
  \,.
$$

The fiber over $Id_A$ of this functor is the category of abelian group objects in the [[overcategory]] $C/A$:

$$ 
  (T_C)_A \simeq Ab(C/A)
  \,.
$$

There is also another functor $q : T_C \to C$, inherited from the [[domain cofibration]]

$$
  q 
  \;\;:
  \;\; 
  \left(
    \array{
      \mathcal{A} &\stackrel{\mathcal{f}}{\to}& \mathcal{B}
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  (\mathcal{A} \stackrel{\mathcal{f}}{\to} \mathcal{B})
  \,,
$$

where we first forget the abelian group object structure and then project onto the domains.


> (we should be claiming that this functor has a left adjoint which is a section and computes the [[cotangent complex]]es of objects in $C$).


## Examples

### Modules as tangents to rings {#OrdinaryModules}

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C = $ [[CRing]] we have $T_C \simeq $ [[Mod]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the functor
$$
 F: Mod \to T_{CRing}
$$

that sends an $R$-module $N$ to the square-0-extension ring $R \oplus N \stackrel{p_1}{\to} R$, regarded as an abelian group object in $CRing/R$.

The action on morphisms is given as follows: if $(R_1,N_1)$ and $(R_2,N_2)$ are two objects in [[Mod]], then a morphism between them is a pair $(f : R_1 \to R_2, f_*:N_1 \to f^* N_2)$ consisting of a ring homorphism and a morphism of $R_1$ modules from $N_1$ to $R_1 \otimes_f N_2$; the corresponding morphism of rings $R_1\oplus N_1\to R_2\oplus N_2$ is $(r_1,n_1)\mapsto (f(r_1),f_*(n_2))$. The induced morphism of rings $R_1\oplus N_1\to R_1\times_{R_2}(R_2\oplus N_2)\cong R_1\oplus f^*N_2$ is explicitly given by $(r_1,n_1)\mapsto (r_1,f_*(n_1))$ and is easily checked to be a morphism of abelian group objects over $R_1$.

Moreover, by the natural isomorphism $R_1\times_{R_2}(R_2\oplus N_2)\cong R_1\oplus f^*N_2$ in $Ab(CRing/R)$, showing that $F:Mod\to T_{CRing}$ is an equivalence is reduced to showing that $F$ is a fibrewise equivalence, i.e., that that for any fixed ring $R$,

$$
F_R:  Mod_R \to Ab(CRing/R)
$$

is an [[equivalence of categories]]. This is shown at [[module]].

### Modules over smooth algebras {#ModulesOverSmoothAlgebras}

Let $SmoothAlg$ (or $C^\infty Ring$) be the category of [[smooth algebra]]s. Notice that there is a canonical [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  U : SmoothAlg \to Ring
$$

to the underlying ordinary [[ring]]s.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
{#TangentOfSmoothAlgTheorem}

There is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  T_{SmoothAlg} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  SmoothAlg \times_{Ring} T_{Ring}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the strict [[pullback]] (i.e. taken in the 1-category [[Cat]]).

=--

We give the proof below. First some remarks and corollaries.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

We may regard an object in $T_{SmoothAlg}$ as a module over a [[smooth algebra]]. The above says in particular that modules over smooth algebras are just modules over the underlying ordinary rings. However, the category structure on $T_{SmoothAlg}$ does reflect that modules over smooth algebras have a different nature than just bare modules, notably in that the left adjoint to the projection $T_{SmoothAlg} \to SmoothAlg$ produces the correct $C^\infty$-[[derivation]]s and $C^\infty$-[[Kähler differential]]s (see there) as opposed to the purely algebraic ones.
 
=--

+-- {: .un_cor}
###### Corollary

For any category $S$ we have that 

$$
  (T_{SmoothAlg})^S \simeq
  SmoothAlg^S \times_{Ring^S} (T_{Ring})^S
  \,.
$$

So in particular for $S = \Delta$ the [[simplex category]] we have that [[simplicial object|simplicial]] modules over simplicial smooth algebras are as objects just ordinary simplicial modules over the underlying [[simplicial ring]]s.

=--

For proving the [above theorem](#TangentOfSmoothAlgTheorem) the main step is the following lemma. 

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For a fixed smooth algebra $R$, the [[forgetful functor]] 

$$
  U : Ab(SmoothAlg/R) \to Ab(Ring/U(R))
$$ 

is an [[equivalence of categories]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The statement was suggested at some point by [[Thomas Nikolaus]] in discussion with [[Urs Schreiber]], who then asked [[Herman Stel]] to prove it. A writeup is in ([Stel](#Stel)).

We discuss in detail that the functor is injective on objects, in that for an any abelian group object in $SmoothAlg/R$ its smooth algebra structure on the underlying ring structure is the _unique_ such smooth algebra that makes it an abelian group object over $R$. Whith this it is then easy to see that $U$ is in fact an isomorphism of categories.

The crucial property underlying this statement is that the [[Lawvere theory]] $T =$  [[CartSp]] over wich smooth algebras are $T$-algebras is in fact a [[Fermat theory]] in that [[Hadamard's lemma]] holds for [[smooth function]]s in particular on [[Cartesian space]]s.

This implies that for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and every smooth function $f : \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ there are [[smooth function]]s $\{h_{i,j} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R})\}_{i,j = 1}^n$ such that the function

$$
  f \circ + : \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}
$$

has an expansion given for all $p, w \in \mathbb{R}^k$ by

$$
  f(p+w) = f(p) + \sum_{l = 1}^k w_l \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_l}(p)
  + 
  \sum_{i,j}
   w_i \cdot w_j h_{i,j}(p,w)
  \,.
$$


We now use that any [[smooth algebra]] $A$ regarded as a product-preserving functor $A : CartSp \to Set$ reflects these relations in that for all $r, e \in A(k) = U(A)^k$ we have that

$$
  A(f)(r+e) 
  = 
  A(f)(r) + 
  \sum_{l = 1}^k w_l \cdot A\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_l}\right)(r)
  + 
  \sum_{i,j}
   e_i \cdot e_j A(h_{i,j})(r,e)
  \,.
$$

Now if $R \in SmoothAlg$  and $A$ is an object in $Ab(SmoothAlgebra/R)$ then in particular its underlying ring will be an object in $Ab(Ring/U(R))$. By the [above theorem](#OrdinaryModules) this means that the underlying ring is a square-zero-extension $U(R) \oplus N$ by some $N \in U(R) Mod$.

So it follows every element of $A(1)$ is of the form $(r, \epsilon)$ with $\epsilon \in N$ and we can always write it as 

$$
  (r,0) + (0, \epsilon) 
  \,.
$$

Moreover, since $A$ is by assumption a group object over $R$, it follows that for all $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k , \mathbb{R})$ and for all $r \in R(1)$ we have

$$
  A(f)(r) = R(f)(r)
  \,.
$$

So we only need to know how $A$ acts on mixed terms. The point now is that the above Hadamard-quotient formula reduces the action of any smooth function to just operations of this form $A(f)(r)$ and to ordinary multiplication and addition, so it actually fixes $A(f)$ from the restriction of $A(f)$ to elements of the form $(r,0)$ and the module structure on $N$:

$$
  A(f)(r +\epsilon)
  =
  A(f)(r) + 
  \sum_{l = 1}^k w_l \cdot A\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_l}\right)(r)
  + 
  0
$$

since $\epsilon_i \cdot \epsilon_j = 0$ in the underlying square-0-extension of $A$ and hence also in $A$.

In summary this shows that the forgetful functor $U$ is injective on objects. The above formula also directly implies, conversely, that the functor is surjective on objects, hence an isomorphism on objects, and moreover that it is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

Finally we come to the proof of the [full theorem above](#TangentOfSmoothAlgTheorem)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The above lemma shows that $T_{SmoothAlg} \simeq SmoothAlg \times_{Ring} T_{Ring}$ is a bijection on objects. 

To check bijection on corresponding [[hom-set]]s we again use the above Hadamard-quotient formula. (...)
