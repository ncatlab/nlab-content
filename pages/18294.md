## Idea

The term _transfinite arithmetic_ refers to [[arithmetic]] of quantities larger than the the finite [[natural numbers]], for instance _[[cardinal arithmetic]]_ is the arithmetic of [[cardinalities]] of [[sets]] possibly larger than that of [[finite sets]]. Similarly there is _[[ordinal arithmetic]]_.
