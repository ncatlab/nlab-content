
The term "logos" is used

* by [[Heraclitus]] for _[[logos (in philosophy)]]_, something that later was discussed as "logic" in [[Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_.

* in [Freyd-Scedrov](#FreydScedrov) as a synonym for _[[Heyting category]]_;

* in [Joyal 08](#Joyal08) as a synonym for _[[quasi-category]]_ ([[(∞,1)-category]], cf. also *[[Joyal locus]]*).

* In [Joyal 2015](#Joyal15) and [Anel–Joyal 2019](#AnelJoyal19) for an object of the opposite of the category of [[toposes]]. This works on the same lines as the duality between [[frames]] and [[locales]]. There is a [[higher category theory|higher]] version of logos, known as an $\infty$-logos.

* In [Anel 2019](#Anel19) for a cartesian closed [[(infinity,1)-category]] with finite limits and [[van Kampen colimits]] in size bounded by some [[inaccessible cardinal]].
