Let $C$ be a category. An object $x$ in $C$ is __compact__ if for every set $S$ of objects of $C$ such that the direct sum $\coprod_{s\in S} s$ exists, the canonical map
$$
\coprod_{s\in S} C(x,s)\to C(x,\coprod_{s\in S}s)
$$
is an isomorphism of sets. 

As every triangulated category is a plain additive category,
this notion is used in triangulated setup without change.

The notion can be modified to the categories enriched over a closed monoidal category (compare to the notions of finite and/or rigid objects in various contexts).
