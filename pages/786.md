A _weak equivalence_ is a [[morphism]] in a [[category]] $C$ which is supposed to be a true [[equivalence]] in a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] refinement of $C$.

The bare minimum of axioms to be satisfied by a weak equivalence are encoded in the concepts of [[category with weak equivalences]] and [[homotopical category]]. For such categories one can consider 

* the corresponding [[homotopy category]], which is the universal solution to turning all weak equivalences into [[isomorphism]]s;

* the corresponding [[(infinity,1)-category]] by [[Dwyer-Kan localization]], which is, roughly, the universal solution to turning all weak equivalences into higher categorical equivalences.

Important notions of categories with weak equivalences are [[model category]] and [[category of fibrant objects]].
