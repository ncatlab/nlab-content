A _weak equivalence_ is a [[morphism]] in a [[category]] $C$ which is supposed to be a true [[equivalence]] in a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] refinement of $C$.

For example, a weak equivalence between categories themselves is a functor that is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]; this is the proper notion to use even in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]] (but see [[equivalence]] for how to get around that).

The bare minimum of axioms to be satisfied by a weak equivalence are encoded in the concepts of [[category with weak equivalences]] and [[homotopical category]]. For such categories one can consider 

* the corresponding [[homotopy category]], which is the universal solution to turning all weak equivalences into [[isomorphism]]s;

* the corresponding [[(infinity,1)-category]] by [[Dwyer-Kan localization]], which is, roughly, the universal solution to turning all weak equivalences into higher categorical equivalences.

Important notions of categories with weak equivalences are [[model category]] and [[category of fibrant objects]].
