## Idea

The _model structure on strict $\omega$-categories_ is a [[model category]] structure that presentes the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[strict ω-categories]].

It resticts to the [[model structure on strict ω-groupoids]].

These structures also go by the name [[canonical model structure]] or [[folk model structure]].



## Properties

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

Every object is fibrant. The acyclic fibrations are precisely the functors that are [[k-surjective functor]]s for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

###### Theorem


The [[transferred model structure]] on [[StrωGrpd]] along the [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  U : Str \omega Grpd \to Str \omega Cat
$$

exists and coincides with the [[model structure on strict ω-groupoids]] defined in ([BrownGolasinski](#BrownGolasinski)).

This is proven in ([AraMetayer](#AraMetayer)).
