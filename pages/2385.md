## Idea 

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[D-geometry]], the _de Rham space_ $dR(X)$ of a [[space]] $X$ is the [[quotient]] of $X$ that identifies [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimally close points]].

## Definition 

### On $Rings^{op}$

Let [[CRing]] be the [[category]] of [[commutative ring]]s. For $R \in CRing$, write $I \in R$ for the [[nilradical]] of $R$, the [[ideal]] consisting of the nilpotent elements. The canonical projection $R \to R/I$ corresponds in the [[opposite category]] $Ring^{op}$ to the inclusion

$$
  Spec R/I \to Spec R
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

For $X \in PSh(Ring^{op})$ a [[presheaf]] on $Ring^{op}$ (for instance a [[scheme]]), its **de Rham space** $X_{dR}$ is the presheaf defined by

$$
  X_{dR} : Spec R \mapsto X(Spec R/I)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $X \in PSh(Ring^{op})$ is a [[smooth scheme]] then the canonical morphism

$$
  X \to X_{dR}
$$

is an [[epimorphism]] (hence an epimorphism over each $Spec R$) and therefore in this case $X_{dR}$ is the [[quotient]] of the relation "being infinitesimally close" between points of $X$: we have that $X_{dR}$ is the [[coequalizer]]

$$
  X_{dR} = \lim_\to 
   \left(
     X^{inf} \stackrel{\to}{\to} X
   \right)
  \,,
$$

of the two projections out of the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal.

### Crystalline site

For $X : Ring \to Set$ a [[scheme]], the [[big site]] $Ring^{op}/X_{dR}$
of $X_{dR}$, is the [[crystaline site]] of $X$.

### Grothendieck connection

Morphisms $X_{dR} \to Mod$ encode flat higher [[connection on a bundle|connections]]: [[local system]]s.

Accordingly, [[descent]] for deRham spaces -- sometimes called **deRham descent** encodes flat 1-connections. This is described at [[Grothendieck connection]], 

### D-modules

The category of [[D-module]]s on a [[space]] is equivalent to that of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on the corresponding deRham space. 

Accordingly, quasicoherent $\infty$-stacks on the full $\Pi^{inf}(X)$ encode a higher categorical version of this, as discussed at [[schreiber:∞-vector bundle]].
