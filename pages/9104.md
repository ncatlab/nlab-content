## Idea

A _Heisenberg $n$-group_ is a sub-[[∞-group]] of a [[quantomorphism n-group]] of a [[n-plectic geometry|n-plectic space]] $(G, \omega)$ equipped with [[∞-group]] structure, on those whose underlying [[n-plectomorphisms]] act  by lect [[∞-action]] of $G$ on itself. This is the higher refinement of the traditional notion of _[[Heisenberg group]]_.

## Definition

For $(G, \omega)$ an [[n-plectic geometry]] with [[higher geometric quantization|higher geometric prequantization]] $(G, \nabla)$ and for $G$ equipped with [[∞-group]] structure, the corresponding _Heisenberg $\infty$-group_ is the sub-[[∞-group]] of the [[quantomorphism n-group]] on those elements whose corresponding [[n-plectomorphism]] is given by such a left action.

The corresponding [[Lie n-algebra]] is the _[[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]]_.
