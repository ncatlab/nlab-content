##Idea##

The **simplex category** $\Delta$ encodes one of the main [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. Its objects are the standard cellular $n$-[[simplices]]. It is also called the _[[simplicial category]]_, but that term is ambiguous.

###### Definition

The **augmented simplex category** $\Delta_a$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the [[free categories]] of [[finite set|finite]] linear [[directed graphs]]

$$
  \{c_0 \to c_1 \to \cdots \to c_n\}
  \,.
$$

Equivalently this is the category whose [[objects]] are finite [[total order|totally ordered sets]], or finite ordinals, and whose [[morphisms]] are order-preserving functions between them.

###### Definition

The **simplex category** $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of $\Delta_a$ (and hence of $Cat$) consisting of the free categories on finite and **[[inhabited set|inhabited]]** directed graphs, hence of  _non-empty_ linear orders or _non-zero_ ordinals.

###### Remark

It is common, convenient and without risk to use a [[skeleton]] of $\Delta$ or $\Delta_a$, where we pick a fixed representative in each [[isomorphism class]]] of objects. Since isomorphisms of totally ordered sets are _unique_ this step is so trivial that it is often not even mentioned explicitly.

With this the objects of $\Delta$ are in bijection with [[natural numbers]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and one usually writes 

$$
  [n] = \{0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n\}
$$

for the object of $\Delta$ given by the category with $(n+1)$ [[object]]s. Geometrically one may think of this as the [[spine]] of the standard cellular $n$-[[simplex]], see the discussion of [simplicial sets](#SimplicialSets) below. In this context one also writes $\Delta[n]$ or $\Delta^n$ for the [[simplicial set]] [[representable functor|represented]] by the object $[n]$: the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]]. By the [[Yoneda lemma]] one may identify the subcategory of simplicial sets on the $\Delta[n]$ with $\Delta$.

With this convention the first few objects of $\Delta$ are

$$
  [0] = \{0\}
$$

$$
  [1] = \{0 \to 1\}
$$

$$
  [2] = \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}
$$

etc.

The category $\Delta_a$ contains one more object, corresponding to the empty category $\emptyset$. When sticking to the above standard notation for the objects of $\Delta$, that extra object is naturally often denoted 

$$
  [-1] = \emptyset
  \,.
$$ 

However, in contexts where only $\Delta_a$ and not $\Delta$ plays a role, some authors prefer to start counting with 0 instead of with $-1$. Then for instance the notation

$$
  \mathbf{0} = \emptyset
$$

$$
  \mathbf{1} = [0] =  \{0\}
$$

$$
  \mathbf{2} = [1]  = \{0 \to 1\}
$$

and generally

$$
  \mathbf{n} = [n-1]
$$

may be used.

###### Proposition

The [[skeleton|skeletal]] version of the **augmented simplex category** $\Delta_a$ can be presented as follows:

* objects are the finite totally ordered sets $\mathbf{n} := \{0 \lt 1 \lt  \cdots \lt n-1\}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

* morphisms  _generated_ by (are all expressible as finite compositions of) the following two elementary kinds of maps

  1. **face maps**: $\delta_i := \delta_i^n : \mathbf{n-1} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{n}$ is the injection whose image leaves out $i \in [n]$;

  1. **degeneracy maps**: $\sigma_i := \sigma_i^n : \mathbf{n+1} \to  \mathbf{n}$ is the surjection such that $\sigma_i(i) = \sigma_i(i+1) = i$;

subject to the following relations, called the **simplicial relations** or **[[simplicial identities]]**:

$$
  \array{
     \delta_j^{n+1} \circ \delta_i^n
     =
     \delta_i^{n+1}\circ \delta_{j-1}^n
     &
    \; i \lt j
     \\
     \sigma_j^n \circ \sigma_i^{n+1}
     =
     \sigma_i^{n-1} \circ \sigma_{j+1}^n
     &
     \; i \leq j
  }
$$
$$
  \sigma_j^n \circ \delta_i^{n+1}
  =
  \left\lbrace
    \array{
      \delta_i^n \circ \sigma_{j-1}^{n-1}
      &
       i \lt j
      \\
      Id_n & \; i = j \;or\; i = j+1
      \\
      \delta^n_{i-1} \circ \sigma_{j}^{n-1}
      &
       i \gt j +1
    }
  \right.
$$

## Properties

### Monoidal structure 
 {#ordinal sum}

The addition of [[natural number]]s extends to a [[functor]] $\oplus : \Delta_a \times \Delta_a \to \Delta_a$  and $\oplus : \Delta \times \Delta \to \Delta$, by taking $\mathbf{m} \oplus \mathbf{n}$ to be the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of $\mathbf{m}$ and $\mathbf{n}$, with the linear order that extends those on $\mathbf{m}$ and $\mathbf{n}$ by putting every element of $\mathbf{m}$ below every element of $\mathbf{n}$. This is called the _[[ordinal sum]]_ functor. If we visualise $\mathbf{n}$ as a totally ordered set $\{0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n-1\}$, and similarly for $\mathbf{m}$, then $\mathbf{m} \oplus \mathbf{n}$ looks like

$$
\mathbf{m} \oplus \mathbf{n} = \{0 \lt 1 \lt  \cdots \lt m-1 \lt 0^*\lt 1^* \lt \cdots \lt (n-1)^*\}
$$

where $k^*$ denotes $k$ considered as an element of $\mathbf{n}$.

Clearly $\oplus : \Delta_a \times \Delta_a \to \Delta_a$ acts on objects as
$$
  \mathbf{n} \oplus \mathbf{m} = \mathbf{n+m},
$$

On morphisms, given $f : \mathbf{m} \to \mathbf{m}'$ and $g : \mathbf{n} \to \mathbf{n}'$, we have 
$$
  (f\oplus g)(i) = \left\lbrace
     \array{
       f(i) & if \; 0 \leq i  \leq m - 1
       \\
       m' + g(i-m) & if \; m \leq i \leq (m+n-1)
     }
  \right.
  \,.
$$
so that $f \oplus g$ can be visualised as $f$ and $g$ placed side by side.

It is easy to see now that $(\Delta_a,\oplus,[0])$ is a [[strict monoidal category]].

It is important to note that this tensor does _not_ give a monoidal structure to $\Delta$, as that does not have the unit $\mathbf{0} = [-1] = \emptyset$.  

Under [[Day convolution]] this monoidal structure induces the [[join of simplicial sets]].

### $\Delta$ and $\Delta_a$ as 2-categories 


Being full subcategories of the [[2-category]] $Cat$, $\Delta$ and $\Delta_a$ are themselves 2-categories: their [[2-cell|2-cells]] $f \Rightarrow g$ are given by the pointwise order on monotone functions.  Equivalently, they are generated under (vertical and [[horizontal composition|horizontal]]) composition by the inequalities
$$ \delta^n_{i+1} \leq \delta^n_i \qquad \qquad \sigma^n_i \leq \sigma^n_{i+1} \, .$$
Of course, the ordinal sum functor $\oplus$ extends to a [[2-functor]] in the obvious way.

For each $n$ there is a string of [[adjunctions]]
$$
  \delta^n_{n-1} \dashv \sigma^n_{n-2} \dashv \delta^n_{n-2} \dashv
  \cdots \dashv \delta^n_1 \dashv \sigma^n_0 \dashv \delta^n_0
$$
where the counit of $\sigma_i \dashv \delta_i$ and the unit of $\delta_{i+1} \dashv \sigma_i$ are identities.

For each $n \geq 2$, the object $\mathbf{n+1}$ is given by the [[pushout]]
$$
\array{
\mathbf{n-1} & \overset{\delta_0}{\to} & \mathbf{n} \\
\mathllap{\scriptsize{\delta_{n-1}}} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\scriptsize{\delta_0}} \\
\mathbf{n} & \underset{\delta_0}{\to} & \mathbf{n+1}
}
$$

This means that $\Delta_a$ is generated as a 2-category by these pushouts and by taking adjoints of morphisms.  Its monoidal structure is also determined in this way: for each $n$, write $\bot_n = \delta_{n-1}\cdots\delta_2\delta_1$ for the (morphism $\mathbf{1} \to \mathbf{n}$ corresponding to the) least element $0$ of $\mathbf{n}$, and $\top_n = \delta_0\cdots\delta_0\delta_0$ for the greatest.  Then there are [[cospans]] $\mathbf{1} \to \mathbf{n} \leftarrow \mathbf{1}$ given by $\top_n$ and $\bot_n$, and each such is equivalent to the $(n-1)$ fold cospan composite (i.e. pushout) of $\mathbf{1} \to \mathbf{2} \leftarrow \mathbf{1}$ with itself.  The ordinal sum $\mathbf{n} \oplus \mathbf{m}$ is given by the composite
$$
\array{
  & & & & \mathbf{n} \oplus \mathbf{m} & & & & \\
  & & & \nearrow & & \nwarrow & & & \\
  & & \mathbf{n} & & & & \mathbf{m} & & \\
  & \nearrow & & \nwarrow & & \nearrow & & \nwarrow & \\
  \mathbf{1} & & & & \mathbf{1} & & & & \mathbf{1}
}
$$
The universal property of pushouts, together with those of the initial and terminal objects $\mathbf{0},\mathbf{1}$, then suffices to define $\oplus$ as a 2-functor.

### Universal properties 

The morphisms $\mathbf{0} \overset{\delta_0}{\to} \mathbf{1} \overset{\sigma_0}{\leftarrow} \mathbf{2}$ in $\Delta_a$ make $\mathbf{1}$ into a [[monoid object]].  Indeed, it is easy to see that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\delta^n_i & = \mathbf{i} \oplus \delta^0_0 \oplus \mathbf{n-i} \\
\sigma^n_i & = \mathbf{i} \oplus \sigma^1_0 \oplus \mathbf{n-i-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
so that the morphisms of $\Delta_a$ are generated under $\circ$ and $\oplus$ by $\delta^0_0$ and $\sigma^1_0$, together with exactly the equations needed to make them the structure maps of the monoid $[1]$.  The objects of $\Delta_a$ are the elements of the free monoid generated by $\mathbf{1}$ and $\oplus$.

$\Delta_a$ thus becomes the universal category-equipped-with-a-monoid, in the sense that for any strict monoidal category $B$, there is a bijection between monoids $(M,m,e)$ in $B$ and strict [[monoidal functors]] $\Delta_a \to B$ such that $\mathbf{1} \mapsto M$, $\sigma_0 \mapsto m$ and $\delta_0 \mapsto e$.

In particular, for $K$ a 2-category, [[monads]] in $K$ correspond to 2-functors $\mathbf{B}\Delta_a \to K$, where $\mathbf{B}\Delta_a$ is $\Delta_a$ considered as a one-object 2-category.  Because monads in $K$ are also the same as [[lax functors]] $1 \to K$, this correspondence exhibits $\mathbf{B}\Delta_a$ as the [[lax morphism classifier]] for the terminal category $1$.

When $\Delta_a$ is considered as a 2-category, a similar argument to the above shows that the one-object [[3-category]] $\mathbf{B}\Delta_a$ classifies [[lax-idempotent monads]]: given a 3-category $M$ and a lax-idempotent monad $t$ therein, there is a unique 3-functor $\mathbf{B}\Delta_a \to M$ sending $[1]$ to $t$, essentially because $\sigma^1_0 \dashv \delta^1_0 = \delta^0_0 \oplus \mathbf{1}$ with identity counit.

### Simplicial sets 
 {#SimplicialSets}

[[presheaf|Presheaves]] on $\Delta$ are [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]]. Presheaves on $\Delta_a$ are **[[augmented simplicial sets]]..

Under the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y : \Delta \to $ [[SSet]] the object $[n]$ induces the standard simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $Y([n]) =: \Delta^n$. So 
in particular we have $(\Delta^n)[m] = Hom_{\Delta}([m],[n])$ and hence 
$\Delta^n[m]$ is a finite set with $\binom{n+m+1}{n}$ elements. 

The face and degeneracy maps and the relation they satisfy are geometrically best understood in terms of the [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] image under $Y$ in [[SSet]]: 

* the face map $Y(\delta_i) : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}$ injects the standard simplicial $(n-1)$-simplex as the $i$th face into the standard simplicial $n$-simplex;

* the degeneracy map $Y(\sigma_i) : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^{n}$ projects the standard simplicial $(n+1)$-simplex onto the standard simplicial $n$-simplex by collapsing its vertex number $i$ onto the face opposite to it.


### Realization and nerve
 {#RealizationAndNerve}

There are important standard functors from $\Delta$ to other categories which _[[nerve and realization|realize]]_ $[n]$ as a concrete model of the standard $n$-[[simplex]]. 

* The functor $\Delta[-] : \Delta \to $ [[sSet]] (the [[Yoneda embedding]]) realizes $[n]$ as a [[simplicial set]].


* The functor $|\cdot| : \Delta \to $ [[Top]]

  sends $[n]$ to the standard topological $n$-simplex $[n] \mapsto \{x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_n \leq 1\}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. This functor induced [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]].

* The functor $O : \Delta \to Str\omega Cat $
  sends $[n]$ to the $n$th [[oriental]]. This induces simplicial [[nerves]] of [[omega-category|omega-categories]].

  Under the functor $Str \omega Cat \to Cat$ which discards all higher morphisms and identifies all 1-morphisms that are connected by a 2-morphisms, this becomes again the identification of $\Delta$ with the full subbcategory of $Cat$ on linear [[quivers]] that we started the above definition with

  $$
    [n] \mapsto \{0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n\}
    \,.
  $$
