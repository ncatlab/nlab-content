## Idea

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[topological space|topological]] [[n-sphere]] regarded as a [[Riemannian manifold]] in the standard way (i.e. as the [[submanifold]] of elements at constant [[distance]] from a given point in [[Euclidean space]]) is also called the _round $n$-sphere_, in order to distinguish it from other, inequivalent, Riemannian manifold [[structures]] that also exists on [[topological space|topological]] [[n-sphere]]. These alternatives are then also called _[[squashed spheres]]_.
