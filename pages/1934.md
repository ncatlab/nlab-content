## Idea

Recall that a [[Grothendieck topos]] $T$ is a [[category of sheaves]] $T = Sh(S)$ on some [[site]] $S$.

If $S = Op(X)$ is the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]] $X$ (or some [[manifold]] or the like) then one calls $T$ a **petit topos**. 

If $S$ on the other hand is a category of _all test [[space]]s_ in some sense, such as

* the category [[Top]] of all [[topological space]]s;

* the category [[Diff]] of all smooth [[manifold]]s

etc. one call $T$ a **gros topos** .

Objects in a gros topos may be thought of as [[space]]s _modeled on $S$_ in the sense described at [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]].

Also the objects in a petit topos $Sh(Op(X))$ are a kind of generalized spaces, but generalized spaces _over $X$_ on which the rigid structure of morphisms in $Op(X)$ (only inclusions of subsets, no more general maps) induces a correspondingly rigid structure so that they are not all that general. In fact, $Sh(Op(X))$ is equivalent to [[etale space]]s over $X$.


## Examples

For instance if $S = $ [[Diff]] we may think of objects in $Sh(Diff)$ as [[smooth space]]s and of objects in the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] on $S$ as [[smooth infinity-stack]]s.
