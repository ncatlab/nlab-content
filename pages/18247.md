## Idea

A _fractal_ is a [[space]] of sorts which is self-similar, to some extent, under rescalings.

There is a concept of [[fractal dimension]] which measures how the amount of detail of a given space changes with scale. For ordinary [[manifolds]] this fractal dimension coincides with the usual [[dimension]], taking values in tha [[natural numbers]]. For fractal spaces however the fractal dimension may be a [[rational number]], hence a [[fraction]] of natural number, whence the name "fractal"

## Examples

* [[Cantor space]]

* [[Mandelbrot set]]

* [[Julia set]]

## Related concepts

* [[conformal invariance]]
