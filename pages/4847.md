## Definition


For $Aut(\{1, \cdots , n\}) \simeq S_n$ the [[symmetric group]] on $n \in \mathbb{N}$ elements, the _signature_ is the unique [[group]] [[homomorphism]]

$$
  sign : S_n \to \mathbb{Z}_2 = \{1, -1\}
$$

that sends each transposition $s_{i, i+1} : \{1, \cdots, n\} \to \{1, \cdots, n\}$, which interchanges the $i$th element with its neighbour and leaves the other elements fixed, to the nontrivial element $(-1) \in \mathbb{Z}_2$. 

Permutations in the kernel of $sign$ are called _even_ permutations, and the rest are called _odd_ permutations.

###### Proof 
One way of seeing this is invoking a standard [[group presentation]] of $S_n$ where generators $\sigma_i$ for $i = 1$ to $n-1$ (representing $s_{i, i+1}$) are subject to relations 

$$\sigma_{i}^2 = 1, \qquad (\sigma_i \sigma_{i+1})^3 = 1, \qquad \sigma_i \sigma_j = \sigma_j \sigma_i \; ({|i-j|} \gt 1),$$ 

and checking that the sign applied to both sides of a relation equation gives the same result. 

Another is by invoking a tautological representation of $S_n$ on a [[polynomial algebra]] $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, 

$$S_n \stackrel{\cong}{\to} Set(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}, \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}) \to CRing(\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n], \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n])$$ 

and recognizing that for the special polynomial 

$$D \coloneqq \prod_{i \lt j} (x_i - x_j)$$ 

we have, for each permutation $\tau$, either $\tau \cdot D = D$ or $\tau \cdot D = -D$. (The polynomial $\Delta \coloneqq D^2$, which is invariant under the action, is called the [[discriminant]].)

## Computations 

There are various means for computing the signature (also called **sign**) of a permutation. 

The definition itself suggests one method: if we linearly [[total order|order]] the set $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ by $x_1 \lt \ldots \lt x_n$, then we can exhibit a permutation $\tau$ by a [[string diagram]] and simply count the number of crossings $I(\tau)$; then we have 

$$sign(\tau) = (-1)^{I(\tau)}.$$ 

Each crossing corresponds to a pair of elements $x_i \lt x_j$ such that $\tau(x_i) \gt \tau(x_j)$, called an **inversion**. 

Another method which does not depend on choosing a total order is to exhibit a permutation through its [cycle decomposition](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/permutation#via_cycle_decompositions_6). Each cycle of period $k$ contributes a sign $(-1)^{k-1}$, and the overall sign is the product of these contributions taken over all the cycles.
