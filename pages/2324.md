[[!redirects affine schemes]]

An __affine scheme__ is a [[scheme]] that as a [[sheaf]] on the [[opposite category]] [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ of commutative [[ring]]s (or equivalently as a sheaf on the subcategory of finitely presented rings) is [[representable functor|representable]]. In a [[ringed space]] picture an affine scheme is a [[locally ringed space]] which is locally isomorphic to the [[prime spectrum]] of a commutative ring. Affine schemes form a full subcategory $Aff\hookrightarrow Scheme$ of the category of schemes.

The correspondence $Y\mapsto Spec(\Gamma_Y \mathcal{O}_Y)$ extends to a functor $Scheme\to Aff$. The __fundamental theorem on morphisms of schemes__ says that there is a bijection  

$$
CRing(\Gamma_Y\mathcal{O}_Y, R) \cong Scheme(Spec R, Y).
$$

In other words, for fixed $Y$, and for varying $R$ there is a restricted functor  

$$ Scheme(-,Y)|_{Aff^{op}} = h_Y|_{Aff^{op}} = h_Y|_{CRing} : CRing\to Set,$$ 

and the functor $Y\mapsto h_Y|_{CRing}$ from schemes to presheaves on $Aff$ is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]. Thus the general schemes if defined as ringed spaces, indeed form a full subcategory of the category of presheaves on $Aff$. 

There is an analogue of this theorem for relative [[noncommutative scheme]]s in the sense of Rosenberg. 

#### Relative affine schemes

A __relative affine scheme__ over a scheme $Y$ is a [[relative scheme]]  $f:X\to Y$ isomorphic to the spectrum of a (commutative unital) algebra $A$ in the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}_Y$-modules; such a "relative" spectrum has been introduced by Grothendieck. It is characterized by the property that for every open $V\subset Y$ the inverse image $f^{-1}V\subset X$ is an open affine subscheme of $X$ isomorphic to $Spec(A(V))$ and such open affines glue in such a way that $f^{-1}V\hookrightarrow f^{-1}W$ corresponds to the restriction morphism $A(W)\to A(V)$ of algebras. 

Relative affine scheme is a concrete way to represent an [[affine morphism]] of schemes. 

#### [[affine Serre's theorem|Affine Serre's theorem]]

Given a commutative unital ring $R$ there is an equivalence of categories
${}_R Mod\to Qcoh(Spec R)$ between the category of $R$-modules and the category of quasicoherent sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_{Spec R}$-modules given on objects by $M\mapsto \tilde{M}$ where $\tilde{M}$ is the unique sheaf such that the restriction on the principal Zariski open subsets is given by the localization $\tilde{M}(D_f) = R[f^{-1}]\otimes_R M$ where  $D_f$ is the principal Zariski open set underlying $Spec R[f^{-1}]\subset Spec R$, and the restrictions are given by the canonical maps among the localizations. The action of $\mathcal{O}_{Spec R}$ is defined using a similar description of $\mathcal{O}_{Spec R} = \tilde{R}$. Its right adjoint (quasi)inverse functor is given by the global sections functor $\mathcal{F}\mapsto\mathcal{F}(Spec R)$.
