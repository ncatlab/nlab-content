## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[quantum physics]], *braid group statistics* or *anyon statistics* refers to an exotic phenomenon where the [[braiding]] of the [[worldlines]] of certain effective [[particles]] ("anyons") in an effectively 2+1-dimensional [[spacetime]] has the effect of transforming the [[quantum state]] of the total [[quantum system]] by [[unitary operators]] which constitute a [[linear representation]] of the [[braid group]] -- a *[[braid representation]]*.

Often this is motivated as a generalization of the [[boson]]- or [[fermion]]-"statistics" which enters the *[[spin-statistics theorem]]*, see [below](#AsGeneralizedBosonFermionStatistics). But in reality this effect is often encountered not for fundamental [[particles]]/quanta, but for *[[soliton|solitonic]]$\;$[[defects]]*, see [further below](#AsBraidingOfDefects).

The concept of anyons is particularly well motivated in [[solid state physics]], where effectively 2-dimensional [[quantum materials]] are common place (eg. [[graphene]]) or where particles may otherwise be constrained to move in a [[plane]], such as in the [[quantum Hall effect]]. There is a multitude of *[[model (in theoretical physics)|models]]* in [[condensed matter theory]] (mostly [[lattice models]], such as [[string-net models]]) which *theoretically* realize anyon braid group statistics, and there are some first [[experiment|experimental]] indications of anyonic phenomena in actual materials (see the references under *[Experimental Realization](#ExperimentalRealization)*) below.

Specifically, in the context of [[topological phases of matter]], the (potential) presence of anyons has come to be known as the case of *[[topological order]]*, see there for more. 

Besides general curiosity, much of the interest in anyonic braid group statistics lies in the fact that these [[braid representations]] are imagined to potentially serve as [[quantum gates]] in [[topological quantum computers]]. See there for more.


### As generalized boson/fermion statistics
 {#AsGeneralizedBosonFermionStatistics}

In [[quantum field theory]], one speaks of the "statistics" of a [[particle]] species when referring to the [[linear representation]] that $n$-particle [[wavefunctions]] form under the the [[symmetric group]] $Sym(n)$ which [[permutation|permutes]] the $n$ particles.

While there is a rich [[representation theory of the symmetric group]],
the [[spin-statistics theorem]] says, when it applies, that for *[[field (physics)|field]] quanta* only the simplest two possibilities may occur:

* [[bosons]] (such as [[photons]]) transform under the [[trivial representation]] of $Sym(n)$,

* [[fermions]] (such as [[electrons]]) transform under the [[sign representation]] of $Sym(n)$.

  (see also at *[[Slater determinant]]*)

Now, the [[braid group]] on $n$ strands covers the symmetric group

$$
  Br(n)
  \twoheadrightarrow
  Sym(n)
$$

which allows one to regard any [[linear representation]] of the symmetric group also as a particular [[braid group representation]]. But by its definition, the [[braid group]] may be understood as the group of [[isotopy]]-classes of [[disjoint union|disjoint]] [[timelike]] [[worldlines]] in an effectively 2+1 dimensional [[spacetime]], with the group operation being [[concatenation]] of worldlines.

In this sense, one may imagine that *any* [[braid group representations]] may generalize the boson/fermion statistics in 2+1 dimensions. Texts typically suggest that this applies to *[[quasiparticle|quasiparticles]]*. 

The term *anyon* is a pun on this state of affairs that *any* statistics "in between" boson- and fermion-statistics may be allowed.




### As braiding of defects
 {#AsBraidingOfDefects}

In contrast to the traditional motivation [above](#AsGeneralizedBosonFermionStatistics), many (most?) incarnations of the concept of anyons are [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[soliton|solitonic]] [[defects]] (of [[codimension]]=2), akin to *[[vortices]]* in fluids. 

>  Anyons can arise in two ways: as localised excitations of an interacting
quantum Hamiltonian or as defects in an ordered system.  $[$[Das Sarma, Freedman & Nayak 2015](topological+quantum+computation#DasSarmaFreedmanNayak15)$]$

The effect of braiding of [[defects]] in [[quantum materials]] has been understood and discussed before the term "anyon" became established: [Mermin 1979](#Mermin79), [Lo & Preskill 1993](#LoPreskill93).

> Anyonic particles are best viewed as a kind of topological defects that reveal non-trivial properties of the ground state. $[$p. 4$]$. $[$[Kitaev 2006](#Kitaev06)$]$

A concrete example of defect anyons are [[vortex]] anyons see [below](#VortexAnyons).

Of course, the notion of codimension=2 defects subsumes situations that are quite different from the [[quasiparticle]]-excitations imagined in traditional texts on anyons, such as:

* [anyonic band nodes](#AnyonicBandNodes)

* [defect branes](#DefectBranes).

#### Vortex anyons
 {#VortexAnyons}

Specifically, *[[vortex]] anyons* are realized in [[Bose-Einstein condensates]] ([MPSS19](#MPSS19), following [PFCZ01](#PFCZ01)) and in (other) [[superfluids]] ([MMN21](#MMN21)).

#### Anyonic band nodes?
 {#AnyonicBandNodes}

Around 2020 the view has been emerging that also defects "in momentum/reciprocal space" may behave as anyonic defects under braiding in momentum space. This applies concretely to nodal points (where [[electron bands]] touch or cross) in the momentum space [[Brillouin torus]] of [[topological semi-metals]]:

> here are band crossing points, henceforth called [[vortices]] $[$[Ahnm Park & Yang 2019](#AhnParkYang19)$]$

> a new type non-Abelian "braiding" of nodal-line rings inside the momentum space $[$[Tiwari & Bzdušek 2020](#TiwariBzdusek20)$]$

Curiously, these reciprocal/momemtum space anyons lend themselves to tractable laboratory manipulation in a way that has remained notoriously elusive for "position space" anyons:

> Our work opens up routes to readily manipulate Weyl nodes using only slight external parameter changes, paving the way for the practical realization of reciprocal space braiding $[$[CBSM22](#CBSM22)$]$,

specifically

> it is possible to controllably braid Kagome band nodes in monolayer $\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ using strain and/or an external electric field $[$[PBMS22](#PBMS22)$]$,

leading to:

> new opportunities for exploring non-Abelian braiding of band crossing points (nodes) in reciprocal space, providing an alternative to the real space braiding exploited by other strategies. 

> Real space braiding is practically constrained to boundary states, which has made experimental observation and manipulation difficult; instead, reciprocal space braiding occurs in the bulk states of the band structures and we demonstrate in this work that this provides a straightforward platform for non-Abelian braiding. $[$[PBSM22](#PBSM22)$]$.





#### Defect branes
 {#DefectBranes}

In [[string theory]], *[[defect branes]]* are [[D-branes]] or [[M-branes]] of [[codimension]]=2, such as [[D7-branes]] in [[type IIB string theory]] or [[M5-brane]]-[[brane intersection|intersections]] on "[[3-brane in 6d|M3-branes]]" in [[M-theory]]. 

It has been suggest in [deBoer & Shigemori 2012, p. 65](defect+brane#deBoerShigemori12) that these could behave like anyons. This is further substantiated in [SS22](defect+brane#SS22). See [there](defect+brane#RelationToAnyons) for more.

### Experimental detection of anyons
 {#ExperimentalRealization}


While the occurrence of [[anyon]]-excitations in the [[quantum Hall effect]] is a robust theoretical prediction (see the references [above](#AnyonsInTheQuantumHallEffectReferences)), and while the quantum Hall effect itself has long been established in [[experiment]], the actual observation of anyons in these systems is subtle:

An early claim of the observation of non-abelian anyons seems to remain unconfirmed:

* Sanghun An, P. Jiang, H. Choi, W. Kang, S. H. Simon, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. West, K. W. Baldwin, _Braiding of Abelian and Non-Abelian Anyons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect_ ([arXiv:1112.3400](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3400))

The claimed observation of abelian anyons is apparently more securely established:
