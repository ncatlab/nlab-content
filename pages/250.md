## Idea

The concept _algebroid_ is the [[horizontal categorification|many object version]] (or oidification)  of the concept _[[unital associative algebra]]_.



## Definition

An **algebroid** is a [[category]] [[enriched category|enriched over]] ([[Vect]],$\otimes$).


This is also called a [[linear category]].


## Remarks

* An [[unital associative algebra|algebra]] is an algebroid with a single object. Hence a one-object $Vect$-enriched category. See [[horizontal categorification]].

* Compare with similar '[[oidification|oidfied]]' concepts such as [[groupoid]] and [[ringoid]].

* Beware that a [[Lie algebroid]] is not a special case of an algebroid in the above sense, just as a [[Lie algebra]] is not a [[unital associative algebra]]. The point is that there is a restrictive and a general sense of "algebra". In the restrictive sense an algebra is an associative unital algebra, hence a [[monoid]] in $Vect$, hence a one-object $Vect$-enriched category. But in a more general sense an algebra is an algebra over an [[operad]]. It is this more general sense in terms of which Lie algebras are special cases of algebras and [[Lie algebroid]]s their [[horizontal categorification]].


## Generalizations

* Replacing plain vector spaces with [[chain complexes]] of vector spaces leads to an $\infty$-version of algebroids: a category enriched in chain complexes, which following the above reasoning could justly be called a _DG algebroid_  is usually called a _[[DG-category]]_.

* Replacing plain vector spaces with [[Banach space]]s leads to a $C^*$-version of algebroids: a category enriched in Banach spaces with some extra structure (mimicing the extra structure of a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]), which following the above reasoning could justly be call a _$C^*$-algebroid_ is usually called a $C^*$-category. See [[spaceoid]]s.
