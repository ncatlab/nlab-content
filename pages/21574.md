\section{Idea}

Just as the category [[Cat]] of categories can be equipped with a [[canonical model structure]], namely the [[canonical model structure on categories]], so too can [[2Cat]], the category of strict 2-categories. This extends to weak 2-categories too, although in order to actually have a [[category]] on which to put the model structure, one has to work with [[strict 2-functor|strict 2-functors]]. 

The characterising feature of a canonical model structure on [[2Cat]] is that the weak equivalences should be [[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalences of 2-categories]], more specifically [[strict equivalence of 2-categories|strict equivalences of 2-categories]], categorifying the fact that the equivalences in the [[canonical model structure on categories]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalences of categories]]. What the fibrations and cofibrations should be, or more specifically how to categorify [[isofibration|isofibrations]] and [[iso-cofibration|iso-cofibrations]], is one of the main points to resolve to obtain the model structure.

What is usually referred to as the canonical model structure on 2-categories is a model structure first described by [[Stephen Lack|Lack]] in [Lack2002](#Lack2002) and [Lack2004](#Lack2004). In this model structure, the fibrations are [[Lack fibration|Lack fibrations]], and every object is [[fibrant object|fibrant]], but not every object is [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]], in contrast to the [[canonical model structure on categories]].

However, it is possible to put a different canonical model structure on [[2Cat]] in which every object is both fibrant and cofibrant, using the thesis [Williamson2011](#Williamson2011). The fibrations in this case are, roughly speaking, those [[2-functor|2-functors]] in which [[semi-strict equivalence|semi-strict equivalences]] can be lifted. 

\section{Lack model structure}

The following is Theorem 4 in [Lack2004](#Lack2004).

\begin{thm} There is a model structure on [[2Cat]] in which the equivalences are [[strict equivalence of 2-categories|strict equivalences of 2-categories]], and the fibrations are [[Lack fibration|Lack fibrations]]. \end{thm}

\section{Canonical model structure in which every object is both fibrant and cofibrant}

Throughout this section, let $\mathcal{E}_{semi}$ denote the [[free-standing semi-strict equivalence]]. 

\begin{defn} A _semi-strict equiv-fibration_ is a [[2-functor]] $p: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ such that, for any (strictly) commutative diagram 

\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{X} \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, swap, "id \times 0"] & \mathcal{A} \ar[d, "p"] \\
\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \ar[r, swap, "g"] & \mathcal{B}  
\end{tikzcd}

in [[2Cat]], there is a functor $l: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ such that the following diagram in [[2Cat]] (strictly) commutes.

\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{X} \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, swap, "id \times 0"] & \mathcal{A} \ar[d, "p"] \\
\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \ar[r, swap, "g"] \ar[ur, "l"] & \mathcal{B}  
\end{tikzcd}

\end{defn}

\begin{defn} A _semi-strict equiv-cofibration_ is a [[2-functor]] $j: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ such that, for any (strictly) commutative diagram 

\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{A} \ar[r, "id \times 0"] \ar[d, swap, "j"] & \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \ar[d, "h"] \\
\mathcal{B} \ar[r, swap, "f"] & \mathcal{X}  
\end{tikzcd}

in [[2Cat]], there is a functor $k: \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ such that the following diagram in [[2Cat]] (strictly) commutes.

\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{A} \ar[r, "id \times 0"] \ar[d, swap, "j"] & \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \ar[d, "j \times id"] \ar[ddr, bend left, "h"] & \\
\mathcal{B} \ar[r, swap, "id \times 0"] \ar[drr, swap, bend right, "f"] & \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \ar[dr, "k"] & \\
& & \mathcal{X}  
\end{tikzcd}

\end{defn}

\begin{defn} A [[2-functor]] $f: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a _semi-strict equivalence of 2-categories_Â if there is a 2-functor $h: \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{E}_{semi} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ such that the 2-functor $h \circ \left( id \times 0 \right): \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is equal to $f$. \end{defn}

\begin{thm} The category [[2Cat]] can be equipped with a model structure in which the weak equivalences are semi-strict equivalences of 2-categories, the fibrations are semi-strict equiv-fibrations, and the cofibrations are semi-strict equiv-cofibrations. \end{thm} 

\begin{proof} By the section 'Structured interval' of the page [[walking equivalence]], $\mathcal{E}_{semi}$ can be equipped with the structure of an [[interval object]], and embellished with all the structures of [Williamson2011](#Williamson2011) which are required for Corollary XV.6 and/or Corollary XV.7 of this work, satisfying all the hypotheses of these corollaries. Applying these corollaries, we immediately obtain the theorem. \end{proof}
