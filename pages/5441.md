## Idea 

An _Artin stack_ is a [[geometric stack]] over the [[étale site]]: the [[stack]] quotient of a [[scheme]] whose [[automorphism group]]s are [[algebraic group]]s.

This is the general notion of [[algebraic stack]]. But often the latter term is used in a more restrictive sense to mean [[Deligne-Mumford stack]].

## Properties

* [[Artin representability theorem]]

## References

Artin stacks are named after [[Michael Artin]].
