As a [[category]], $n Cob$ has $(n-1)$-dimensional [[compact space|compact]] [[orientation|oriented]] [[manifolds]] as [[objects]] and $n$-dimensional oriented [[cobordisms]] between these as [[morphisms]].  It plays a fundamental role in [[TQFT]].

For some purposes, we want $n Cob$ to be an [[n-category]], but this is less well understood.
