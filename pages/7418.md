## Definition

An **elegant Reedy category** is a [[Reedy category]] $R$ such that

* every [[span]] of codegeneracy maps in $R$ has an [[absolute colimit|absolute]] [[pushout]] in $R$ that also consists of codegeneracy maps.

In particular, this implies that every codegeneracy map is a [[split epimorphism]].

## Model structures

###### Theorem
If $R$ is an elegant Reedy category and $M$ is a [[model category]] in which the [[cofibrations]] are exactly the [[monomorphisms]], then the [[Reedy model structure]] and the [[injective model structure]] on $M^{R^{op}}$ coincide.
