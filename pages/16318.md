## Idea

In [[physics]], the _exclusion principle_ states that no two [[fermions]] may inhabit the same [[quantum state]]. This is named after [[Wolfgang Pauli]].

Mathematically this is the statement that fermion [[field (physics)|fields]] are the odd-graded elements of a [[superalgebra]] of functions in [[supergeometry]].

The Pauli exclusion principle is a consequence of the _[[spin-statistics theorem]]_.

The Pauli exclusion principle implies that [[fermions]], as opposed to [[bosons]], may form [[solidity|solid bodies]] that do not necessarily collapse under their own [[gravity]] (as opposed to bosonic [[condensates]]): the exclusion principle induces an outward [[pressure]], the _[[degeneracy pressure]]_ (see also at _[[Fermi sea]]_ and _[[neutron star]]_). It is used in the explanation of the [[stability of matter]] of the second kind.
