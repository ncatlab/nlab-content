A **Fuchsian (differential) equation** is a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with analytic coefficients in the complex domain whose singular points, including at infinity, are all [[regular singular point]]s. In other words, it is the 1-dimensional case of the theory of meromorphic differential equations with only regular singular points. [[Riemann-Hilbert problem|Hilbert's 21st problem]] is concerned with finding a Fuchsian equation with prescribed points of singularities and prescribed [[monodromies]]. The corresponding connection is also called Fuchsian.
