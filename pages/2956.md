## Idea 

The _Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis_ states that for all $k = n+2$ a [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] is "maximally monoidal".  In other words, for $k \geq n + 2$, a $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category is the same thing as an $(n+2)$-tuply monoidal $n$-category.  More precisely, the natural inclusion $k Mon n Cat \hookrightarrow (n+2) Mon n Cat$ is an [[equivalence of higher categories]].


## Proof for $(n,1)$-categories

An aspect of the proof of this for [[(n,1)-categories]] was demonstrated in 

* [[Carlos Simpson]], _On the Breen-Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis for Tamsamani's weak $n$-categories_ ([arXiv:math/9810058](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810058))

in terms of [[Tamsamani n-categories]].


A proof of the full statement in terms of [[quasi-categories]] is sketched in
[section 43.5](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/IMA/Joyal.pdf#page=187) of 

* [[Andr√© Joyal]], _Notes on quasi-categories_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/IMA/Joyal.pdf)).

An argument is also given in example 1.2.3 of

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Ek-Algebras]]_ .
