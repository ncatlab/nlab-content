## Idea

A [[function]] or [[differential form]] on a [[manifold with boundary]] to a is said to have _sitting instants_ at the boundary if there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $\partial X \subset U \subset X$ of the boundary such that the [[restriction]] $f|_U$ of $f$ to that neighbourhood is [[locally constant map|locally constant]] in the direction perpendicular to the boundary.
