## Definition

A [[continuous map]] $f\colon X \to Y$ from a [[manifold with boundary]] to a [[space]] $Y$ is said to have **sitting instants** if there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $\partial X \subset U \subset X$ of the boundary such that the [[restriction]] $f|_U$ of $f$ to that neighbourhood is [[locally constant map|locally constant]] (constant on each connected component).
