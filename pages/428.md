## Idea 

The **bar construction** takes a [[monad]] $(T, \mu, \epsilon)$ equipped with an [[algebra over a monad|algebra-over-a-monad]] $(A, \rho)$ to the ([[augmented simplicial set|augmented]]) [[simplicial object]] whose structure maps are given by the structure maps of the monad and its action on its algebra:

$$
  \mathrm{B}(T,A)
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \cdots
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
    T T A
    \stackrel{\stackrel{\mu \cdot Id_A}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{T \cdot \rho}{\longrightarrow}}
    T A \stackrel{\rho}{\longrightarrow} A
  \right)
    \,.
$$

This simplicial object can be viewed as a [[resolution]] of $A$, in a sense explained below. 

## Definition 

Let $\mathbf{E}$ be a [[category]] and let $(T, m: T T \to T, u: 1_{\mathbf{E}} \to T)$ be a monad on $\mathbf{E}$. We let $\mathbf{E}^T$ denote the category of $T$-[[algebra over a monad|algebras]], and $U: \mathbf{E}^T \to \mathbf{E}$ the [[forgetful functor]] which is [[monadic functor|monadic]], with [[left adjoint]] $F$. 

Recall that the (augmented) [[simplex category]], viz. the category consisting of finite [[ordinals]][^fine] and order-preserving maps, is the "[[walking structure|walking]] [[monoid]]", i.e., is initial among strict [[monoidal categories]] equipped with a monoid object. The monoidal product on $\Delta$ is ordinal addition $[m]+[n] = [m+n]$. If $[n]$ is the $n$-element ordinal, then the terminal object $[1]$ carries a unique monoid structure and represents the "generic monoid"[^fine]. 

[^fine]: N.B.: including the empty ordinal. 

[^fine]: If $X: \Delta^{op} \to C$ is a simplicial object, then $X([n])$ is what is usually denoted $X_{n-1}$, the object of cells in dimension $n-1$. Note that $X([0]) = X_{-1}$ is the augmented component. The $n$ can be thought of as the number of vertices of a simplex of dimension $n-1$. We choose the index $n$ over the geometric dimension $n-1$ as it is more convenient for our purposes. 

Similarly $\Delta^{op}$ is the walking [[comonoid]]. Since the [[comonad]] $F U$ on $\mathbf{E}^T$ can be regarded as a comonoid in the strict monoidal category of endofunctors $[\mathbf{E}^T, \mathbf{E}^T]$ (with endofunctor composition as monoidal product), there is a unique monoidal functor 

$$\Delta^{op} \stackrel{Bar_T}{\to} [\mathbf{E}^T, \mathbf{E}^T]$$ 

that takes the generic monoid $[1]$ to $F U$ and generally $[n]$ to $(F U)^{\circ n}$. 

If furthermore $A$ is a $T$-algebra, there is an evaluation functor 

$$[\mathbf{E}^T, \mathbf{E}^T] \stackrel{eval_A}{\to} \mathbf{E}$$ 

and we have the following definition: 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
The **bar construction** $Bar_T(A)$ is the simplicial $T$-algebra given by the composite functor 

$$\Delta^{op} \stackrel{Bar_T}{\to} [\mathbf{E}^T, \mathbf{E}^T] \stackrel{eval_A}{\to} \mathbf{E}.$$ 

The composite 

$$\Delta^{op} \stackrel{Bar_T(A)}{\to} \mathbf{E}^T \stackrel{U}{\to} \mathbf{E}$$ 

will here be called the **bar resolution** of $A$. 
=-- 

In the notation of [[two-sided bar constructions]], the bar construction would be written as $Bar_T(A) = B(T, T, A)$. 

## Decalage and resolutions 

### Decalage 

To explain the sense in which $U Bar_T(A)$ is an *acyclic resolution* of (the constant simplicial object) $A$, we recall the fundamental [[decalage]] construction. Very simply, putting 

$$D = [1] + (-): \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op}$$ 

the decalage functor on simplicial objects $C^{\Delta^{op}}$ (valued in a category $C$) is the functor 

$$C^{\Delta^{op}} \stackrel{(1_C)^D}{\to} C^{\Delta^{op}}.$$ 

For reasons explained in a moment, we denote the decalage functor by $P$. Note that $D$ has a comonad structure (inherited from the comonoid structure on $[1]$ in $\Delta^{op}$), and therefore $P$ also carries a comonad structure. 

The notation $P$ is chosen because decalage is essentially a kind of path space construction, a simplicial analogue of a topological pullback 

$$\array{
P X & \to & X^I & \stackrel{ev_1} X \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{ev_0} & \\ 
{|X|} & \underset{id}{\to} & X
}$$ 

where $id: {|X|} \to X$ is the identity inclusion of the underlying set with the discrete topology. $P X$ is essentially a sum of spaces of based paths $(\alpha: (I, 0) \to (X, x_0)$ over all possible choices of basepoint $x_0$, fibered over $X$ by taking $\alpha$ to $\alpha(1)$. Each space of based paths is contractible and therefore $P X$ is acyclic. 

The following is a kind of nonce expression; this author (Todd Trimble) does not know how this is referred to in the literature: 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
An **acyclic structure** on a simplicial object $X: \Delta^{op} \to C$ is a $P$-coalgebra structure $X \to P X$. 
=-- 

Here a $P$-coalgebra structure on $X$ is the same as a *right* $D$-coalgebra (or $D$-comodule) structure, given by a simplicial map $h: X \to X \circ D$ satisfying evident equations. In more nuts-and-bolts terms, it consists of a series of maps $h_n: X([n]) \to X([n+1])$ satisfying suitable equations. 

The map $h: X \to X D$ is a homotopy. Again, turning to the topological analogue for intuition, the corresponding $h: X \to P X$ is a homotopy (or rather, the composite $X \to P X \to X^I$ can be turned into a homotopy $I \times X \to X$). The coalgebra structure $h: X \to P X$ has a retraction given by the counit $\varepsilon: P X \to X$ ... (to be continued).

###### Proposition

Regard $A$ as a constant simplicial object. The canonical morphism 

$$
  \mathrm{B}(T,A) \to A
$$

is a [[resolution]] of $A$.

In fact, the bar construction is the _universal_ resolution in the sense of

## Special cases

### For modules over an algebra

Let $A$ be a commutative [[associative algebra]]s over some [[ring]] $k$. Write $A Mod$ for the category of [[connective chain complex|connective]] [[chain complex]]es of [[module]]s over $A$.

For $N$ a right module, also $N \otimes_k A$ is canonically a module. This construction extends to a functor

$$
  A \otimes_k (-) : 
    A Mod 
      \to 
    A Mod 
  \,.
$$

The [[monoid]]-structure on $A$ makes this a [[monad]] in [[Cat]]: the monad product and unit are given by the product and unit in $A$.

For $N$ a module its right action $\rho :N \otimes A \to N$ makes the module an [[algebra over a monad|algebra over this monad]].

The bar construction $\mathrm{B}(A,N)$ is then the simplicial module

$$
  \cdots
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
  N \otimes_k A \otimes_k A \stackrel{\overset{Id \otimes \mu}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\rho \otimes Id}{\longrightarrow}} N \otimes_k A
  \,.
$$

Under the [[Moore complex]] functor of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] this is identified with a [[chain complex]] whose [[differential]] is given by the alternating sums of the face maps indicated above. 

This chain complex is what originally was called the **bar complex** in [[homological algebra]]. Because the first authors denoted its elements using a notation involving vertical bars ([Ginzburg](#Ginzburg))!!

This chain complex provides a resolution that computes the [[Tor]]

$$
  Tor(N, A \times A)
  \,.
$$

This gives the [[Hochschild homology]] of $A$. See there for more details.
