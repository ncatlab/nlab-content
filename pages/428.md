## Definition

The **bar construction** takes a [[monad]] $(T, \mu, \epsilon)$ equipped with an [[algbera for a monad|algebra-over-a-monad]] $(A, \rho)$ to the ([[augmented simplicial set|augmented]]) [[simplicial object]] whose structure maps are given by the structure maps of the monad and its action on its algebra:

$$
  \mathrm{B}(T,A)
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \cdots
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
    T T A
    \stackrel{\stackrel{\mu \cdot Id_A}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{T \cdot \rho}{\longrightarrow}}
    T A \stackrel{\rho}{\longrightarrow} A
  \right)
    \,.
$$

This simplicial object is typically a [[resolution]] of $A$.


## Properties

###### Proposition

Regard $A$ as a constant simplicial object. The canonical morphism 

$$
  \mathrm{B}(T,A) \to A
$$

is a [[resolution]] of $A$.

In fact, the bar construction is the _universal_ resolution in the sense of

## Special cases

### For modules over an algebra

Let $A$ be a commutative [[associative algebra]]s over some [[ring]] $k$. Write $A Mod$ for the category of [[connective chain complex|connective]] [[chain complex]]es of [[module]]s over $A$.

For $N$ a right module, also $N \otimes_k A$ is canonically a module. This construction extends to a functor

$$
  A \otimes_k (-) : 
    A Mod 
      \to 
    A Mod 
  \,.
$$

The [[monoid]]-structure on $A$ makes this a [[monad]] in [[Cat]]: the monad product and unit are given by the product and unit in $A$.

For $N$ a module its right action $\rho :N \otimes A \to N$ makes the module an [[algebra over a monad|algebra over this monad]].

The bar construction $\mathrm{B}(A,N)$ is then the simplicial module

$$
  \cdots
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
  N \otimes_k A \otimes_k A \stackrel{\overset{Id \otimes \mu}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\rho \otimes Id}{\longrightarrow}} N \otimes_k A
  \,.
$$

Under the [[Moore complex]] functor of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] this is identified with a [[chain complex]] whose [[differential]] is given by the alternating sums of the face maps indicated above. 

This chain complex is what originally was called the **bar complex** in [[homological algebra]]. Because the first authors denoted its elements using a notation involving vertical bars ([Ginzburg](#Ginzburg))!!

This chain complex provides a resolution that computes the [[Tor]]

$$
  Tor(N, A \times A)
  \,.
$$

This gives the [[Hochschild homology]] of $A$. See there for more details.
