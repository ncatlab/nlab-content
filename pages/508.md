_Categories Work_ is a book on [[category theory]] by Saunders Mac Lane.

The full title is _Categories for the Working Mathematician_. The original edition has the following chapters

*  I. Categories, functors, and natural transformations
*  II. Constructions on categories
*  III. Universals and limits
*  IV. Adjoints
*  V. Limits
*  VI. Monads and algebras
*  VII. Monoids
*  VIII. Abelian categories
*  IX. Special limits
*  X. Kan extensions

The 2nd edition was published in 1997 with two additional chapters:

* XI. Symmetry and braidings in monoidal categories

* XII. Structures in categories

_Categories Work_ is the standard reference for category theory, and we may often cite it here. Almost all of its terminology is widely adopted, although strangely (see [discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1897) at nForum) its approach to [[foundations]] is not.
