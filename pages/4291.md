## Definition

### In an abelian category

A [[short exact sequence]] $0\to A\to B\to C\to 0$ in an [[abelian category]] is said to be **split** if there exists an [[isomorphism]] of sequences with the sequence $0\to A\to A\oplus C\to C\to 0$, given by the [[direct sum]] and its canonical morphisms.

This is equivalent to the existence of a [[section]] of $B\to C$ or a [[retract]] $B\to A$.

Generally, a [[long exact sequence]] $C_\bullet$ is _split exact_ if the [[weak homotopy equivalence]] from the 0-chain complex, namely the [[quasi-isomorphism]] $0 \to C_\bullet$ is actually a [[chain homotopy]]-[[homotopy equivalence]], in that the [[identity]] on $C_\bullet$ has a [[null homotopy]]. 



### In a semi-abelian category

There is a nnabelian analog of split exact sequences in [[semiabelian categories]]. See there.
