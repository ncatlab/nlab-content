A $2$-category is any of several concepts that generalize [[category|categories]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. The original notion is that of a globular [[strict 2-category]], but the one most often used here is that of a [[bicategory]]. The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-category|categories]].

# Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$2$-category__ is an $\infty$-category such that every 3-morphism is an [[equivalence]], and all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 3$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $2$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $2$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than your preferred definition of $2$-category, but it will be equivalent; basically, you may have to rephrase equivalence of $2$-morphisms as [[equality]].
