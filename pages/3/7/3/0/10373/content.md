## Idea

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be  [[category]] [[category of modules|of]] [[modules]] or [[bimodules]] (say over a [[ring]], [[algebra]], or [[operator algebra]]). 

\begin{definition}
\label{EssentialSubmodule}
A [[subobject]] $M\subset N$ is an *essential submodule* of $N$ 
if $M$ has non-[[zero object|zero]] intersection ([[pullback]]) with any non-[[zero object|zero]] subobject of $N$, or equivalently: $M$ has zero intersection with only the [[zero object|zero subobject]] of $N$.

\end{definition} 

\begin{remark}
**(terminology)**
 Some authors call an essential submodule $M \subset N$ a *large submodule*, or, say that $N$ is an _essential extension_ of $M$; while other authors argue that this should be called *in-essential extension*. 

A [[monomorphism]] of modules $i \colon M\to N$ is called an *essential embedding* if $N$ is an essential extension of $i(M)$. This alternative terminology is useful for motivating the notion of *essential embeddability* in $N$ as a property of $M$.

In particular, one applies this terminology to [[ideals]], i.e. submodules (or subbimodules in the $2$-sided case) of a ring, algebra, or operator algebra itself. Hence one speaks of _essential ideals_, etc. For essential extensions, one considers [[extensions]] of algebras, where 'essential' still refers to non-intersection with submodules rather than with subalgebras.

For [[C-star algebras|$C^\ast$-algebras]], essential ideals are required to be [[closed subset|closed]] and 2-sided. 
\end{remark}

In [AHRT02](#AHRT02) the following generalized notion is considered

\begin{definition}
A [[morphism]] $h$ among a [[class]] $H$ of morphisms in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is *$H$-essential* if for every morphism $g$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the composite
$g\circ h$ lies in $H$ only if $g$ does. 
\end{definition}
For $H$ is the class of [[monomorphisms]] in a [[category of modules]] this reduces again to the above notion of essential extension.



## Properties

\begin{proposition}
If $R$ is a ring, a (left, say) $R$-module $M\neq 0$ is [[uniform module|uniform]] if every nonzero submodule of $M$ is essential. In other words, the intersection of any two nonzero submodules of $M$ is nonzero. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Every essential embedding $I\hookrightarrow M$ where $I$ is [[injective morphism|injective]] is an [[isomorphism]]. 
\end{proposition}
See also *[[injective hull]]* for related statements. 

\begin{proposition}
A monomorphism $h colon M\to N$ is essential iff $g\circ h$ is monic only if $g$ is monic. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Indeed, if $h$ is essential and $g$ is not monic, then $Ker g\cap M\neq 0$ hence $Ker (g|_M)\neq 0$ and $g\circ h$ is not monic. Conversely, suppose $g\circ h$ is monic implies $g$ is monic. If $h$ were not essential then there would be $0\neq K\subset N$ such that $K\cap M = 0$; thus the cokernel map $g: N\to N/K$ is not monic while $g\circ h$ is monic because  $Ker(g)\cap Im(h) = K\cap M = 0$ and $h$ is monic. Since this is a contradiction, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The [[socle]] of a module ([[internal sum]] of all [[simple module|simple]] submodules equals the intersection of all essential submodules. 
\end{proposition}
