A __bireflective subcategory__ $B\subset C$ is a subcategory which is both [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] and [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]]; i.e. it is a fully faithful functor possesing both left and right adjoints. 

Some people use the term in different, weaker meaning, that the unit of the adjunction is a [[bimorphism]].
