##Idea 

A **graded modality** is an indexed family of [[modalities]] with some additional [[structure]] on the indices which mirrors the structure of the axioms/proof rules.

For example, the [[exponential modality]] of [[linear logic]] $!$ has a graded counterpart in [[bounded linear logic]], where $!$ is replaced with a family of modalities $!_n$ indexed by the natural numbers (the reuse bound).
