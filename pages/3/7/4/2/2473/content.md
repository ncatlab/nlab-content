## Definition 

Let $R$ be a [[discrete integral domain]]. We say that an element $r\in R$ is a _unit_ if it is [[invertible element|invertible]]. A non-unit is called _irreducible_ if it can not be represented as a product of two non-units. Note that then, $0$ is never irreducible, because it is a product of two non-units under the form $0 = 0.0$. It is often included in the definition of an irreducible element that it must be non-zero but this is in fact redudant. 

An integral domain $R$ is a __unique factorization domain__ (UFD for short) if every non-zero non-unit has a factorization $u = r_1 \cdots r_n$ (where $n \ge 1$) as product of irreducibles and this decomposition is unique up to renumbering and rescaling the irreducibles by units. 

Put differently: $R$ is a UFD precisely when the multiplicative monoid of nonzero [[principal ideals]] of $R$ (which is isomorphic to the quotient monoid $Can(R)/R^\times$, where $Can(R) \coloneqq R \backslash \{0\}$ denotes the [[multiplicative subset of cancellative elements]] in $R$ and $R^\times$ denotes the [[group of units]] in $R$) is a [[commutative monoid]] [[free object|freely generated]] by irreducible principal ideals. It follows that if $K$ is the [[field of fractions]] of $R$, then the [[quotient group]] $K^\times/R^\times$ is an abelian group that is freely generated by the set of cosets $f R^\times$ with $f$ ranging over irreducible elements. As a side remark, we observe that in this circumstance the exact sequence 

$$0 \to R^\times \to K^\times \to K^\times/R^\times \to 0$$ 

splits and there is an isomorphism $K^\times \cong R^\times \oplus (K^\times/R^\times)$ of abelian groups. 

## Examples 

* The ring of (rational) [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD. 

* A [[principal ideal domain]] (PID) is a UFD. (In particular, a [[Euclidean domain]] is a UFD.) As a partial converse, a [[Dedekind domain]] that is a UFD is a PID.  

* If $R$ is a UFD, then its [[polynomial]] ring $R[x]$ is also a UFD. 

* If $R$ is a UFD, then so is any [[localization]] $S^{-1} R$. 

* A [[regular local ring]] (for example, a [[discrete valuation]] ring) is a UFD. 

* If $R$ is a UFD and all of its localizations at primes are regular local rings, then the ring of [[formal power series]] $R[ [x] ]$ is a UFD. 

* For $D$ a positive integer, the [[algebraic integer|ring of integers]] in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ is a UFD iff $D$ is a *Heegner number*, namely one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163$. 

* If $R$ is not [[integral closure|integrally closed]], then it is not a UFD. 

## Properties 

* As noted above, a UFD is necessarily integrally closed. 

* The lattice of principal ideals under the inclusion order is a distributive lattice. 

* There is a useful characterization of UFDs by [[Irving Kaplansky]]:

\begin{proposition}
Let $R$ be an [[integral domain]]. Then, $R$ is a UFD iff every non-zero [[prime ideal]] contains a non-zero non-unit [[prime element]].
\end{proposition}
