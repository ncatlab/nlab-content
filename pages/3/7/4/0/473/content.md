#History#

The original _tangle hypothesis_ was formulated in

* J. Baez and J. Dolan, _Higher-dimensional Algebra and Topological Quantum Field Theory_ 1995 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503002)) 

in the context of [[FQFT|extended topological]] [[quantum field theory]] as:

* **Tangle Hypothesis.** _The $n$-category of framed $n$-tangles in $n+k$ dimensions is $(n+k)$-equivalent
to the free weak $k$-tuply monoidal n-category with duals on one object._

In the light of [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]] (where this is motivated from), which is really the representation theory of these tangle categories, this can be rephrased as 

* **Extended TQFT Hypothesis.** An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is a weak $n$-functor, preserving all levels of duality, from the $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms to $n Hilb$, the $n$-category of $n$-Hilbert spaces.

* **Cobordism Hypothesis.** The $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms is the free stable $n$-category with duals on one object.

* **The primacy of the point.** An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is completely described by the $n$-Hilbert space it assigns to a point.

(In this formulation this is taken from 

* Bruce Bartlett, _On unitary 2-representations of finite groups and topological quantumfield theory_. PhD thesis, Sheffield (2008)
)

More recently Mike Hopkins and Jacob Lurie have claimed 
(see [Hopkins-Lurie on Baez-Dolan](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html))
to have formalized and proven this hypothesis (at least for $n \leq 2$) in the context of [[(n,r)-category|(infinity,n)-categories]] modeled on [[n-category|n-categories]] [[internalization|internal to ]] [[quasi-category|quasicategories]]. See 

* Jacob Lurie, _On the classification of topological field theories_ ([pdf](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/cobordism.pdf))

#Statement of the generalized tangle hypothesis#

The $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category of $G$-structured $n$-tangles in the $(n + k)$-cube is the [[fundamental category|fundamental]] $(n + k)$-category with duals of $(M G,Z)$.

* $M G$ is the Thom space of group $G$.
* $G$ can be any group equipped with a homomorphism to $O(k)$. ([comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006471))
