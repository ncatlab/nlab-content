## Statement

The _tangle hypothesis_ ([Baez and Dolan 95](#BaezDolan95)) is as follows:

###### Tangle Hypothesis

The $n$-category of framed $n$-[[tangles]] in $n+k$ dimensions is $(n+k)$-equivalent to the free [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] with duals on one object.

The tangle hypothesis may be seen as a refinement of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] in the sense that the latter arises from the former in the limit $k \to \infty$:

###### [[cobordism hypothesis|Cobordism Hypothesis]]

The $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms is the free stable $n$-category with duals on one object (the point).

## Generalized tangle hypothesis

The tangle hypothesis has been generalized to allow certain structures on the tangles.

The $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category of $G$-structured $n$-tangles in the $(n + k)$-cube is the [[fundamental category|fundamental]] $(n + k)$-category with duals of $(M G,Z)$.

* $M G$ is the [[Thom space]] of group $G$.
* $G$ can be any group equipped with a homomorphism to $O(k)$. ([comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006471))

## The tangle hypothesis as a consequence of the cobordism hypothesis

While the tangle hypothesis and its generalizations may be seen as refinements of the cobordism hypothesis and its generalizations, Lurie shows ([Lurie 09, Sec. 4.4](#LurieCTFT)) that the former may be deduced from the latter when expressed in a sufficiently general form.
