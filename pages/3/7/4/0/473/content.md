#History#

The original _tangle hypothesis_ was formulated in

* J. Baez and J. Dolan, _Higher-dimensional Algebra and Topological Quantum Field Theory_ 1995 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503002)) 

in the context of [[FQFT|extended topological]] [[quantum field theory]] as:

**Tangle Hypothesis.** _The $n$-category of framed $n$-tangles in $n+k$ dimensions is $(n+k)$-equivalent
to the free weak $k$-tuply monoidal n-category with duals on one object._

More recently Mike Hopkins and Jacob Lurie have claimed to have formalized and proven this hypothesis in the context of [[(n,r)-category|(infinity,n)-categories]] modeled on [[n-category|n-categories]] [[internalization|internal to ]] [[quasi-category|quasicategories]]. See 

* [Hopkins-Lurie on Baez-Dolan](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html).

#Statement of the generalized tangle hypothesis#

The $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category of $G$-structured $n$-tangles in the $(n + k)$-cube is the [[fundamental category|fundamental]] $(n + k)$-category of $(M G,Z)$.

* $M G$ is the Thom space of group $G$.
* $G$ can be any group equipped with a homomorphism to $O(k)$. ([comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006471))
