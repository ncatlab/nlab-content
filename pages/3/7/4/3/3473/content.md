In Algebraic Topology, profinite homotopy types are frequently encountered. This is often because of the use of [[profinite completion of homotopy type|profinite completion]]s of homotopy types in an attempt to get more 'accessible' information out of a homotopy type. The theory has applications both in Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic topology. 

One origin of the theory can be found in [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], in which he defined an [[algebraic fundamental group]] of a scheme using its _finite_ 'covering spaces'.  These correspond to the finite field extensions in the [[Grothendieck's Galois theory|The classical case of fields]], and from that perspective one can ask what the higher profinite homotopy n-types of a scheme should classify.    

 In the 1960s Artin and Mazur constructed a functor which associates to
each locally noetherian scheme $X$ its &#233;tale homotopy type $X_{et}$ , an object of
$pro\Ho(SSets)$, the [[pro-object|pro-category]] of the homotopy category $Ho(SSets)$ of simplicial sets. They observed that this did not correspond to a homotopy category of a [[model category]] on a category of pro simplicial sets.

* Dennis Sullivan introduced profinite completions into topology in his work:
D. Sullivan, _Genetics of homotopy theory and the Adams conjecture_, 
Annals of Math., 100, (1974), 1&#8211;79. The Adams conjecture, which is a statement about purely topological phenomena, was then proved by Quillen using these ideas.


* At about the same time, Bousfield and Kan, studied profinite completions amongst a wealth of other stuff in
A. Bousfield and D. Kan, 1972, _Homotopy limits, Completions and localizations_, volume 304 of Lecture Notes in Maths , Springer-Verlag. 



* In the 1990s, Morel and Voevodsky, defined a neat framework
for the use of topological methods in algebraic geometry. They embedded the
category of smooth schemes of 'finite type over a field k into a larger category
of 'k-spaces', which carries the structure of a closed model category. The study of these k-spaces is linked to &#233;tale homotopy theory, see Schmidt, _On the &#233;tale homotopy type of
Morel-Voevodsky spaces_, and Isaksen, _Etale realization on the $A^1$-homotopy theory of schemes_. Adv. in Math. 184, 37--63 (2004).
