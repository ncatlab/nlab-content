## Idea

The _Adams-Novikov spectral sequence_ is a class of [[spectral sequences]] which converge to and hence are used to compute [[homotopy groups]] of [[connective spectra]],  hence in particular the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]. It refines the _[[Adams spectral sequence]]_ by replacing [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ by[[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. 

More generally for $E$ any suitable [[E-infinity ring]] there is an Adams-Novikov-type spectral sequence involving $E$-[[generalized cohomology]]/[[generalized homology]]. This fully general notion is often again just referred to as the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_. Accordingly, see there for more.

## Properties

### Relation to Brown-Peterson spectrum

The $p$-component of the $E^2$-term of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for the [[sphere spectrum]], hence the one converging to the 
[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_\ast(\mathbb{S})$ is

$$
  Ext_{BP_\ast(BP)}(BP_\ast, BP_\ast)
  \,,
$$

where $BP$ denotes the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]] at prime $p$.

recalled e.g. as [Ravenel, theorem 1.4.2](#Ravenel)
