## Idea

The theory called _the theory of general relativity_ is a [[classical field theory]] that in [[physics]] describes the field of [[gravity]].

In general relativity, physical [[spacetime]] is modeled in terms of [[differential geometry]] as a [[Lorentzian manifold]] whose [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] -- or rather the [[Levi-Civita connection]] that corresponds to it -- encodes the field of [[gravity]].

The [[action functional]] describing the dynamics of this field is the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]], in which the field of gravity enters in terms of the integral of the [[scalar curvature]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] over spacetime.

As is usual in [[classical field theory]], the physically realized configurations -- here: Levi-Civita connections -- are those that extremize this functional. The [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s characterizing these extrema are the [[Einstein equations]].

Historically the theory of general relativity was developed by [[Albert Einstein]] based on the theory known as [[special relativity]]. Given the conceptual simplicity of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]], there are several variations of his original version of the theory that are immediately obtained by adding certain terms to the action functional. One of these generalization is [[supergravity]], which extends the theory from ordinary [[differential geometry]] to [[supergeometry]].
