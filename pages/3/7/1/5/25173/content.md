## Definition

An *ordered local integral domain* is a [[local ring]] which is both an [[ordered local ring]] and a [[local integral domain]]: a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with a [[strict weak order]] $\lt$ such that the positive elements form a [[multiplicative subset]] of $R$, the sum of two positive elements is positive, every element $a \in R$ is invertible if and only if it is positive or negative, and if the product of two elements is equal to zero, than one of the two elements is equal to zero. 

## Properties

Unlike the [[theory]] of [[ordered fields]], the theory of ordered local integral domains is a [[coherent theory]].
