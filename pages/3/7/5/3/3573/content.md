A version of Koszul type resolutions appear in attempts to do quantizations; namely a general theory leads to singularities and new ghost and antighost fields are used to remove them. The simplest such cohomological method is BRST quantization. Much more general versions, allowing more general singularities is BV-quantization introduced by physicists Batalin and Vilkovisky in late 1980s.
