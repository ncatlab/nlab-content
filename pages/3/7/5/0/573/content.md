## Idea ##

Combining the idea of $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] with that of $n$-[[n-category|category]], an $(\infty,n)$-category is supposed to be an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] which behaves like its $k$-morphisms for $k \gt n$ are all [[equivalences]]. See [[(n,r)-category]].

## Idea in terms of complete Segal spaces ##

One definition building on that of [[(∞,1)-category]] in terms of [[complete Segal spaces]] was given in 2005 by Clark Barwick and recently put to use and popularized by Jacob Lurie in [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]] and in more detail in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _$(\infty,2)$-Categories and the Goodwillie Calculus I_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0462))

Due to this definition an $(\infty,n)$-category is an [[n-fold complete Segal space]].

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,n)Cat$ of all $(\infty,n)$-categories. This is such that $(\infty,1)Cat$ is indeed equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

See def. 1.3.6 in the above reference.


Another definition also building on that of [[(∞,1)-category]] in terms of [[complete Segal spaces]] was given in early 2009 by Charles Rezk in

* [[Charles Rezk]], _A cartesian presentation of weak n-categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3602))

In the above paper, they are called $(\infty,n)$-$\Theta$-spaces.

This definition makes use the shape categories $\Theta_n$ originally introduced by Andr&#233; Joyal; $(\infty,n)$-categories are defined to be the fibrant objects in an appropriate [[Bousfield localization]] of the [[injective model structure]] on [[simplicial presheaves]] on $\Theta_n$.  


## Special cases ##

See also 
* [[∞-groupoid]] = $(\infty,0)$-category
* [[(∞,1)-category]]
* [[(∞,2)-category]]
* etc ...
* [[∞-category]] = $(\infty,\infty)$-category.

In addition,
* [[(n,r)-category|(m,n)-categories]] can be obtained as particular $(\infty,n)$-categories whose $k$-cells are trivial for $k\gt m$.
* In particular, [[n-categories]] = $(n,n)$-categories can be so obtained. 


## Definitions

A list of known definitions of $n$-category, which should include all definitions of $(\infty,n)$-category as well, can be found at the page [[n-category]].  Note that some of these definitions (in particular, the "inductive" ones) only work for $n\lt \infty$.


## Examples ##

One motivating example for $(\infty,n)$-categories is the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] which plays a central role in the formalization of the [[cobordism hypothesis]].
