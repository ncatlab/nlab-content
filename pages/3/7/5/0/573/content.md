#Idea#

Combining the idea of $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] with that of $n$-[[n-category|category]], an $(\infty,n)$-category is supposed to be an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] which behaves like its $k$-morphisms for $k \gt n$ are all [[equivalences]]. See [[(n,r)-category]].

#Idea in terms of complete Segal spaces#

One definition buidling on that of [[(∞,1)-category]] in terms of [[complete Segal spaces]] was given in 2005 by Clark Barwick and recently put to use and popularized by Jacob Lurie in [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]] and in more detail in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _$(\infty,2)$-Categories and the Goodwillie Calculus I_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0462))

Due to this definition an $(\infty,n)$-category is an [[n-fold complete Segal space]].

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,n)Cat$ of all $(\infty,n)$-categories. This is such that $(\infty,1)Cat$ is indeed equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

See def. 1.3.6 in the above reference.


#Special cases#

See also 
* [[∞-groupoid]] = $(\infty,0)$-category
* [[(∞,1)-category]]
* [[(∞,2)-category]]
* etc ...
* [[∞-category]] = $(\infty,\infty)$-category


#Examples#

The motivating example for $(\infty,n)$-categories is the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] which plays a central role in the formalization of the [[cobordism hypothesis]].
