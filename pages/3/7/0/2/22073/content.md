## Idea

One way of visualizing and/or presenting higher dimensional [[bordisms]]/[[tangles]]/[[knots]] is as a sequence of [[pre-images]] of a sequence of values of a suitable [[Morse function]]. If one thinks of the Morse function here as assigning a "[[time]]"-cordinate to the [[bordism]]/[[tangle]]/[[knot]] then each of these pre-images is like a frame of a movie ([Carter-Saito 93](#CarterSaito93)).
