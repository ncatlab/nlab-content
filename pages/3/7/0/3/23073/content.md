# Full (unrestricted) comprehension

## Idea

In [[mathematical logic]]/[[mathematical foundations]], the [[axiom]] or rule of **full** or **unrestricted comprehension** says that for any property $P$, there exists a [[set]] of all objects satisfying $P$:

$$ \{ x \mid P(x) \}. $$

[[set theory|Set theory]] with the unrestricted [[comprehension]] rule is called [[naive set theory]], and is inconsistent due to [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Curry's paradox]].  Here we mention several approaches to this issue.

## Restricted comprehension

Standard [[set theories]] such as [[ZFC]] avoid this [[paradox]] by replacing unrestricted comprehension with the [[axiom scheme of separation]] (or "restricted comprehension"), which restricts $x$ to lie in some previously specified set $X$.

## Stratified comprehension

Set theories such as [[New Foundations]] instead replace comprehension by a rule of "stratified comprehension".  This permits a "[[set of all sets]]" but still appears to avoid paradox.

## Substructural logics

It is also possible to retain full comprehension but avoid paradox by modifying the ambient logic.  Passing to [[constructive logic]] doesn't help, and indeed the root issue has nothing to do with [[negation]] as such, since [[Curry's paradox]] can be stated without any [[negation]].  One might think that [[paraconsistent logic]] would help, but many paraconsistent logics are still vulnerable to Curry's paradox.  Perhaps the most obvious culprit is the [[contraction rule]], and indeed [[linear logic]] (including some paraconsistent logics) can admit a full comprehension rule without explosion.

## Normal logics

Another possibility is to keep the contraction rule but restrict the use of the [[cut rule]].  It is not necessary to forbid all uses of cut, since many cuts can be normalized or eliminated.  Indeed, in ordinary consistent logic, *all* cuts can be eliminated; but in the presence of full comprehension they cannot all be.  Thus, another way to avoid paradox with full comprehension is to permit only proofs that can be [[normal form|normalized]].

Note that unlike a restriction on contraction, this is a "global" restriction: the proofs of two lemmas can independently be valid, but their combination may no longer be so.  Similar "global" restrictions on logic were investigated by [Fitch 1953](#Fitch52), [69](#Fitch69).

### Global restrictions

Several global restrictions were considered in

* {#Fitch52} [[Frederic Fitch]], *Symbolic Logic: An introduction*, Ronald Press, New York 1952

* {#Fitch69} [[Frederic Fitch]], *A method for avoiding the Curry paradox*, in *Essays in Honor of Carl G. Hempel*, Reidel, Dordrecht, Holland 1969, pp. 255--265 ([doi:10.1007/978-94-017-1466-2](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-1466-2))

The notation therein is somewhat difficult to follow for a modern reader, especially due to the somewhat confused treatment of what nowadays would be called free and bound variables.  A more modern explanation of Fitch's restrictions can be found in:

* Susan Rogerson, _Natural deduction and Curry's paradox_, Journal of Philosophical Logic (2007) 36: 155--179. [pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10992-006-9032-0.pdf)

The normalizability restriction is also discussed philosophically in
