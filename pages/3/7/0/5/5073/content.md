## Idea

An (open) **annulus** is a [[topological space]] that is [[homeomorphic]] to the closed unit [[disk]] $D^2_1$ with an disk-shaped [[open neighbourhood]] of the origin removed.

An often used  model for the corresponding closed annulus is the subspace $\big\{(x,y)\mid 1\leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 4\big\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, of the plane consisting of the point lying between a unit circle and a circle of radius 2, both centered on the origin.
