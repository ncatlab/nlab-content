__Linear algebra__ over a [[field]] $K$ is the study of the [[category]] $K$-[[Vect]].  Sometimes one uses the term '$K$-linear algebra' to mean an [[algebra]] over $K$.  (Compare '$K$-[[linear map]]'.)

Classical linear algebra is done over a [[real-closed field]] or an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic]] $0$; the latter is the simplest context, which is now pretty thoroughly understood.  Traditionally, we take these fields to be the field of [[real numbers]] and the field of [[complex numbers]], although arguably we only really use [[algebraic number|algebraic numbers]].  (From a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] point of view, some of the classical material is valid only over [[discrete fields]], so we *must* restrict attention to algebraic numbers, or to some discrete extension, for these results to hold in their classical form.)

Fancier linear algebra is done over incomplete fields and fields with positive characteristic (and constructively over nondiscrete fields).
