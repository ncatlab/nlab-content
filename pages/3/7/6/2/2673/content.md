The [[action functional]] of [[gravity]] was originally conceived as a functional on the space of [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]]s of a [[manifold]] $X$. Later on it was realized that it may alternatively naturally be thought of as a functional on the space of [[connection on a bundle|connections]] with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]]. This is known as the **first order formalism** or the **Palatini formalism**.

The first order formalism is also the formalism in which [[supergravity]] has to be formulated.
