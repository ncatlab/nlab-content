## Definition

A _3-group_ is equivalently 

1. a [[2-truncated]] [[∞-group]];

1. a [[2-groupoid]] $G$ equipped with the structure of a [[loop space object]] of a connected [[3-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G$ (its [[delooping]]);

1. a [[monoidal 2-category]] in which every [[object]] has an weak inverse under the tensor product.

## Properties

### Presentation by crossed complexes

Some classes of 3-groups are modeled by  [[2-crossed modules]] or  [[crossed squares]].
