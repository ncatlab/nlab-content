I'm a visiting research fellow at the University of Adelaide (in Australia) and I work at the [National Centre for Vocational Education Research](http://www.ncver.edu.au/). I work on 2-bundles and internal groupoids/categories, with general interest in homotopy theory apr&egrave;s Grothendieck.

See my [private $n$Lab area](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage) for various things, including a project on Lie fundamental bigroupoids being undertaken jointly with [[Andrew Stacey]] and various scribbles.

## Selected writings ##

* _Internal categories and anafunctors_ (PhD thesis, chapter I - slightly old version) 
([pdf](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/internal_cats_and_anafunctors.pdf))

This chapter is of independent interest, and is much smaller than the full thesis:

* _[[Fundamental Bigroupoids and 2-Covering Spaces]]_ (full PhD thesis) ([pdf](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/DMRthesis_final.pdf))

For a lite introduction to the ideas in my thesis, see

* _2-covering spaces_ - talk at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Australian Mathematical Society, at the University of South Australia, 30 September 2009 ([slides](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/DMRAustMS09.pdf))

Only slightly related to my thesis (and in a hidden way that never got written up) is this article:

* _The inner automorphism 3-group of a strict 2-group_, joint with [[nLab:Urs Schreiber|Urs Schreiber]], Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures, vol. 3(1), 2008, pp.193&#8211;245 (available at the arXiv:[07081741](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0708.1741))
