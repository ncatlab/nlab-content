I'm a PhD student at the University of Adelaide in South Australia and I work at the [National Centre for Vocational Education Research](http://www.ncver.edu.au/). I work on 2-bundles and internal groupoids, with general interest in homotopy theory apr&#232;s Grothendieck.

See my [private $n$Lab area](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage). The current (8 December 2009) draft of my thesis is on the linked page, as well as links to my papers on the arXiv.
