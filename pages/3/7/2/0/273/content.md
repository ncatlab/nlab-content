It was originally apparently John Roberts who understood (remarkably: while thinking about quantum field theory in the guise of [[AQFT]]) that general cohomology is about coloring simplices in $\infty$-categories.

This is recounted for instance by Ross Street in

* Ross Street, _Categorical and combinatorial aspects of descent theory_ ([pdf](http://arxiv.org/ftp/math/papers/0303/0303175.pdf))

and 

* Ross Street, _An australian conspectus on higher categories_ ([pdf](http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/Minneapolis.pdf)).

There is a chain of inclusions

along which one can generalize the coefficient objects of ordinary cohomology. (See [[omega-groupoid]], [[omega-category]]). Since doing so in particular generalizes abelian groups to nonabelian groups (but goes much further!) this is generally addressed as leading to _nonabelian cohomology_.

Depending on how one thinks of the object whose cohomology one computes, there are two different ways to realize this:

* [[nonabelian sheaf cohomology]] in terms of [[descent and codescent|descent]] for $\omega$-category valued presheaves, i.e. in terms of [[infinity-stack]]s;

* in terms of [[homotopical cohomology theory]] which realizes [[nonabelian cocycle|cocycles]] as $\omega$-[[anafunctor]]s.

Either way, one obtaines a notion of _cohomology on $\infty$-categories with coefficients in $\infty$-catgories_. This is, most generally, the setup of "[[nonabelian cohomology]]".

But sometimes the term is used in a more restrictive sense. Often people mean "nonabelian _group_ cohomology" when they say nonabelian cohomology, hence restricting to the domains to [[group]]s, which are [[groupoid]]s with a single object.

This kind of nonabelian cohomology is discussed for instance in

* John C. Baez, Michael Shulman, _Lectures on $n$-Categories and Cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)).

That and how ordinary group cohomology is reproduced from the [[homotopical cohomology theory]] of [[omega-groupoid]]s is discussed in detail in 

* R. Brown, P. Higgins, R. Sivera, [[Nonabelian algebraic topology]].
