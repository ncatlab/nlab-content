The notion of [[cohomology]] finds its natural general formulation in terms of [[hom-spaces]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]], as described at *[[cohomology]]*. Many of the cohomologies which have been traditionally considered, such as [[abelian sheaf cohomology|sheaf cohomology]], turn out to be just a special case of the general situation, for objects which are sufficiently abelian in the sense of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (∞,1)-categories]].

Therefore to amplify that one is looking at general [[cohomology]] without restricting to [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian cohomology]] one speaks of  **nonabelian cohomology**. 

\linebreak

To say this in a bit more detail:


### Cohomology via classifying spaces

It is a classical and yet possibly undervalued fact that *reasonable [[cohomology]] theories have [[classifying spaces]]* (and more generally *[[moduli stacks|classifying stacks]]*). To quickly recall (more details and pointers in [FSS23, §2](#FSS23)):

**Ordinary cohomology.**
This begins with the observation that ([[reduced cohomology|reduced]]) [[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]] [[singular cohomology]], with [[coefficients]] in a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[abelian group]] $A$, is classified in degree $n$ by [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]] $K(A,n)$ -- in that on well-behaved topological spaces $X$, notably on [[smooth manifolds]], there are [[natural isomorphisms]] between the ordinary [[cohomology groups]] and the [[connected components]] of the respective ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[mapping spaces]]:
\[
  \label{OrdinaryCohomologyRepresented}
  H^n(X;\, A)
  \;\simeq\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}
  \big(
    X,\,
    K(A,n)
  \big)
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \widetilde H^n(X;\, A)
  \;\simeq\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}
  \big(
    X,\,
    K(A,n)
  \big)
  \,.
\]
This equivalence makes manifest the [characteristic properties](Whiethead-generalized+cohomology#AxiomsReduced) of cohomology: homotopy invariance, exactness and wedge property, since these are now immediately implied by general abstract properties of mapping spaces.

Moreover, these EM-spaces are in fact [[loop spaces]] of each other, via weak homotopy equivalences
\[
  \label{LoopingEquivOnEmSpaces}
  \sigma_n
  \;\colon\;
    K(A,n)
    \xrightarrow{\;\sim\;}
    \Omega K(A,n+1)
\]
that thereby represent the *[[suspension isomorphisms]]* between ordinary cohomology groups, as follows: 

$$
  \widetilde H^{n}(X;A)
    \;\simeq\;
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}\big(
    X
    ,\,
    K(A,n)
  \big)
  \xrightarrow{
    (\sigma_n)_\ast
  }
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}\big(
      X
      ,\,
      \Omega
      K(A,n+1)
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}\big(
      \Sigma
      X
      ,\,
      K(A,n+1)
    \big)
    \;\simeq\;
    \widetilde H^{n+1}\big(
      \Sigma X
      ;\,
      A
    \big)
    \,.
$$


\linebreak

**Ordinary non-abelian cohomology.**
Note here that it is the loop space property \eqref{LoopingEquivOnEmSpaces}, and hence the corresponding [[suspension isomorphism]], which reflect the fact that the coefficient $A$ has been assumed to be an *abelian* group:
For a non-abelian group $G$, an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(G, 1) \,\simeq\, B G$ still exists (cf. *[[classifying space]]*), but is *not a loop space*.

While the suspension isomorphism is thus lost for non-abelian coefficients, the assignment
\[
  \label{OrdinaryNonAbelianCohomology}
  X
  \;\;
   \mapsto
  \;\;
  H^1\big(
    X
    ;\, 
    G
  \big)
  \;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}\big(
    X
    ,\,
    B G
  \big)
  \;\;\;
  \in\;
  \mathrm{Set}^{\ast/}
\]
still satisfies homotopy invariance, exactness and wedge property, just by the general properties of mapping spaces, and hence has all the characteristic properties of ordinary cohomology -- except for its abelian-ness.
Accordingly, (eq:OrdinaryNonAbelianCohomology) is known as *non-abelian cohomology*, famous from early applications in [[Chern-Weil theory]].

\linebreak

**Whitehead-generalized cohomology.** But if or as long as we do insist on abelian cohomology groups related by suspension isomorphisms, we may still immediately generalize ordinary cohomology in the form (eq:OrdinaryCohomologyRepresented), simply by using any other sequence of classifying spaces $(E_n)_{n=0}^\infty$, being successive loop spaces of each other as in (eq:LoopingEquivOnEmSpaces),
$$
  \sigma_n \,:\,
    E_n
    \xrightarrow{\; \sim \;}
    \Omega
    E_{n+1}
    \,,
$$
as such called a *[[sequential spectrum|sequential]] [[Omega-spectrum|$\Omega$-spectrum]] of spaces*, or just a *spectrum*, for short. The [[Brown representability theorem]] says that the resulting assignments
$$
  X
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  E^n(X)
  \,\coloneqq\,
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}\big(
    X
    ;\,
    E_n
  \big)
$$
are equivalently the *[[Whitehead-generalized cohomology|generalized cohomology theories]]* as introduced by Whitehead, including examples such as [[K-theory]], [[elliptic cohomology]] and [[cobordism cohomology]].

\linebreak

**Non-abelian generalized cohomology.** But as we just saw, suspension isomorphisms are to be regarded as *extra* structure on cohomology. Not necessarily requiring them leads to consider *any pointed space* $\mathscr{A}$ as the classifying space of a non-abelian generalized cohomology theory, defined in evident generalization of (eq:OrdinaryNonAbelianCohomology) simply by
\[
  \label{NonabelianCohomology}
  H^1\big(
    X
    ;\,
    \Omega\mathscr{A}
  \big)
  \;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}\big(
    X
    ,\,
    \mathscr{A}
  \big)
  \,.
\]
Here the notation on the left is suggestive of the fact that any loop space $\Omega \mathscr{A}$ canonically carries the structure of a higher homotopy-coherent group -- a groupal $A_\infty$-space or [[infinity-group|$\infty$-group]], for short --  whose de-looping [is equivalent](May+recognition+theorem#statement) to the connected component $\mathscr{A}_0$ of the original space:
\[
  \label{DeloopingEquivalence}
  \mathscr{A}_0
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  B \, \Omega \mathscr{A}
  \,.
\]

For instance, in the archetypical case where
$\mathscr{A} \,\equiv\, S^n$ is the [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]], then the non-abelian generalized cohomology theory that it classifies is known as (unstable) [[Cohomotopy]] $\pi^n$
\[
  \label{Cohomotopy}
  \widetilde H^1\big(
    X
    ;\, 
    \Omega S^n
  \big)
  \;\;
  \equiv
  \;\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}\big(
    X
    ,\,
    S^n
  \big)
  \;\;
  \equiv
  \;\;
  \pi^n(X)
  \,,
\]
in dual reference to the familar *homotopy* groups
$$
  \pi_n(X)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  \pi_0
  \,
  \mathrm{Maps}^{\ast/\!}\big(
    S^n
    ,\,
    X
  \big)
  \,.
$$

Another example of non-abelian generalized cohomology is [[unstable topological K-theory]], whose classifying spaces are taken to be finite stages $\mathrm{U}(n)$ of the sequential colimits which construct the classifying spaces of topological K-theory.

### Developing non-abelian cohomology

Fundamental, elementary and compelling as the notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology in (eq:NonabelianCohomology) is, it has long remained underappreciated. For example, none of the original authors on [[Cohomotopy]] (eq:Cohomotopy) address their subject as a cohomology theory, instead the early development revolves around partial fixes for the perceived defect of co-homotopy sets to not in general carry group structure.
The situation does not improve with the early development of "[[non-abelian gerbes]]", whose original description appears unwieldy. 

Explicit acknowledgement of (stacky) non-abelian generalized cohomology  in the transparent guise (eq:NonabelianCohomology)
appears only in a lecture of 2002 [Toen 2002](#Toen02), (possibly following [Simpson 2002](#Simpson02) where non-abelian generalization of [[de Rham cohomology]] is considered). 

Two independent developments around 2009 put non-abelian generalized cohomology into practical context: 

* The discovery of [[nonabelian Poincaré duality]] ([Lurie 09 §3.8](nonabelian+Poincaré+duality#Lurie09)), relating non-abelian cohomology (later made explicit in [Lurie 2014 Def. 6](#Lurie14)) of manifolds  to "non-abelian homology" in the guise of "[[topological chiral homology]]" (which, in contrast to non-abelian cohomology, takes work to define); 

* The observation in theoretical physics ([SS 2008](#SS08), [Sc 2009](#Schreiber09)) that [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|charge/flux-quantization laws]] for [[higher gauge fields]] are generally in non-abelian cohomology.

\linebreak

With non-abelian generalized cohomology thus recognized as a worthwhile subject, one is led to generalize familiar constructions in abelian cohomology, as far as possible, and to explore the consequences.

First, one may straightforwardly equip non-abelian cohomology with further attributes: Considering the right hand side of (eq:NonabelianCohomology) not just for plain spaces but for sheaves of spaces ([[infinity-stack|higher stacks]]) leads to non-abelian generalized sheaf cohomology, including, in particular, non-abelian generalized versions of [[twisted cohomology]] and of [[equivariant cohomology]].

\linebreak

**Equivariant non-abelian cohomology.** Via the above identification of cohomology sets with homotopy-classes of maps to a classifying space, every flavor of [[homotopy theory]] comes with its corresponding flavor of cohomology theories. 

In *[[equivariant homotopy theory]]* one considers topological spaces $\mathscr{A}$ equipped with the [[group action|action]] $G \curvearrowright \mathscr{A}$ of a (finite, for our purposes) group $G$ and with $G$-equivariant maps between them -- and the corresponding flavor of cohomology is *equivariant cohomology*:
\[
  \label{EquivariantCohomology}
  H^1_G\big(
    X;\,
    \Omega\mathscr{A}
  \big)
  \;\;
  =
  \;\;
  \pi_0
  \, 
  \mathrm{Maps}\big(
    G \curvearrowright X
    ,\,
    G \curvearrowright \mathscr{A}
  \big)^G
  \,.
\]

Here the notion of $G$-homotopy equivalence of maps is straightforward but, at face value, technically cumbersome to reason about. However, [[Elmendorf's theorem]] reveals that $G$-homotopy equivalences (between $G$-cell complexes) are nothing but systems of ordinary weak homotopy equivalences between the $H$-fixed spaces $\mathscr{A}^H$ for all subgroups $H \subset G$. These systems of fixed spaces are conveniently re-packaged as presheaves on a small category called the *[[orbit category]]* $\mathrm{Orb}(G)$ of $G$, whence $G$-equivariant homotopy theory is equivalently the homotopy theory of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|presheaves of spaces]] on $\mathrm{Orb}(G)$.

\linebreak

**Twisted non-abelian cohomology.** 
Somewhat similarly, given any space $\mathscr{B}$ in any homotopy theory, the *[[slice (infinity,1)-category|$\mathscr{B}$-slice]]* is the [[homotopy theory]] whose objects are spaces fibered over $\mathscr{B}$ with maps between them respecting the fibration up to specified homotopy. If we assume, without essential restriction, that the base space is connected, then we may identify it as $\mathscr{B} \,\simeq\, B \mathscr{G}$, as in (eq:DeloopingEquivalence), which exhibits any fibration over it as the [[Borel construction]] $\mathscr{A} \sslash \mathscr{G}$ of the homotopy-quotient of a homotopy-coherent action $\mathscr{G} \acts \mathscr{A}$.

If we now think of a domain object $X \xrightarrow{\tau} B\mathscr{G}$ in this $B \mathscr{G}$-slice as a *twist* and of a codomain object $\mathscr{A} \sslash \mathscr{G} \xrightarrow{p}  B \mathscr{G}$ as a *[[local coefficient bundle]]*, then the corresponding non-abelian cohomology is just the homotopy classes of sections of the $\tau$-associated $\mathscr{A}$-fiber bundle, and as such is $\tau$-twisted $\mathscr{A}$-cohomology:


\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "TwistedNonalianCohomology.jpg",
    "width": 600,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

This works generally: If all spaces here are *in addition* equipped with $G$-actions as in (eq:EquivariantCohomology), hence if we are looking at a slice of equivariant homotopy, then the above is automatically *twisted equivariant* non-abelian cohomology.


\linebreak


**The non-abelian character.**
One famous construction on abelian cohomology is the *[[Chern-Dold character map]]* to [[de Rham cohomology]], which in the case of [[topological K-theory|K-cohomology]] becomes the familar [[Chern character]] (and which on ordinary cohomology is essentially just the [[de Rham theorem]]). 
One may think of the Chern-Dold character as universally extracting the [[torsion subgroup|non-torsion]] data in the [[cohomology groups]]. 
Its generalization to non-abelian cohomology was developed in [FSS23](#FSS23): 

Observing that the Chern-Dold character is essentially just the [[cohomology operation]] induced by  *[[rationalization]]* of the [[classifying space]], 
$$
  \mathscr{A}
  \xrightarrow{
    \phantom{--}
    \eta^{\mathbb{Q}}
    \phantom{--}
  }    
  L^{\!\mathbb{Q}}\mathscr{A}
$$
as such it makes sense in the generality of non-abelian classifying spaces (immediately so under mild technical assumptions, such as [[nilpotent topological space|nilpotency]], but with more work also more generally). In view of this, the [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]] may be re-cast as a *non-abelian de Rham theorem* which identifies, over smooth manifolds $X$, the resulting non-abelian rational cohomology with the [[concordance classes]] of flat differential forms having coefficients in the real [[Whitehead algebra|Whitehead-bracket $L_\infty$-algebra]] $\mathfrak{l}\mathscr{A}$ of the classifying space:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "NonabelianCharacterMap.jpg",
    "width": 670,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Since generalized cohomology theories are typically hard to analyze, in particular non-abelian ones, this character map may be regarded as extracting the first non-trivial stage of more tractable invariants. For instance, the character of a non-abelian class is the first obstruction to a trivialization of that class.

In the mentioned application to physics, the [[flux densities]] of a [[higher gauge field]] are sourced by charges which appear as classes in [[non-abelian de Rham cohomology]] on the right, and the completion of the higher gauge theory by a [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|flux-quantization law]] means to lift these charges through the character map to classes in a chosen non-abelian cohomology theory on the left.

## More history

It was originally apparently [[John Roberts]] who understood (remarkably: while thinking about [[quantum field theory]] in the guise of [[AQFT]]) that general cohomology is about coloring simplices in $\infty$-categories.  

* [[John E. Roberts]], *Mathematical Aspects of Local Cohomology*, in: *Algèbres d’opérateurs et leurs applications en physique mathématique*, Colloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (C.N.R.S) **274**, Paris (1979) 321–332 &lbrack;ISBN:2-222-02441-2, [pdf](https://dmitripavlov.org/scans/roberts-mathematical-aspects-of-local-cohomology.pdf), [[Roberts-LocalCohomology.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

This is recounted in

* [[Ross Street]], pages 9-10 of: *An Australian conspectus of higher category theory*, talk at Institute for Mathematics and its Applications Summer Program: *$n$-Categories: Foundations and Applications* at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, 7–18 June 2004), in: *[[Towards Higher Categories]]*, The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its Applications **152**, Springer (2010) 237-264 &lbrack;[pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/IMA/Street.pdf), [[Street-Conspectus.pdf:file]], [doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1524-5](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-1524-5)&rbrack;


Parallel to this development of the notion of [[descent|descent and codescent]] there was the development of [[homotopical cohomology theory]] as described in

* [[Kenneth S. Brown]], _Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 186 (1973), 419-458 ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schreiber/Abstract%20homotopy%20theory%20and%20generalized%20sheaf%20cohomology.pdf))

The two approaches are different, but closely related. Their relation is via the notion of [[descent|codescent]].

There is a chain of inclusions

$$
  AbelianGroups \hookrightarrow
  ChainComplexesOfAbelianGroups
  \hookrightarrow
  CrossedComplexes
  \hookrightarrow
  \omega Groupoids
  \hookrightarrow
  \omega Categories
$$

along which one can generalize the coefficient objects of ordinary cohomology. (See [[strict omega-groupoid]], [[strict omega-category]]). Since doing so in particular generalizes abelian groups to nonabelian groups (but goes much further!) this is generally addressed as leading to _nonabelian cohomology_.

Depending on the [[model category|models]] chosen, there are different concrete realizations of nonabelian cohomology. 

For instance nonabelian [[Čech cohomology]] played a special role in the motivation of the notion of [[gerbe]]s (see in particular [[gerbe (in nonabelian cohomology)]]), concretely thought of in terms of [[pseudofunctor]]s at least in the context of nonabelian [[group cohomology]], while more abstract (and less explicit) [[homotopy theory]] methods dominate the discussion of [[infinity-stack]]s.

Either way, one obtains a notion of _cohomology on $\infty$-categories with coefficients in $\infty$-catgories_. This is, most generally, the setup of "[[nonabelian cohomology]]".

This is conceptually best understood today in terms of [[Higher Topos Theory|higher topos theory]], using [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-categories of (infinity,1)-sheaves]]. 

This perspective on nonabelian cohomology is discussed for instance in [Toen 02](#Toen02)


## Properties

### Postnikov decomposition and Whitehead principle

In an [[(∞,1)-topos]] every object has a [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category]]. This means that in some sense general nonabelian cohomology can be decomposed into nonabelian cohomology in degree 1 and abelian cohomology in higher degrees, twisted by this nonabelian cohomology. This has been called ([To&#235;n](#Toen02)) the [[Whitehead principle of nonabelian cohomology]].

## Special cases

### Nonabelian group cohomology

Sometimes the term _nonabelian cohomology_ is used in a more restrictive sense. Often people mean 
[[nonabelian group cohomology]] when they say nonabelian cohomology, hence restricting to the domains to [[group|groups]], which are [[groupoid|groupoids]] with a single object.

This kind of nonabelian cohomology is discussed for instance in

* [[John Baez]], [[Mike Shulman]], [[Lectures on n-Categories and Cohomology]] ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)).

That and how ordinary [[group cohomology]] is reproduced from the [[homotopical cohomology theory]] of [[strict omega-groupoid|strict omega-groupoids]] is discussed in detail in chapter 12 of 

* [[Ronnie Brown]], P. Higgins, R. Sivera, [[nonabelian algebraic topology|Nonabelian algebraic topology]].

For more see

* [[nonabelian group cohomology]].



### Nonabelian sheaf cohomology with constant coefficients {#NonabelianSheafCohomology}

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $A$ an [[∞-groupoid]], the standard way to define the [[nonabelian cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is to define it as the intrinsic cohomology as seen in [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]]:

$$
  H(X,A) 
   \;\coloneqq\; 
  \pi_0 Top(X, |A|) \simeq \pi_0 \infty Func(Sing X, A)
  \,,
$$

where $|A|$ is the [[geometric realization]] of $A$ and $Sing X$ the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$.

But both $X$ and $A$ here naturally can be regarded, in several ways, as objects of [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]]es $\mathbf{H} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ over nontrivial [[(∞,1)-site]]s $C$. The intrinsic cohomology of such $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian sheaf cohomology]]. The following discusses two such choices for $\mathbf{H}$ such that the corresponding nonabelian sheaf cohomology coincides with $H(X,A)$ (for [[paracompact space|paracompact]] $X$).

#### Petit $(\infty,1)$-sheaf $(\infty,1)$-topos

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Op(X)$ its [[category of open subsets]] equipped with the canonical structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]], let 

$$
  \mathbf{H}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Op(X))
$$

be the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $X$. The space $X$ itself is naturally identified with the [[terminal object]] $X = * \in Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$. This is the [[petit topos]] incarnation of $X$.

Write

$$
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) :  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
  \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd
$$

be the [[global section]]s terminal [[geometric morphism]]. 

Under the [[constant (∞,1)-sheaf]] functor $LConst$ an an [[∞-groupoid]] $A \in \infty Grpd$ is regarded as an object $LConst A \in Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$. 

There is therefore the _intrinsic_ [[cohomology]] of the $(\infty,1)$-topos $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ with coefficients in the [[constant ∞-stack|constant (∞,1)-sheaf]] on $A$
  
$$
  H'(X,A) 
  \;\coloneqq\; 
  \pi_0 Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X, LConst A)
  \,.
$$

This is [[cohomology with constant coefficients]].

Notice that since $X$ is in fact the [[terminal object]] of $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ and that $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,-)$ is in fact that [[global section]]s functor, this is equivalently

$$
  \cdots \simeq \pi_0 \Gamma LConst A
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

If $X$ is a [[paracompact space]], then these two definitins of [[nonabelian cohomology]] of $X$ with [[constant ∞-stack|constant coefficients]] $A \in \infty Grpd$ agree:

$$
  H(X,A) 
  \;\coloneqq\; 
  \pi_0 \infty Grpd(Sing X,A)  \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,LConst A)
  \,.
$$

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, theorem 7.1.0.1]]. See also [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] for more.


#### Gros $(\infty,1)$-sheaf $(\infty,1)$-topos

Another alternative is to regard the space $X$ as an object in the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[ETop∞Grpd]]. 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv LConst \dashv \Gamma)
  :
  ETop\infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

with the further [[left adjoint]] $\Pi$ to $LConst$ being the intrinsic [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] functor.  The intrinsic [[nonabelian cohomology]] in there also coincides with nonabelian cohomology in [[Top]]; even the full [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]]s are equivalent:

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

For [[paracompact space|paracompact]] $X$ we have an equivalence of [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  ETop\infty Grpd(X, LConst A)
  \simeq
  Top(X, |A|)
$$

and hence in particular an isomorphism on cohomology

$$
  H(X,A) \simeq \pi_0   ETop\infty Grpd(X, LConst A)
$$
