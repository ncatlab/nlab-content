## Definition

A _spinor bundle_ an a [[smooth manifold]] with [[spin structure]] is a $\rho$-[[associated bundle]] associated to the [[spin group]]-[[principal bundle]] lifting the [[tangent bundle]], for $\rho : \mathbf{B} Spin \to $ [[Vect]] a [[representation]] of the [[spin group]].

A [[section]] of a spinor bundle is called a **spinor**.
