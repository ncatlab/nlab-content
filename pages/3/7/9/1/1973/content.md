##Idea 

Any [[abelian category]] $C$ gives rise to an abelian group $K(C)$ called its [[Grothendieck group]] (see there for more).  If we apply this construction to a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] abelian category or generally to a [[rig category]], then $K(C)$ inherits the further [[mathematical structure|structure]] of a [[ring]], thus called the **Grothendieck ring**.

If $C$ is a [[braided monoidal category]], $K(C)$ becomes a [[commutative ring]].

If $C$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $K(C)$ becomes a $\Lambda$-[[Lambda-ring|ring]].

## Definition

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]]. The [[Grothendieck group]] $K(C)$ is the abelian group generated by objects of $C$, quotiented by the relation that $[A]+[B]=[C]$ if there is a short exact sequence

$$0\to A\to C\to B\to 0.$$

In the presence of a [[monoidal category | monoidal]] structure $\otimes$, we can turn $C$ into a ring by defining

$$[A]\cdot [B]=[A\otimes B].$$

This endows $K(C)$ with the structure of a ring because

$$A\otimes(B\oplus C)\cong (A\otimes B)\oplus (A\otimes C),$$

and every monoidal category has a tensor unit.

## Examples

* The Grothendieck ring of the monoidal category of finite [[G-sets]] is called the [[Burnside ring]] of $G$.
