## Idea
In a [[Lawvere theory]], one specifies an algebraic theory by giving a [[small category|small]] [[category]] $T$ with [[finite products]]. Then a [[model]] of the theory is given by a [[functor]] $T \to Set$ that [[preserved limit|preserves]] products. 

A **sketch** is a generalization of this idea, where we take a [[small category]] $T$, and pick some distinguished [[limit]] and [[colimit]] [[cones]]. Then a model of the sketch is a functor that preserves these limits and colimits.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition 

A **sketch** is a [[small category|small]] [[category]] $T$ equipped with a set $L$ of [[cones]] and a set $C$ of [[cocones]].  A **realized sketch** is one where all the cones in $L$ are [[limit]] cones and all the cocones in $C$ are [[colimit]] cocones.

A **limit-sketch** is a sketch with $C = \emptyset$, while a **colimit-sketch** is a sketch with $L = \emptyset$.

A **model of a sketch** in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[functor]] $T\to \mathcal{C}$ taking each cone in $L$ to a limit cone and each cocone in $C$ to a colimit cocone.  In particular, $T$ is realized if and only if its identity functor is a model.  Frequently the notion of model is restricted to the case $\mathcal{C}=Set$.

A [[category]] is called **sketchable** if it is the category of models (in $Set$) of a sketch.

## Examples

###### Example
A [[Lawvere theory]] is a special case of a (limit-)sketch, where the category is one with a distinguished object $X$ such that all objects are ([[isomorphic]] to) powers of $X$, and $C = \emptyset$ and $L$ is the set of all product cones.

###### Proposition 

The categories of models of limit-sketches are the [[locally presentable categories]].

###### Remark

From the discussion there we have that

* an [[accessible category]] is equivalently:
  * a full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a sketch

* a [[locally presentable category]] is equivalently:
  * a *reflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small limits
  * an accessible category with all small colimits

We can "break in half" the difference between the two and define

* a *locally multipresentable category* to be equivalently:
  * a *multireflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit and coproduct* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small *connected* limits
  * an accessible category with all small multicolimits

and

* a *weakly locally presentable category* to be equivalently:
  * a *weakly reflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit and epi* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small products
  * an accessible category with all small weak colimits
