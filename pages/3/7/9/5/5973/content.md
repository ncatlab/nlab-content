## Idea

As [[type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in 1-[[categories]], _2-type theory_ has semantics in [[2-categories]].
In particular, a 2-type theory can have semantics in the 2-category [[Cat]], which would mean that contexts and closed types are modelled as categories.

There are, potentially, many different kinds of "2-type theory" with different uses and semantics.  2-type theory is closely related to (and sometimes the same as) *[[directed type theory]]*.

## Applications

* The "mode theories" in some general approaches to [[modal type theory]] and [[adjoint type theory]] are a form of 2-type theory, where the 2-cells represent a general form of "structural rules" acting on modal judgments.

* The 2-cells in 2-type theory can also be used to model rewriting, e.g. the process of $\beta$-reduction.
