> pp. 121: "What standard
logics of knowledge capture is not actual knowledge, but potential knowledge --- what one
is entitled to know. The switch to potential knowledge means we drop all considerations
of complexity $[...]$ It is easy to see that, under such an assumption, a knowledge modality should be a normal modal
operator. But, what else should be required? $[...]$ All these together make a
knowledge operator obey the S5 conditions."

> p. 198: "Modal epistemic logic, the logic of knowledge, provides a very natural interpretation to the accessibility relation in Kripke models. For an agent $i$, two worlds $w$ and $v$ are connected (written $R_i w v$), if the agent cannot (epistemically) distinguish them. In other words, we have $R_i v w$ if, according to $i$’s information at $w$, the world might as well be in state $v$, or that $v$ is compatible with i’s information at w. Using this interpretation of access, $R_i$ is obviously an equivalence relation. $[...]$ Thus, we are in the realm of the multi-modal logic $S5_m$."

> p. 13: "Formal approaches to epistemology – such as game
theory and computer science – typically assume the S5 conditions for knowledge, which is (partly) explained by the convenient formal properties of the logic. Philosophers typically opt for a weaker notion. Hintikka (1962), for instance, argues that the proper logic for knowledge is the modal system S4"
