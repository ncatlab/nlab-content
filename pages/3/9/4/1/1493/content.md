The term _$\omega$-category_ is used more or less synonymous with [[ ∞-category]], though the two terms appear with different frequency in different parts of the literature.

Originally, $\omega$-categories were introduced as

* [[strict ∞-category|strict ∞-categories]].

There are also 

* [[weak ∞-category|weak ∞-categories]].
