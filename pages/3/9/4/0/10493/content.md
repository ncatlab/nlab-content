###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ out of an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]] is **$n$-excisive** for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (or polynomial of degree at most $n$) if whenever $X$ is a strongly cocartesian $(n + 1)$-[[cube]] in $\mathcal{C}$, $F(X)$ is a cartesian cube in $\mathcal{D}$. 
 

A 1-excisive (∞,1)-functor is called just _[[excisive (∞,1)-functor|excisive]]_ for short.

###### Remark

This notion is comparable to how a [[polynomial]] of degree at most $n$ is determined by its values on $n + 1$ distinct points. This comparison is developed by the concept of a [[polynomial (∞,1)-functor]].
