##  Idea 

The 2-category [[Cat|$Cat$]] of [[categories]] embeds [[fully faithfully]] into the 2-category $Multicat$ of [[multicategories]] in two ways:

1. As the unary multicategories (i.e. in which every multimorphism has unary domain).
2. Via the "discrete cocones" construction, in which we define the multimorphisms of the multicategory $C_\blacktriangleright$ induced by a category $C$ by
\begin{equation}
C_\blacktriangleright(X_1, \ldots, X_n; Y) := C(X_1, Y) \times \cdots \times C(X_n, Y)
\end{equation}

A multicategory is isomorphic to one induced by the discrete cocones construction exactly when it is a [[generalized multicategory]] relative to the [[monad]] on [[Prof]] whose algebras are categories with (strict) finite coproducts, i.e. a "virtual cocartesian category".  Thus, such a multicategory is called a a *cocartesian multicategory**.

An older name for a cocartesian multicategory is a **sequential multicategory**, since its multimorphisms are sequences of unary morphisms.

## Equivalence of definitions

\begin{theorem}
For a [[symmetric multicategory]] $E$ the following are equivalent.

1. $E \cong C_\blacktriangleright$ for some category $C$ (which then must be the category of unary morphisms in $E$).
2. Every object of $E$ is a [[monoid object]], in a way that commutes with all the multimorphisms of $E$.
3. $E$ is equipped with

   * "coduplication" or "codiagonal" or "cocontraction" operations
     $$E(\dots, X, \dots) \to E(\dots, X,X,\dots)$$
   * "insertion" or "strengthening" operations
     $$E(\dots, X,\dots) \to E(\dots, \dots)$$

   satisfying certain evident axioms.
4. $E$ has the structure of a virtual $T$-algebra, where $T$ is the monad on [[Prof]] whose algebras are cocartesian strict monoidal categories.

\end{theorem}

## Properties

- Being cocartesian is a *property* of a multicategory, in contrast to being a [[cartesian multicategory]], which is *structure*.

- Every cocartesian multicategory has the structure of a [[symmetric multicategory]].

- A cocartesian multicategory $C_\blacktriangleright$ is [[representable multicategory|representable]] if and only if $C$ has coproducts (Example 8.8(2) of [Hermida 2000](#Hermida)). This is another motivation for the terminology.

- A category $C$ is [[preadditive category|preadditive]] if and only if its corresponding cocartesian multicategory $C_\blacktriangleright$ is [[cartesian multicategory|cartesian]] (see [Pisani 2013](#Pisani13) and [Pisani 2014](#Pisani14)); and is hence [[additive category|additive]] if and only if its corresponding multicategory is cartesian and representable.

- The discrete cocones construction $(-)_\blacktriangleright : Cat \to Multicat$ is left adjoint to the [[category of monoids]] construction $Mon : Multicat \to Cat$, and this restricts to [[cartesian multicategories]]. In fact, this is a consequence of the more general fact that $Multicat$ is [[copowered]] over $Cat$: see [Pisani 2013](#Pisani13) and [Pisani 2014](#Pisani14).
