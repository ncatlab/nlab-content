## Idea

*Georgias* is a dialogue on rhetoric by [[Plato]]. The main characters are Socrates and Gorgias, a sophist who teaches rhetoric to young people.

## The topic

Whereas for Socrates a discussion is about progressing together towards the truth regarding a concrete question, for Gorgias it is more about convincing each other, with the clarification of the actual question just being part of the process.

Thus, the dialogue can be seen as a _mise en abyme_ of the subject it is discussing. Early in the dialogue, Plato specifies the conditions of a good discussion between two partners. Perhaps, it would be good to agree on this before any discussion, including mathematical discussions.

> SOCRATES: You, Gorgias, like myself, have had great experience of disputations, and you must have observed, I think, that they do not always terminate in mutual edification, or in the definition by either party of the subjects which they are discussing; but disagreements
are apt to arise -- somebody says that another has not spoken truly or clearly; and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel, both parties conceiving that their opponents are arguing from personal feeling only and jealousy of themselves, not from any interest in the question at issue. And sometimes they will go on abusing one another until the company at last are quite vexed at themselves for ever listening to such fellows. Why do I say this? Why, because I cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about rhetoric. And I am afraid to point this out to you, lest you should think that I have some animosity against you, and that I speak, not for the sake of discovering the truth, but from jealousy of you. Now if you are one of my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you alone. And what is my sort? you will ask. **I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute; for I hold that this is the greater gain of the
two, just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another. For I imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are speaking; and if you claim to be one of my sort, let us have the discussion out, but if you would rather have done, no matter;--let us make an end of it.**
