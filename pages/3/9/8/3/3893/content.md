> In the wake of the movement of ideas which followed the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], I was led to introduce the notion of new geometries, more general than [[Riemannian geometry]], and playing with respect to the different [[Klein geometries]] the same role as the [[Riemannian geometries]] play with respect to [[Euclidean space]]. The vast synthesis that I realized in this way depends  of course on the ideas of [[Felix Klein|Klein]] formulated in his celebrated [[Erlangen program|Erlangen programme]] while at the same time going far beyond it since it includes [[Riemannian geometry]], which had formed a completely isolated branch of geometry, within the compass of a very general scheme in which the notion of [[group]] still plays a fundamental role.

## Idea

**Cartan geometry** is [[geometry]] of [[spaces]] that are locally (infinitesimally, tangentially) like [[coset spaces]] $G/H$, i.e. like [[Klein geometries]].  Intuitively, Cartan geometry studies the geometry of a [[manifold]] by 'rolling without sliding' the 'model geometry' $G/H$ along it. Hence Cartan geometry may be thought of as the globalization of the program of [[Klein geometry]] initiated in the [[Erlangen program]].


Cartan geometry subsumes many types of geometry, such as notably [[Riemannian geometry]], [[conformal geometry]], [[parabolic geometry]] and many more. As a Cartan geometry is defined by [[principal connection]] data (hence by [[cocycles]] in [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] [[differential cohomology]]) this means that it serves to express all these kinds of geometries in connection data. 

This is used notably in the [[first order formulation of gravity]], which was the motivating example in the original text ([Cartan 22](#Cartan23)). The [[physics]] literature tends to use the term "Cartan moving frame method" instead of "Cartan geometry".



## Definition

A _Cartan geometry_ is a space equipped with a _[[Cartan connection]]_. See there for more.
