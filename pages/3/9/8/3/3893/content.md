## Idea

**Cartan geometry** is [[geometry]] of [[spaces]] that are locally (infinitesimally, tangentially) like [[coset spaces]] $G/H$, i.e. like [[Klein geometries]].  Intuitively, Cartan geometry studies the geometry of a [[manifold]] by 'rolling without sliding' the 'model geometry' $G/H$ along it. Hence Cartan geometry may be thought of as the globalization of the program of [[Klein geometry]] initiated in the [[Erlangen program]].


Cartan geometry subsumes many types of geometry, such as notably [[Riemannian geometry]], [[conformal geometry]], [[parabolic geometry]] and many more. As a Cartan geometry is defined by [[principal connection]] data (hence by [[cocycles]] in [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] [[differential cohomology]]) this means that it serves to express all these kinds of geometries in connection data. This is used notably in the [[first order formulation of gravity]], which was the motivating example in the original text ([Cartan 32](#Cartan23)).



## Definition

A _Cartan geometry_ is a space equipped with a _[[Cartan connection]]_. See there for more.
