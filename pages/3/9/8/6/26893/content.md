## Idea

Similar to how [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in [[cohesive (infinity,1)-toposes]], **fractured homotopy type theory** should be [[modal type theory|modal]] [[homotopy type theory]] with categorical semantics in [[fractured (infinity,1)-toposes]]. 

As [[condensed mathematics]] is conjectured to take place in fractured (infinity,1)-toposes (see at [[condensed local contractibility]]), it can presumably be done using the syntax of fractured homotopy type theory.
