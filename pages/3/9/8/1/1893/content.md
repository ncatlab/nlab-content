$\Lambda$ is the ring of symmetric functions in countably many variables. A **$\Lambda$-ring** is a [[P-ring]] for $P = \Lambda$.

$\Lambda$-rings are also called $\lambda$-rings. 


###Idea###

In many situations, we can take direct sums of representations of some algebraic gadget.  So, decategorifying, the set of isomorphism classes of representations becomes a commutative monoid. But nobody likes commutative monoids.  So, we throw in formal negatives and get an abelian group &#8212; the so-called Grothendieck group.

In many situations, we can also take tensor products of representations.  Then our Grothendieck group becomes something better than an abelian group.  It becomes a ring: the representation ring. But, we're not done!  In many situations we can also take exterior and symmetric powers of representations.  Indeed, we can often apply any Young diagram to a representation and get a new representation! Then our representation ring becomes something better than a ring.  It becomes a $\Lambda$-ring!

More generally, the Grothendieck group of a monoidal abelian category is always a ring, but if we start with a symmetric monoidal abelian category, we get a $\Lambda$-ring. So, $\Lambda$-rings are all about getting the most for your money when you decategorify a symmetric monoidal abelian category -- for example the category of representations of a group, or the category of vector bundles on a space.

##Connection to arithmetic##

>The theory of $\Lambda$-rings, in the sense of Grothendieck's Riemann-Roch theory, is an enrichment of the theory of commutative rings. In the same way, we can enrich usual algebraic geometry over the ring Z of integers to produce $\Lambda$-algebraic geometry. We show that $\Lambda$-algebraic geometry is in a precise sense an algebraic geometry over a deeper base than Z and that it has many properties predicted for algebraic geometry over the mythical field with one element. Moreover, it does this is a way that is both formally robust and closely related to active areas in arithmetic algebraic geometry.
