## Idea

_Finitely complete $(\infty,1)$-categories_ are the analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of [[finitely complete categories]] in [[category theory]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #FinitelyCompleteInfinityCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. This is called a _finitely complete $(\infty,1)$-category_ if  $\mathcal{C}$ has [[finite (∞,1)-limits]], i.e. 

* if it has a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]] and [[homotopy fiber products]];
* if it has a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] and for every [[object]] $x \in C$, the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[products]].

## Properties

The (∞,1)-category of [[setoid objects]] of a finitely complete (∞,1)-category is an [[exact (∞,1)-category]]. This corresponds to the fact that in [[intensional type theory]], [[types]] represent [[infinity-groupoids]] and the [[setoids]] are the [[exact completion]] of types.
