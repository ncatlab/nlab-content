Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the set of **polynomials** in one variable with coefficients in $R$ consists of all formal expressions

$$ a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

where $n$ is an arbitrary [[natural number]] and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$, [[quotient set|modulo]] the [[equivalence relation]] generated by equations of the form

$$ 0 z^{n+1} + a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

(so that we ignore coefficients of zero).

These polynomials also form a commutative ring, denoted $R[z]$; the addition and multiplication in this ring are defined in the obvious way.

The ring $R[z]$ may also be described more abstractly as the free $R$-[[commutative algebra|algebra]] on one generator.

Similarly, the set of polynomials in any give [[set]] of variables with coefficients in $R$ is the free commutative $R$-algebra on that set of generators.
