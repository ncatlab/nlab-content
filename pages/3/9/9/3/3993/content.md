## Idea

A **Horn theory** is a [[theory]] in which every [[axiom]] has a certain special form.

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[signature (in logic)|signature]]. A **[[term]]** of $\Sigma$ is an expression built out of [[variables]] and [[function symbols]]. (For example, $x y^{-1} z$ is a term in the language of [[groups]].) An **atomic formula** relative to $\Sigma$ is a formula that consists of a [[relation symbol]] of $\Sigma$ (including [[equality]]) applied to terms. 

A **Horn clause** is a logical expression of the form 

$$\phi_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \phi_n \vdash \phi$$ 

where each $\phi_i$ and $\phi$ is atomic. A (universal) **Horn theory** is a [[theory]] in which every [[axiom]] is a Horn clause.
