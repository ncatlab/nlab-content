## Idea

A _relative monad_ is what is to a _[[relative adjunction]]_ as a [[monad]] is to an [[adjunction]].

In [ACU14](#ACU14), the authors proved that a relative monad on a functor $J \colon \mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ are 'skew-monoids in the [[skew-monoidal category]] $[\mathbf J, \mathbf C]$' (see below).

The specialization of the following definition to plain monads, hence to the case $J = id$, yields at face value not the traditional definition of [[monads]] but the (equivalent) definition of *[[extension systems]]* (also "[[Kleisli triples]]", being the form of [[monads in computer science]]).


## Definition

Let $\mathbf J, \mathbf C$ be categories and $J: \mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ be a functor.

\begin{definition}
\label{def}
A **relative monad $T$ on $J$** is a functor $T:\mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ equipped with

* a _unit_ $\eta_X : J X \to T X$ natural in $X : \mathbf J$,
* a _[[extension system|Kleisli extension]]_ $(-)^* : \mathbf C(J X, T Y) \to \mathbf C(T X, T Y)$ in both $X,Y:\mathbf J$

such that for every $X,Y,Z:\mathbf J$ and $k:J X \to T Y$,

* _(left unital law)_ $k = k^* \circ \eta_X$,
* _(right unital law)_ $\eta_X^* = 1_{T X}$,
* _(associativity law)_ $(\ell^* \circ k)^* = \ell^* \circ k^*$ for every $\ell : J Y \to T Z$.

\end{definition}

Notice that for any $f:X \to Y$ in $\mathbf J$, one has
\[
    Tf = (\eta_{J Y} \circ J f)^*.
\]

In computer science, monads are usually defined by a unit and an extension operator, as above, so that relative monads are very close to plain monads in that regard. Since $[\mathbf J, \mathbf C]$ lacks a monoidal structure (unlike $[\mathbf C, \mathbf C]$), to define relative monads like mathematicians define monads (as monoids in a category of endofunctors) we need to be more clever.

### As skew-monoids
A [[skew-monoidal category]] is like a monoidal category except its unitors and associators are not necessarily invertible. A monoid in a skew-monoidal category is called a 'skew-monoid'.

Composition of functors $F,G:\mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ can be defined by first [[left Kan extension|extending]] $F$ along $J$ and then composing with $G$. The resulting composition product on $[\mathbf J, \mathbf C]$ is coherent but only laxly so, hence the need to appeal to skew-monoidal categories.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 3.4]
Suppose $J:\mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ is such that $\mathrm{Lan}_J : [\mathbf J, \mathbf C] \to [\mathbf C, \mathbf C]$ exists (e.g. if $\mathbf J$ is small and $\mathbf C$ cocomplete).
Then $[\mathbf J, \mathbf C]$ is skew-monoidal, with unit $J$ and product $F \circ^J G = (\mathrm{Lan}_J F) \circ G$, and a relative monad is a monoid in $([\mathbf J, \mathbf C], J, \circ^J)$.
\end{theorem}

When $J:\mathbf J \to \mathbf C$ is a free completion of $\mathbf{J}$ under colimits from some set $\mathcal{F}$ of indexing types, then this skew-monoidal structure on $[\mathbf J, \mathbf C]$ is properly monoidal, since it is equivalent to the $\mathcal{F}$-colimit preserving functors $\mathbf C\to\mathbf C$, and the monoidal structure is just functor composition. 

## Examples

* A relative monad on the embedding $J:\mathbf{FinSet} \to \mathbf {Set}$ is the same thing as an [[abstract clone]]. These are equivalent to [[finitary monads]] and single-sorted [[algebraic theories]]. 

* Any monad $T$ on $\mathbf{C}$ induces a relative monad $TJ$ on $J$, for any $J:\mathbf{J}\to \mathbf{C}$. 

* Fixing a category $\mathbb{V}$ with finite products, to give a [[Freyd category]] is to give a strong relative monad on the [[Yoneda embedding]] $\mathbb{V}\to [\mathbb{V}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}]$. 

* The presheaf construction $(\mathbb{C}\mapsto [{\mathbb{C}}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}])$ can be regarded as a [[relative pseudomonad]] on the inclusion $\mathbf{Cat}\to \mathbf{CAT}$. (See also [[Yoneda structures]].)

* A [[monad with arities|monad on $\mathbf C$ with arities in $\mathbf{J}\subseteq \mathbf C$]] is the same thing as a relative monad for the embedding $\mathbf{J}\to \mathbf C$. (Here $\mathbf{J}\subseteq \mathbf{C}$ is required to be a [[dense subcategory]], so that to give a functor $\mathbf{J}\subseteq \mathbf{C}$ is to give a functor $\mathbf{C}\to\mathbf{C}$ preserving $J$-absolute colimits.)
