## Idea

This approach to [[quantum mechanics]] assigns probabilities to various alternative histories of measurements on a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is claimed to resolve what is generally taken to be paradoxical about quantum mechanics, such as the supposed collapse of the wave-function.

Measurements in this approach are typically understood in terms of [[quantum decoherence]], hence an alternative name _decoherent histories_.
