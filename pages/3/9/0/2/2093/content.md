## Idea

The _Gelfand spectrum_ of a commutative [[C-star algebra]] $A$ is a [[topological space]] $X$ such that $A$ is [[generalized the|the]] algebra of complex-valued [[continuous functions]] on $X$. (This "[[Gelfand duality]]" is a special case of the general [[Isbell duality|duality between spaces and their algebras of functions]].)


## Definition

Given a unital, not necessarily commutative, complex $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebra]] $A$, the set of its continuous _[[character]]s_, that is continuous nonzero linear homomorphisms into the field of [[complex number]]s, is canonically equipped with a so-called __spectral topology__ which is [[compactum|compact Hausdorff]]. (If applied to a nonunital $C^*$-algebra, then it is only [[locally compact space|locally compact]].) This correspondence extends to a [[functor]], called the __Gel'fand spectrum__ (also Gelfand, originally &#1043;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1092;&#1072;&#1085;&#1076;) from the category of unital $C^*$-algebras to the category of Hausdorff spaces, which is full and faithful when restricted to the subcategory of commutative unital $C^*$-algebras. The [[kernel]] of a character is clearly a codimension-$1$ closed subspace, and in particular a closed [[maximal ideal]] in $A$; therefore the Gel'fand spectrum is a topologised analogue of the [[maximal spectrum]] of a discrete algebra.

There is some redundancy, because a character on a unital Banach algebra is automatically continuous (with Lipschitz constant 1).  I wasn't sure if I should remove the word or if it is there for emphasis.

For noncommutative $C^*$-algebras the spaces of equivalence classes of irreducible representations (i.e., the spectrum) and their kernels (i.e., the primitive ideal space) are more important than the character space.  Should that be mentioned here?  The Gelfand spectrum is also useful in the context of more general commutative Banach algebras.
