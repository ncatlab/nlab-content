Given a unital, not necessarily commutative, $C^*$-algebra $A$, the set of its continuous _characters_, that is continuous nonzero linear homomorphisms into the field of complex numbers, is canonically equipped with a so-called __spectral topology__ which is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. This correspondence extends to a functor, called __Gel'fand spectrum__ (or Gelfand spectrum) from the category of unital $C^*$-algebras to the category of Hausdorff spaces, which is full and faithful when restricted to the subcategory of commutative unital $C^*$-algebra. Kernel of a character is clearly a codimension 1 closed subspace, and in particular a closed maximal ideal in $A$; therefore the Gel'fand spectrum is an analogue of a [[maximal spectrum]] of a discrete algebra.
