## Idea

This entry is about the properties and the characterization of the category $Sh(S)$ of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on a ([[small category|small]]) [[site]] $S$, which is a [[Grothendieck topos]].  Among other things it gives a definition and a characterization of the notion of [[sheaf]] itself, but for more details [[sheaf|sheaves]] themselves see there. 

## Definition

Let $(C,J)$ be a [[site]]: a (small) [[category]] equipped with a [[coverage]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Definition

The **category of sheaves** on $(C,J)$ is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[category of presheaves]] 

$$
  i : Sh_J(C) \hookrightarrow
  PSh(C)
$$

on those presheaves which are [[sheaves]] with respect to $J$.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Every category of sheaves is a [[reflective subcategory]]

$$
  (L \dashv i) : Sh_J(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  Psh(C)
  \,,
$$

hence a [[subtopos]] of the [[presheaf topos]].  Moreover, every such subtopos arises in this way: there is a [[bijection]] between [[Grothendieck topologies]] on $C$ and equivalence classes of [[geometric embedding]]s into $PSh(C)$.

=--

This appears for instance as ([Johnstone, corollary 2.1.11](#Johnstone)).  See also [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Details on the first statement are at [[sheafification]]. A full proof for the second statement is at [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] (there proven in [[(∞,1)-category theory]], but the proof is verbatim the same in [[category theory]]).

## Properties


### As localizations

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The category of sheaves is equivalent to the [[homotopy category]] of the [[category with weak equivalences]] $PSh(C)$ with the weak equivalences given by $W = $[[local isomorphisms]]

$$
  Sh(S) \simeq Ho_{PSh(S)} = PSh(C)[local isomorphisms]^{-1}
  \,.
$$

The converse is also true: for every [left exact functor]] $L : PSh(S) \to PSh(S)$ (preserving finite limits) which is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to the inclusion of its image, there is a Grothendieck topology on $S$ such that the image of $L$ is the category of sheaves on $S$ with respect to that topology.

=--

### As toposes

Categories of sheaves are examples of [[categories]] that are [[topos]]es: they are the [[Grothendieck topos]]es characterized among all toposes as those satisfying [[Grothendieck topos|Giraud's axioms]].

+-- {: .standout}

[[Grothendieck topos|Sheaf toposes]] are precisely the [[geometric embedding|subtoposes]] of [[presheaf]] toposes.

=--

This appears for instance as 
([Johnstone, corollary 2.1.11](#Johnstone)).


### Dependence on the site

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Definition

For $(L \dashv i) : \mathcal{E} \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}$ a category of sheaves and $(C,J)$ a [[site]] such that we have an equivalence of categories $\mathcal{E} \simeq Sh_J(C)$ we say that $C$ is a **site of definition** for the [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

There are always different [[site]]s $(C,J)$ whose categories of sheaves are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]. First of all for fixed $C$ and given a [[coverage]] $J$, the category of sheaves depends only on the [[Grothendieck topology]] generated by $J$. But there may be site structures also on inequivalent categories $C$ that have equivalent categories of sheaves.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop #InducedCoverage}
###### Definition

For $(C,J)$ a [[site]] with [[coverage]] $J$ and $D \to C$ any [[subcategory]], the **induced coverage** $J_D$ on $D$ has as [[covering]] [[sieve]]s the intersections of the covering sieves of $C$ with the morphisms in $D$.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop #DenseSubSite}
###### Definition

Let $(C,J)$ be a [[site]] (possibly [[large site|large]]). A [[subcategory]] $D \to C$ (not necessarily full) is called a **[[dense sub-site]]** with the [induced coverage](#InducedCoverage) $J_D$ if

1. every object $U \in C$ has a [[covering]] $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $J$ with all $U_i$ in $D$;

1. for every morphism $f : U \to d$ in $C$ with $d \in D$ there is a [[covering]] family $\{f_i : U_i \to U\}$ such that the composites $f \circ f_i$ are in $D$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

If $D$ is a [[full subcategory]] then the second condition is automatic.

=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(comparison lemma)**

Let $(C,J)$ be a (possibly [[large site|large]]) [[site]] with $C$ a [[locally small category]] and let $f : D \to C$ be a [[small category|small]] [dense sub-site](#DenseSubSite). Then pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) 
    : 
  PSh(D)
    \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}  
   PSh(C)
$$

with $f^*$ given by precomposition with $f$ and $f_*$ given by right [[Kan extension]] induces an [[equivalence of categories]] between the categories of sheaves

$$
  (f_* \dashv f^*) : 
  Sh_{J_D}(D)
  \underoverset
    {\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\overset{f^*}
    {\leftarrow}}
    {\simeq}
  Sh_J{C}
  \,.
$$


=--

This appears as ([Johnstone, theorm C2.2.3](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .un_examples}
###### Examples


* Let $X$ be a [[locale]] with [[frame]] $Op(X)$ regarded as a site with the canonical coverage (\{U_i \to U\} covers if the [[join]] of the $U_i$ us $U$). Let $bOp(X)$ be a [[basis for the topology]] of $X$: a complete join-[[semilattice]] such that every object of $Op(X)$ is the [[join]] of objects of $bOp(X)$. Then $bOp(X)$ is a dense sub-site.

  * For $X$ a [[locally contractible space]], $Op(X)$ its [[category of open subsets]] and $cOp(X)$ the full subcategory of [[contractible]] open subsets, we have that $cOp(X)$ is a dense sub-site.

* For $C = TopManifold$  the category of all [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] [[topological manifold]]s equipped with the [[open cover]] coverage, the category [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$ is a dense sub-site: every paracompact manifold has a [[good open cover]] by [[open balls]] [[homeomorphic]] to a [[Cartesian space]].

* Similaryl for $C = $ [[Diff]] the category of [[smooth manifold]]s equipped with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]], the full subcategory [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$ is a dense sub-site.

### Epi- mono- and isomorphisms


Let $Sh(C)$ be a category of sheaves.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ is a [[monomorphism]] if it is a monomorphism of [[presheaves]], that is if for each $U \in C$ the [[function]] $f(U) : X(U) \to Y(U)$ is [[injective]].

=--


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $Sh(C)$ is an [[epimorphism]] precisely if it is **locally surjective** in the sense that:

for all $U \in C$ there is a [[covering]] $\{p_i : U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}$ such that for all $i \in I$ and every element $y \in Y(U)$ the element $f(p_i)(y)$ is in the image of $f(U_i) : X(U_i) \to Y(U_i)$.

where it is implied by the combination of Corollary VII 4.7 and theorem V.4.1.

It's a bit odd that the full final statement does not seem to be stated there explicitly, but all the ingredients are discussed:

* exercise 16.7 shows that [[sheafification]] inverts precisely the [[local isomorphism]]s, so that in particular every [[local isomorphism]] between [[sheaf|sheaves]] is an [[isomorphism]];

* lemma 16.3.2 states that the unit of the [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] $Id_{PSh(S)} \rightarrow i \circ \bar{(-)} : PSh(S) \to PSh(S)$ is componentwise a [[local isomorphism]];

* using this corollary 7.2.2 says that $Sh(S) \simeq Ho_{PSh(S)}$ with the [[homotopy category]] $Ho_{PSh(S)}$ formed using [[local isomorphism]]s as weak equivalences.
