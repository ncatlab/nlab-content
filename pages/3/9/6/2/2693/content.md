#Defintion#

Write $Ring^\Delta$ for the [[category]] of [[cosimplicial object]]s in the category of [[ring]]s.

The  **projective** [[model category]] structure on $Ring^\Delta$ is given by setting:

* weak equivalences are the morphism that induce [[isomorphism]]s on all [[cohomotopy group]]s

* fibrations are the degreewise surjections.


#References#

For commutative rings this is in

* [[Bertrand Toen]], _Affine stacks (Champs affines)_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0012219))

The generalization to arbitrary cosimplicial rings is proposition 9.2 of

* J.L. Castiglioni G. Corti&#241;as, _Cosimplicial versus DG-rings: a version of the Dold-Kan correspondence_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv1.library.cornell.edu/abs/math/0306289v2))

There also aspects of relation to the [[model structure on dg-algebras]] is discussed. (See [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] for more on this).
