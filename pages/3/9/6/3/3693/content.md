**Airy function** is a special function satisfying [[ordinary differential equation]]

$$
y'' - xy = 0 
$$

and with integral representation

$$
Ai(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty cos(\frac{t^3}{3}+tx) dt 
$$

This function appears often in the study of oscillating integrals, e.g. in [[semiclassical approximation]] to [[quantum mechanics]] and in the geometric approximation to the wave optics. It asymptotics is important in the study of the singular behaviour of light in the vicinity of caustics. Asymptotic expansions for the Airy function have sharp changes at certain lines, observed by G. G. Stokes, and present often in the stationary phase method (cf. [[semiclassical approximation]]). This is called the [[Stokes phenomenon]] and is a special case of the [[wall crossing]].

Airy function has also a remarkable role in the [[Kontsevich]]'s solution to the Witten conjecture.
