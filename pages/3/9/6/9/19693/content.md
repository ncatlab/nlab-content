
_Green\'s Theorem_ (also _the Green Theorem_, but that is easily misunderstood in English) is the classical version of the [[Stokes Theorem]] for [[surfaces]] in the [[plane]] (which just amounts to regions in $\mathbb{R}^2$).  It is in a way the most basic form of the Stokes Theorem beyond the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]], containing all of the [[analysis|analytic]] subtleties.  The classical [[Kelvin–Stokes Theorem]] (for surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$) is a direct corollary (as indeed is the Stokes Theorem for surfaces in any ambient manifold); the other forms are proved in an analogous fashion.  Other corollaries include the [[Cauchy integral theorem]] and the equality of mixed [[partial derivatives]].
