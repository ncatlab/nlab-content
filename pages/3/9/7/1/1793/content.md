## Idea

Model structures on chain complexes are [[model category]] structures on [[categories of chain complexes]] whose weak equivalences are [[quasi-isomorphisms]].  (There is  also a [[Hurewicz model structure on chain complexes]] whose weak equivalences are [[chain homotopy equivalences]].)


Via these model structures, all of the standard techniques in [[homological algebra]], such as [[injective resolutions]] and [[projective resolutions]], are special cases of constructions in [[homotopy theory]], such as [[cofibrant resolutions]] and [[fibrant resolutions]].

The existence of these model structures depends subtly on whether the chain complexes in question are bounded or not.

### In non-negative degree


[[chain complex|Chain complexes]] in non-negative degree in an [[abelian category]] $A$ are special in that they may be identified via the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] as [[simplicial object]]s in $A$.

$$
  Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(A) \simeq A^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

Similarly, [[cochain complex|cochain complexes]] are identified with [[cosimplicial object]]s

$$
  Ch^{\bullet \geq 0}(A) \simeq A^{\Delta}
  \,.
$$

At least if $A$ is the category of [[abelian groups]], so that $A^{\Delta^{op}}$ is the category of abelian [[simplicial group]]s it inherits naturally a model category structure from the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], which [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presents]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s.

The model structure on chain complexes transports this presentation  of the special $\infty$-groupoids given by abelian simplicial groups along the Dold-Kan correspondence to chain complexes.

Analogous statements apply to the category of unbounded chain complexes and the canonical [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] [[Spec]] of [[spectrum|spectra]].

This we discuss below in

* _[In non-negative degree](#CochainNonNeg)_

### For unbounded chain complexes

Model structures on unbounded (co)chain complexes can be understood as
presentations of [[spectrum objects]] in model structures of bounded (co)chain complexes.

See

* _[For unbounded chain complexes](#ForUnboundedChainComplexes)_


## Definitions

### In non-negative degree
 {#CochainNonNeg}

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]].

Recall that by the dual [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] the category $C^\Delta$ of [[cosimplicial object]]s in $C$ is equivalent to the category $Ch^\bullet_+(C)$ of [[cochain complexes]] in non-negative degree. This means that we can transfer results discussed at [[model structure on cosimplicial objects]] to cochain complexes (see [Bousfield2003, section 4.4](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0312/0312531v1.pdf) for more).

There is a [[model category]] structure on the [[category of chain complexes]]

The projective model structure on $Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}$ is originally due to
([Quillen 67, II.4, pages II.4.11, II.4.12](#Quillen67)).
See also ([Goerss-Schemmerhorn 06, Theorem 1.5](#GoerssSchemmerhorn06), [Dungan 10, 2.4.2, proof in section 2.5](#Dungan10)).

There is a [[model category]] structure on non-negatively graded [[cochain complexes]]  $Ch^{\bullet \geq 0 }(\mathcal{A})$ whose

* weak equivalences are [[quasi-isomorphisms]];

* cofibrations are the morphisms that are [[monomorphisms]] in $R Mod$ in each _[[positive number|positive]]_ degree;

###### Remark

This means that a chain complex $C_\bullet \in Ch_{\bullet}(\mathcal{A})$ is a [[cofibrant object]] in the projective model structure, theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructure}, precisely if it consists of [[projective modules]]. Accordingly, a [[cofibrant resolution]] in the projective model structure is precisely what in [[homological algebra]] is called a _[[projective resolution]]_. Dually for [[fibrant resolutions]] in the injective model structure, theorem \ref{InjectiveModelStructure}, and [[injective resolutions]] in homological algebra.

This way the traditional definition of [[derived functor in homological algebra]] relates to the general construction of [[derived functors]] in [[model category]] theory. See there for more details. Similar comments apply to the various other model structures below.

#### Resolution model structures

There are _resolution model structures_ on cosimplicial objects in a model category, due to ([DwyerKanStover](#DwyerKanStover)), reviewed in ([Bousfield](#Bousfield))

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $A$ be an [[abelian category]] and let $\mathcal{G} \in Obj(A)$ be a [[class]] of objects, such that $A$ has enough $\mathcal{G}$-[[injective object]]s.

Then there is a model category structure on non-negatively graded cochain complexes $Ch^{\bullet \geq 0}(A)_{\mathcal{G}}$ whose

* weak equivalences are maps $f : X \to Y$ such that for each $K \in A$ the induced map $A(Y,K) \to A(X,K)$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of chain complexes of abelian groups;

* $f$ is a cofibration if it is $\mathcal{G}$-monic in positive degree;

* $f$ is a fibration if it is degreewise a [[split epimorphism]] with degreewise $\mathcal{G}$-injective kernel.

=--

See [Bousfield2003, section 4.4](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0312/0312531v1.pdf).

If $A$ has enough [[injective object]]s and $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of all of them, this reproduces the
[standard Quillen model structure](#StandardQuillenOnBounded) discussed above:

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

Let $A$ be an [[abelian category]] with enough [[injective object]]s. Then there is a model category structure on non-negatively graded cochain complexes $Ch^{\geq 0}(A)$ whose

* weak equivalences are the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s;

* fibrations are the morphisms that are [[epimorphism]]s with injective [[kernel]] in each degree;

* cofibrations are the morphisms which are [[monomorphism]]s in $A$ in each _positive_ degree.

=--

If we take $\mathcal{G}$ to be the class of all objects of $A$ this gives the following structure.

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

There is a model structure on $Ch^{\bullet\geq 0}(A)_{tot}$ whose

* weak equivalences are cochain [[homotopy equivalence]]s;

* fibrations are the morphisms that are degreewise [[split epimorphism]]s and whose [[kernel]]s are [[injective object]]s;

* cofibration are the morphisms that are in positive degree [[monomorphism]]s.

###### Example

If $C = $ [[Vect]] is a category of [[vector space]]s over some [[field]], we have that every epi/mono splits and that every [[quasi-isomorphism]] is a homotopy equivalence.  Moreover, in this case every chain complex is quasi-isomorphic to its [[homology]] (regarded as a chain complex with zero differentials).

This is the model structure which induces the [[transferred model structure|transferred]] [[model structure on dg-algebras]] over a [[field]] that is used in [[rational homotopy theory]].

#### Projective model structure on connective cochain complexes 
  {#CochainNonNegProj}

We discuss a model structure on connective cochain complexes of abelian groups in which the fibrations are the degreewise epis. This follows an analogous proof in ([Jardine 97](model+structure+on+dg-algebras#Jardine97)).


+-- {: .num_theorem #ProjectiveModelStructureOnConnectiveCochainComplexes}

**(projective model structure on connective cochain complexs )**

The category $Ch^{\bullet \geq 0}(Ab)$ of non-negatively graded cochain complexes of [[abelian groups]] becomes a [[model category]] with

* fibrations the degreewise surjections;

* weak equivalences the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.

Moreover this is a [[simplicial model category]]-structure
with respect to the canonical structure of an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]]
induced from the dual [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan equivalence]]
$Ch^\bullet_+(Ab) \simeq Ab^\Delta$ by the fact that $Ab^\Delta$  is a [[category of cosimplicial objects]] (see there) in a category with all limits and colimits.

=--

The first part of this theorem is claimed, without proof, in [Castiglioni-Cortinas 03, Def. 4.7](#CastiglioniCortinas03).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We spell out a proof of the model structure below in a sequence of
lemmas. The proof that this is a simplicial model category is
at [[model structure on cosimplicial abelian groups]].

=--

We record a detailed proof of the model structure on $Ch^{\bullet \geq 0}(Ab)$ with fibrations the degreewise surjections, following the appendix of ([Stel 10](#Stel)).


As usual, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\mathbb{Z}[n]$ for the complex concentrated on the additive group of [[integer]]s in degree $n$, and for $n \geq 1$  write $\mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for the cochain complex $(0 \to \cdots 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \to 0 \cdots)$ with the two copies of $\mathbb{Z}$ in degree $n-1$ and $n$.


For $n = 0$ let $\mathbb{Z}[-1,0] = 0$, for convenience.







+-- {: .num_lemma #ProjStructGenCofibs}
###### Lemma


For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical maps $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ are cofibrations, in that they  have the [[left lifting property]] against acyclic fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let $p : A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B$ be degreewise surjective and an isomorphism on cohomology.

First consider $\mathbb{Z}[0]\to \mathbb{Z}[-1,0] = 0$. We need to construct lifts

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}[0] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $p(f_0(1)) = 0$ we have by using that $p$ is a quasi-iso that $f_0(1) = 0 \; mod\; im d_A$. But in degree 0 this means that $f_0(1) = 0$. And so the unique possible lift in the above diagram does exist.


Consider now $\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for $n \geq 1$. We need to construct a lift in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Such a lift is equivalently an element $\sigma \in A_{n-1}$ such that

* $d_A \sigma = f_n(1)$

* $p_{n-1}(\sigma) = g_{n-1}(1)$.

Since $p$ is a quasi-isomorphism, and since it takes the closed element $f_n(1) \in A_n$ to the exact element $p_n(f_n(1)) = d_B g_{n-1}(1)$ it follows that $f_n(1)$ itself must be exact in that there is $z \in A_{n-1}$ with $d_A z = f_n(1)$. Pick such.

So then $d_B ( p(z) - g_{n-1}(1) ) = 0$ and again using that $p$ is a quasi-isomorphism this means that there must be a closed $a \in A_{n-1}$ such that $p(a) = p(z)- g_{n-1}(1) + d_B b$ for some $b \in B_{n-2}$. Choose such $a$ and $b$.

Since $p$ is degreewise onto, there is $a'$ with $p(a') = b$. Choosing this the above becomes $p(a) = p(z) - g_{n-1}(1) + p(d_A a')$.

Set then

$$
  \sigma := z - a + d_A a'
  \,.
$$

It follows with the above that this satisfies the two conditions on $\sigma$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     d_A \sigma &= d_A z - d_A a + d_A d_A a'
     \\
     & =
     d_A z
     \\
      & = f_n(1)
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     p( \sigma ) &=  p(z) - p(a) + p(d_A a')
     \\
     & = g_{(n-1)}(1)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Finally consider $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ for all $n$. We need to produce lifts in

$$
  \array{
     0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Such a lift is a choice of element $\sigma \in A_n$ such that

* $d_A \sigma = 0$;

* $p(\sigma) = g_n(1)$;

Since $g_n(1)$ is closed and $p$ a surjective quasi-isomorphism, we may find a closed $a \in A_n$ and an $a' \in A_{n-1}$ such that
$p (a) = g_{n}(1) + d_B(p(a'))$. Set then

$$
  \sigma := a - d_A a'
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the morphism $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$
are acyclic cofibrations, in that they have the [[left lifting property]] again all degreewise surjections.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $n = 0$ this is trivial. For $n \geq 1$ a diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is equivalently just any element $g_{n-1}(1) \in B$ and
a lift $\sigma$ accordingly just any element $\sigma \in A$
with $p(\sigma) = g_{n-1}(1)$. Such exists because $p$ is degreewise
surjctive by assumption.

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #ProjStructCharAcyclicFibrations}
###### Lemma


A morphism $f : A \to B$ is an acyclic fibration precisely if it has
the [[right lifting property]] against $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ and
$\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for all $n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By the above lemmas, it remains to show only one direction:
if $f$ has the RLP, then it is an acyclic fibration.

So assume $f$ has the RLP. Then from the existence of the lifts

$$
  \array{
     0 &\to& A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

one deduces that $f$ is degreewise surjective on closed elements.
In particular this means it is surjective in cohomology.

With that, it follows from the existence of all the lifts

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

for $f$ a lift of the closed element $g_n(1)$ that $f$ is
degreewise surjective on all elements.

Moreover, these lifts say that if $f_n(1)$ is any closed element such that
under $p$ it becomes exact ($d_B g_{n-1}(1) = p(f_n(1))$), then it
must already be exact itself ($d_A \sigma_{n-1}(1) = f_n(1)$). Hence
$f$ is also injective on cohomology and hence by the above is
an isomorphism on cohomology.

+-- {: .num_lemma #ProjStrucFactAxiomI}
###### Lemma


Every morphism $f : A \to B$ can be factored as
a morphism with left lifting property against all
fibrations followed by a fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Apply the [[small object argument]]-reasoning to the
maps in $ J = \{0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]\}$.

Since for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a morphism $\mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]\to B$
corresponds to an element $b \in B_n$. From the commuting
diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}}
    \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1] &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    B
  }
$$

one obtains a factorization through its [[pushout]]

$$
  \array{
     && A
     \\
       &{}^{\mathllap{j}}\swarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     A \coprod \coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}}
     \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     &\searrow_{p}& \downarrow
     \\
     && B
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $j$ is the pushout of an acyclic cofibration, it is
itself an acyclic cofibration. Moreover, since the cohomology
of $\coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}} \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]$
clearly vanishes, it is a quasi-isomorphism.

The map $p$ is manifestly degreewise
onto and hence a fibration.

###### Lemma

Every morphism $f : A \to B$ may be factored as a
cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a  [lemma above](#ProjStructCharAcyclicFibrations) acyclic fibrations
are precisely the maps with the right lifting property against
morphisms in $I = \{0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n], \mathbb{Z}[n]\to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]\}$, which by the [first lemma above](#ProjStructGenCofibs)
are cofibrations.

The claim then follows again from the [[small object argument]]
apllied to $I$.

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

A morphism $f : A \to B$ that is both a cofibration
(:= LLP against acyclic fibrations ) and a weak equivalence
has the left lifting property against all fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a standard argument, this follows from the
factorization lemma proven [above](#ProjStrucFactAxiomI),
which says that we may find a factorization

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{j}{\to}& \hat B
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

with $j$ having LLP against all fibrations and being
a weak equivalence, and $p$ a fibration. Since $f$ is
assumed to be a weak equivalence, it follows that
$p$ is an acyclic fibration. By definition of cofibrations
as $LLP(Fib \cap W)$ this implies that we have the lift in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{j}{\to}& \hat B
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
    &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Equivalently redrawing this as

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& A &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && {}^{\mathllap{p}}
    \downarrow && {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow
    \\
    B &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&
    \hat B
    & \stackrel{p}{\to} &
    B
  }
$$

makes manifest that this exhibts $f$ as a retract of $j$
and as such inherits its left lefting properties.

Taking $\mathcal{P} := ob \mathcal{A}$ to be the class of _all_ objects yields a projective class -- called the _trivial projective class_ . The corresponding morphisms are the class $\mathcal{E}$ of all [[split epimorphism]]s in $\mathcal{A}$.

+-- {: .num_example #PullbackProjectiveClass}
###### Example

Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and $\mathcal{A} = $ $R$-[[Mod]] be the category of $R$-[[module]]s. Choosing $\mathcal{P}$ to be the class of all summands of [[direct sums]] of [[finitely presented]] modules yields a projective class.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Given a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  (F \dashv U) : \mathcal{A} \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}} \mathcal{B}
$$

between [[abelian categories]] and given $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{E})$ a projective class in $\mathcal{B}$ then its **pullback projective class** $(U * \mathcal{P}, U^* \mathcal{E})$ along $U$ on $\mathcal{A}$ is defined by

* $U^* \mathcal{P} := \{retracts\;of\; F P | P \in \mathcal{P}\}$


=--

+-- {: .num_theorem #ModelStructureOnUnboundedFromProjectiveClass}
###### Definition/Theorem

Given a projective class $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{ProjectiveClass}), call a morphism $f \in Ch(\mathcal{A})$

* a fibration if $\mathcal{A}(P,f)$ is a surjection in [[Ab]] for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$;

* a weak equivalence if $\mathcal{A}(P,f)$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] in $Ch(Ab)$
  for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$.

Then this constitutes a [[model category]] structure precisely if cofibrant [[resolution]]s exist, which is the case in particular if

1. $\mathcal{P}$ is the pullback projective class (def. \ref{PullbackProjectiveClass}) of a trivial projective class (def. \ref{TrivialProjectiveClass}) along a functor $U$ that preserves countable [[direct sums]];

1. (...)

When the structure exists, it is a [[proper model category]].


=--

This is theorem 2.2 in [Christensen-Hovey](#ChristensenHovey).

We shall write $Ch(\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{P}}$ for this model category structure.

#### Examples
 {#ExamplesOfStructuresOnUnboundedComplexes}

We list some examples for the model structures on chain complexes in unbounded degree discussed [above](#InUnboundedDegreeGeneralResults).

Let $R$ be an associative ring and $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]].

* [Categorical projective class structure](#CategoricalProjectiveClass)

* [Pure projective class structure](#PureProjectiveClass)


##### Categorical projective class structure
 {#CategoricalProjectiveClass}

+-- {: .num_example #CategoricalProjectiveClasses}
###### Example

The **categorical projective class** on $\mathcal{A}$ is the projective class (def. \ref{ProjectiveClass}) with $\mathcal{P}$ the class of [[direct sum]]mands of free modules. The $\mathcal{P}$-model structure on $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ has

* as fibrations the degreewise surjections.

So this reproduces the standard projective model structure from prop. \ref{ProjModelStructureOnUnbounded}.

=--

##### Pure projective class structure
 {#PureProjectiveClass}

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example


The **pure projective class** on $\mathcal{A}$ has as $\mathcal{P}$ summands of sums of finitely presented modules. Fibrations in the corresponding model structure are the maps that are degreewise those epimorphisms that appear in $\mathcal{P}$-exact sequences.

=--

#### Gillespie's approach using cotorsion pairs

[Hovey](#HoveyOverview) has shown that, roughly speaking, [[model structures]] on [[abelian categories]] correspond to cotorsion pairs.  See [[abelian model structure]].

[Gillespie](#HoveyOverview) shows that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[Grothendieck abelian category]], then a [[cotorsion pair]] induces an [[abelian model structure]] on the category of (unbounded) complexes $Ch(\mathcal{A})$, where the [[weak equivalences]] are [[quasi-isomorphisms]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[Grothendieck abelian category]].  Suppose $(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{E})$ is a hereditary [[cotorsion pair]] that is cogenerated by a set, such that $\mathcal{D}$ is a [[Kaplansky class]] on $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ has enough $\mathcal{D}$-objects.

Then there is an [[abelian model structure]] on the category of complexes $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ such that the trivial objects are the acyclic complexes.
=--

Gillespie uses this result to get a **[[monoidal model category|monoidal]]** [[model structure]] on $Ch(Qcoh(X))$, the category of complexes of [[quasi-coherent sheaves]] on a [[quasi-compact scheme|quasi-compact]] [[separated scheme|separated]] [[scheme]] $X$.  This gives a better understanding of the [[derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves]] $D(Qcoh(X))$, and in particular gives immediately the [[derived functor]] $\cdot \otimes^{\mathbf{L}} \cdot$ (which is usually a problem due to sheaves not having enough projectives).

#### Cisinski-Deglise approach using descent structures

A third approach is due to [Cisinski-Deglise](#CisinskiDeglise).

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[Grothendieck abelian category]].  We will define a notion of **descent structures** on $\mathcal{A}$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
For each object $E$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and integer $n \in \mathbf{Z}$, we define the complexes $S^n E$ and $D^n E$ as follows: let $(S^n E)^n = E$ in degree $n$ and 0 elsewhere; and let $(D^n E)^n = (D^n E)^{n+1} = E$ and 0 elsewhere.  There are canonical morphisms $S^{n+1} E \hookrightarrow D^n E$.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be an essentially small set of objects of $\mathcal{A}$.  A morphism in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ is called a **$\mathcal{G}$-cofibration** if it is contained in the smallest class of morphisms in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ that is closed under [[pushouts]], [[transfinite compositions]] and [[retracts]], generated by the inclusions $S^{n+1} E \to D^n E$, for any integer $n$ and any $E \in \mathcal{G}$.  A complex $C$ in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ is called **$\mathcal{G}$-cofibrant** if the morphism $0 \to C$ is a $\mathcal{G}$-cofibration.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A [[chain complex]] $C$ in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ is called **$\mathcal{G}$-local** if for all $E \in \mathcal{G}$ and $n \in \mathbf{Z}$, the canonical morphism
$$ Hom_{\mathbf{K}(\mathcal{A})}(E[n], C) \to Hom_{\mathbf{D}(\mathcal{A})}(E[n], C) $$
is an isomorphism.  Here $\mathbf{K}(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathbf{D}(\mathcal{A})$ denote the [[homotopy category of complexes]] and the [[derived category]] of $\mathcal{A}$, respectively.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a small family of complexes in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$.  An complex $C$ in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ is called **$\mathcal{H}$-flasque** if for all $n \in \mathbf{Z}$ and $H \in \mathcal{H}$,
$$ Hom_{\mathbf{K}(\mathcal{A})}(H, C[n]) = 0. $$
=--

Finally we define:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A **descent structure** on $\mathcal{A}$ is a pair $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is an essentially small set of generators of $\mathcal{A}$, and $\mathcal{H}$ is an essentially small set of $\mathcal{G}$-cofibrant acyclic complexes such that any $\mathcal{H}$-flasque complex is $\mathcal{G}$-local.
=--

Now one defines a [[model structure]] associated to any such descent structure.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{H})$ be a descent structure on the [[Grothendieck abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$.  There is a [[proper model category|proper]] [[cellular model category|cellular]] [[model structure]] on the category $Ch(\mathcal{A})$, where the [[weak equivalences]] are [[quasi-isomorphisms]] of [[complexes]], and [[cofibrations]] are $\mathcal{G}$-cofibrations.

Also, a complex $C$ in $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ is [[fibrant]] if and only if it is $\mathcal{H}$-flasque or equivalently $\mathcal{G}$-local.
=--

We call this the **$\mathcal{G}$-model structure** on $Ch(\mathcal{A})$.  As in Gillespie's approach we can sometimes get a [[monoidal model structure]].  We refer to [Cisinski-Deglise](#CisinskiDeglise) for the notion of a **weakly flat** descent structure.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Suppose $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{H})$ is a _weakly flat_ descent structure on $\mathcal{A}$.  Then the $\mathcal{G}$-model structure is further [[monoidal model category|monoidal]].

## Properties

### Properness
 {#Properness}

Model categories of chain complexes tend to be [[proper model categories]].

\begin{prop}\label{PushoutAlongDegreewiseInjectionsPreservesQuasiIosmorphism}
**([[pushout]] along degreewise [[injections]] presrves [[quasi-isomorphism]])** \linebreak
  Let 
  $$
   \array{
    A &\overset{\; i \;}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}
    \big\downarrow
    &{}^{{}_{(po)}}&
    \big\downarrow {}^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    C &\underset{\; j \;}{\longrightarrow}& D
   }
  $$
  be a [[pushout]] [[commuting diagram|square]] of [[chain maps]] between (unbounded) [[chain complexes]], such that 

* $i$ is a degreewise [[injection]];

* $f$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

Then also $g$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

[[formal duality|Dually]], the [[pullback]] of a quasi-isomorphism along a degreewise [[surjection]] is again a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{prop}
(e.g. [Strickland 2020, Prop. 24](#Strickland20))
\begin{proof}
  The [[pushout]] of chain complexes is degreewise a pushout in the underlying [[abelian category]].
  Since pushout in abelian categories preserves monomorphisms ([this Prop.](abelian+category#PullbackPreservesEpimorphisms)) it follows that also $j_n$ is a monomorphism. Finally, the [[pasting law]] implies that the induced morphism of [[cokernels]] of $i$ and $j$ is an [[isomorphism]]. In summary, this means that we have a [[commuting diagram]] of chain complexes as follows:
  $$
   \array{
    A
    &\overset{\;\;\; i \;\;\;}{\hookrightarrow}& 
    B 
    &\longrightarrow&
    cok(i)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}
    \big\downarrow
    &{}^{{}_{(po)}}&
    \big\downarrow {}^{\mathrlap{g}}
    &&
    \big\downarrow {}^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    C
    &\underset{\;\;\; j \;\;\;}{\hookrightarrow}& 
    D
    &\longrightarrow&
    cok(j)
    \,.
   }
  $$

This implies a morphism of the corresponding [[long exact sequences in chain homology]] of the form:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots
    &\to&
    H_{n+1}
    \big(
      cok(i)
    \big)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\; \delta \;}
    &
    H_n(A)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\; i_\ast\;}
    &
    H_n(B)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\;\;\;}
    &
    H_n\big(cok(i)\big)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\;\delta\;}
    &
    H_{n-1}(A)
    &
    \to
    &
    \cdots  
    \\
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{}}
    \big\downarrow
    {}^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{f_\ast}}
    \big\downarrow
    {}^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{g_\ast}}
    \big\downarrow
    &&
    \big\downarrow
    {}^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{f_\ast}}
    \big\downarrow
    {}^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \cdots
    &\to&
    H_{n+1}
    \big(
      cok(j)
    \big)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\; \delta \;}
    &
    H_n(C)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\; j_\ast\;}
    &
    H_n(D)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\;\;\;}
    &
    H_n\big(cok(j)\big)
    &
    \xrightarrow{\;\delta\;}
    &
    H_{n-1}(C)
    &
    \to
    &
    \cdots  
  }
$$
From this the [[five lemma]] implies that $g_\ast$ is an isomorphism on [[chain homology]], hence that $g$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{proof}


### Left/right exact functors and Quillen adjunctions {#ExactFuncsAndQuillenFuncs}

Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be [[abelian categories]]. Let the [[categories of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet^+(\mathcal{A})$ and $Ch_\bullet^+(\mathcal{B})$ be equipped with the model structure described [above](#GeneralResults) where fibrations are the degreewise [[split monomorphism]]s with [[injective object|injective]] [[kernel]]s.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If

$$
  (L \dashv R) : \mathcal{A} \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} \mathcal{B}
$$

is a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s where $L$ preserves [[monomorphism]]s, then

$$
  (Ch_\bullet^+(L)
    \dashv
   Ch_\bullet(R) : Ch_\bullet^+(\mathcal{A})
   \stackrel{\overset{Ch_\bullet^+(L)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Ch_\bullet(R)}{\to}}
   Ch_\bullet^+(\mathcal{B})
$$

is a [[Quillen adjunction]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Every functor preserves split epimorphism. Being a [[right adjoint]] in particular $R$ is a [[left exact functor]] and hence preserves kernels. Using the characterization of [[injective object]]s as those $I$ for which $Hom(-,I)$ sends monomorphisms to epimorphisms, we have that $R$ preserves injectives because $L$ preserves monomorphisms, by the adjunction isomorphism.

Hence $L$ preserves all cofibrations and $R$ all fibrations.

=--

### Cofibrant generation

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The injective model structure on $Ch^{\geq 0}(R Mod)$ (from theorem \ref{InjectiveModelStructure}) is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]].

=--

This appears for instance as [Hovey, theorem 2.3.13](#Hovey), where it is stated for unbounded (in both directions) chain complexes.

For results on model structures on chain complexes that are provably not cofibrantly generated see section 5.4 of [Christensen, Hovey](#ChristensenHovey).



### Inclusion into simplicial objects

Let $\mathcal{A} = $ [[Ab]] be the category of [[abelian group]]s. The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] provides a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  (N \dashv \Gamma) : Ch_\bullet^+ \stackrel{\overset{N}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  sAb
$$

between the projective model structure on connective chain complexes and the [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras|model structure on simplicial abelian groups]]. This in turns sits as a [[transferred model structure]] along the [[forgetful functor]] over the [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

$$
  (F \dashv U) : sAb \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}}
  sSet
  \,.
$$

The combined Quillen adjunction

$$
  (N F  \dashv U \Gamma) : Ch_\bullet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} sSet
$$

prolongs to a Quillen adjunction on the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on any [[site]] $C$ , which we denote by the same symbols

$$
  (N F  \dashv U \Gamma) : [C,Ch_\bullet]_{proj} \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} [C, sSet]_{proj}
  \,.
$$

With due care this descends to the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]] which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] on $C$. Then the above Quillen adjunction serves to embed [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] on $C$ into the larger context of [[nonabelian cohomology]] on $C$. See [[cohomology]] for more on this.

### Cofibrations

We discuss cofibrations in the [model structures on unbounded complexes](#OnUnbounded).

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a given projective class on an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$, def. \ref{ProjectiveClass} and write $Ch(\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{P}}$ for the corresponding model structure on unbounded chain complexes, theorem \ref{ModelStructureOnUnboundedFromProjectiveClass}.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

An object $C \in Ch(\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{P}}$ is cofibrant precisely if

1. in each degree $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ the object $C_n$ is relatively projective in $\mathcal{A}$;

1. every morphism from $C$ into a weakly  contractible complex in $Ch(\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{P}}$ is [[chain homotopy|chain homotopic]] to the [[zero morphism]].

=--

This appears as ([ChristensenHovey, lemma 2.4](#ChristensenHovey)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : A \to B$ in $Ch(\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{P}}$ is a cofibration precisely if it is degreewise

1. a [[split monomorphism]];

1. with cofibrant [[cokernel]].

=--

This appears as ([ChristensenHovey, prop. 2.5](#ChristensenHovey)).

### Relation to module spectra

For $R$ any ring, there is the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H R$. This is an [[algebra spectrum]], hence there is a notion of $H R$-[[module spectra]]. These are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to chain complexes of $R$-modules. See [[module spectrum]] for details.

The article

* [[Dan Christensen]], [[Mark Hovey]], _Quillen model structures for relative homological algebra_ ([pdf](http://jdc.math.uwo.ca/papers/relative.pdf))
{#ChristensenHovey}

discusses model structures on unbounded chain complexes with generalized notions of epimorphisms induced from "projective classes".
