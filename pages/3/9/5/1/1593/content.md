An _orientifold_ is a background for [[string theory|string]] [[sigma-model]] that combines aspects of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[orbifold]]s with _orientation reversal_ on the worldsheet (therefore the name): it consists of a [[bundle gerbe]] on a space with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that satisfies a peculiar twisted equvariance condition with respect to this action.

Such orientifold gerbes with connection are the right structure for the definition of surface holonomy of _unoriented_ surfaces. Therefore they serve for defining the gauge part of the [[path integral|action functional]] for unoriented [[string theory|strings]].

One formalization of orientifold backgrounds appeared in

* [[Urs Schreiber]], Christoph Schweigert, [[Konrad Waldorf]], _Unoriented WZW models and Holonomy of Bundle Gerbes_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0512283))

* Krzysztof Gawedzki, Rafal R. Suszek,  [[Konrad Waldorf]], _Bundle Gerbes for Orientifold Sigma Models_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.5125))


A formalization that also takes the spinorial degrees of freedom into account is in

A formulation in [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential nonabelian cohomology]] is indicated in
