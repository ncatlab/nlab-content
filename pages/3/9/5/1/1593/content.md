## Idea

An _orientifold_ is a background for [[string theory|string]] [[sigma-model]]s that combines aspects of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[orbifold]]s with _orientation reversal_ on the worldsheet (therefore the name): it consists of a [[bundle gerbe]] on a space with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that satisfies a peculiar twisted equvariance condition with respect to this action.

Such orientifold gerbes with connection are the right structure for the definition of surface holonomy of _unoriented_ surfaces. Therefore they serve for defining the gauge part of the [[path integral|action functional]] for unoriented [[string theory|strings]].

More precisely, the [[gauge field]]s that constiture the background for a string $\sigma$-model, such as the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[RR-field]]s are modeled as [[cocycle]]s in the [[differential cohomology]] of the target space, and an _orientifold_ is the data given by an [[orbifold]] [[spacetime]] that involves the [[group]] $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and equipped with certain [classes in its( [[twisted cohomology|twisted]]) [[differential cohomology]] that is suitably $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]].
