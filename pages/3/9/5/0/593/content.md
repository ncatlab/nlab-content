I am currently a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
I am fairly new to higher category theory,
but I am fascinated by it.
As there is nobody else at Santa Cruz interested in category
theory, I am hoping to be somewhere next year that has
more activity in this area.

I am currently working through [[Tom Leinster]]'s book
"Higher Operads, Higher Categories".
As there is nobody in Santa Cruz to talk with about this
material, I think adding to the nLab on concepts from
this book would help me digest it.
I'm excited to be a part of this project,
and I hope to expand the subjects of my contributions
in the future.
