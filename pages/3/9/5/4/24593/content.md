# Higher-level foundations

## Definition

By **higher-level foundations**, or simply **higher foundations**, we mean any [[foundation of mathematics]] in which there are, or at least can be, basic objects of [[h-level]] higher than [[h-sets]].  Thus, these objects behave like [[groupoids]] or [[infinity-groupoids]] (or even [[categories]] or [[infinity-categories]]).  This is in contrast to [[set-level foundations]] such as [[set theory]] and [[set-level type theory]] in which all objects behave like sets.

Some higher-level foundations include:

* [[homotopy type theory]] / [[univalent foundations]] of all sorts:
  * [[Book HoTT]]
  * [[cubical type theory]], including CCHM cubical type theory, Cubical Agda, and Cartesian cubical type theory
  * [[higher observational type theory]]
* More generally, [[intensional type theory]], in which no types of higher h-level can be shown to exist, but neither can all types be shown to be [[h-sets]].
* [[formal category theory]]
* [[synthetic (infinity,1)-category theory]], such as [[simplicial type theory]] and bicubical type theory
* Hypothetical elementary theories of the [[bicategory]] of [[categories]] and the [[(2,1)-category]] of [[groupoids]], expressed in [[first-order logic]] with dependent sorts in the same way that [[ETCS]] is.  One extant theory along these lines is [[ETCC]], although it hasn't been successfully made into a full [[foundation of mathematics]].
