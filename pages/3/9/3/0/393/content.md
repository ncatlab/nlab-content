\section{Idea}

A _homotopical category_ is a structure used in [[homotopy theory]], related to but more flexible than a [[model category]].

\section{Definition}

A _homotopical category_ is a category with a distinguished class of
morphisms (called 'weak equivalences') satisfying the following
conditions:

* Every identity map is a weak equivalence.

* It has the **[[2-out-of-6-property]]**: 
if morphisms $h \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ are weak equivalences, then so are $f$, $g$, $h$ and $h \circ g \circ f$.

\section{Remarks}

* If the first condition in Def. 2 holds, then the 2-out-of-6-property implies the [[2-out-of-3]] property, hence every homotopical category is a [[category with weak equivalences]].

* Every [[model category]] yields a homotopical category.

* A functor $F : C \to D$ between homotopical categories which preserves weak equivalences is a [[homotopical functor]].

\section{Simplicial localization}

Every homotopical category $C$ "presents" or "models" an [[(infinity,1)-category]] $L C$, a [[simplicially enriched category]] called the [[simplicial localization]] of $C$, which is in some sense the universal solution to inverting the weak equivalence up to [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] morphisms.
