A _homotopical category_ is a [[category with weak equivalences]] where on top of the 2-out-of-3-property the morphisms satisfy the 

**2-out-of-6-property**: 

If morphisms $h \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ are weak equivalences, then so are $f$, $g$, $h$ and $h \circ g \circ f$.

#Remarks#

* The 2-out-of-6-property implies the 2-out-of-3-property.
