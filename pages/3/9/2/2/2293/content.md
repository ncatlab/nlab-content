The term __derived algebraic geometry__ is used in two closely related but logically different notions: as the part of the geometry of schemes captured cohomologically (by the derived category of coherent sheaves) what presents the kind of data very close to the interests of classical Italian school and as the derived moduli spaces, which extend or replace the usual moduli spaces. In the early works of Russian school (Kapranov, Bondal, Orlov, [[Kontsevich]]) it meant, replacing a variety by the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] (or [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on that variety, or dg-category ($A_\infty$-category) [[enhanced triangulated category|enhancements]] thereof. There are also noncommutative deformations of such derived categories and analogues like the categories corresponding to the so-called [[Landau-Ginzburg model]]s. Therefore noncommutative derived geometry (and even noncommutative motives). Derived category does NOT remember all the structure of the original variety hence the derived geometry looses often some information (sometimes not); thus derived algebraic geometry is sometimes easier than nonderived. On the other hand there is a closely related effort to include sheaves of commutative dg-algebras as structure sheaves (dg-schemes of Kaprabov, Ciocan-Fontaine, and Kontsevich) and more generally to allow higher categorical structured spaces of algebraic type, generalizing algebraic stacks, schemes and algebraic spaces. This [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of [[algebraic geometry]]: its [[vertical categorification]] is also called derived algebraic geometry. Notice that in that sense, there is no loss of information in a passage from a scheme to its natural extension to a derived scheme. This second school has been, after the original ideas of Deligne, Drinfel'd and Kontsevich advanced by [[Carlos Simpson]] (who introduced also basic prerequisited like algebraic and geometric $n$-stacks), and later [[Bertrand Toen]] and coworkers. One of the main motivations for both variants of derived alegbraic geometry is to develop the satisfactory deformation theory and on its basis the theory of moduli stacks in algebraic geometry beyond the few examples which work in classical language of algebraic spaces and algebraic 1-stacks. Sometimes, but not always getting rid of limitations coming from 1-categorical truncations removes nonsmoothness, but the expectations in that directions (hidden smoothness principle) failed in generality expected at the beginning. The construction of the derived moduli spaces relies, similarly to the classical moduli theory in algebraic geometry, on the infinitesimal case -- the [[deformation theory]] (cf. [[cotangent complex]]).

## "derived" in the second sense versus "$\infty$-"

The adjective "derived" means pretty much the same as the "$\infty$-" in [[∞-category]]. It stems from the use of "derived" as in [[derived category]] and [[derived functor]]. But incidentally, derived algebraic geometry is honestly [[higher category theory|higher catgeorical]], whereas derived categories and derived functors are really more like 1-categorical shadows of higher categorical structures, as described in detail at [[homotopy category]].

There is no really systematic rule to the use of the word "derived" here. For instance [[derived stack]] has become the standard term for the general version of the notion of [[∞-stack]], but [[Higher Topos Theory]] is not called "derived topos theory".

> [[Urs Schreiber]]: personally I'd think that "derived algebraic geometry" is therefore a misnomer. But who am I to stop that train? :-)
 
## relation to higher algebra ##

Where ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] uses [[algebra]] to describe [[geometry]], derived algebraic geometry uses [[higher algebra]]. Where ordinary algebraic geometry uses [[scheme]]s modeled on [[commutative ring]]s, derived algebraic geometry uses [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es modeled on [[E-∞ ring]]s .


# Examples #

##Homological mirror symmetry##

Homological mirror symmetry is one of the main motivations and statements of the derived algebraic geometry of the first kind.

## elliptic cohomology ##

More recent big success of derived algebraic geometry of the second kind was [[elliptic cohomology]] and the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]] as a certain derived moduli  "of derived elliptic curves". This construction of moduli space is based on earlier Lurie result (not available in full) in which Lurie has proved an analogue of the Artin's representability theorem from the algebraic geometry of Grothendieck school. For more on that see

The theory of derived algebraic geometry in the second sense is given yet another general framework in 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[structured (∞,1)-topos|Structured Spaces]] 

which merges the structural theory developed in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]


with the theory developed in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Noncommutative algebra_, _Commutative algebra_ (see [[higher algebra]]).

This formal aspect is supposedly related to the infinitesimal picture of the moduli stacks considered by Toen et al. and it generalizes more classical approaches to the deformation theory like Illusie's cotangent complex (cf. also smooth obstruction theory of Fantechi-Behrend).
