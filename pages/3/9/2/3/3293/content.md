## Idea

In analogy to how a [[Diff|smooth manifold]] is a [[manifold]] modeled on a space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [[CartSp]], a _Fr&#233;chet manifold_ is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[Fréchet space]].


## Examples

Standard examples of Fr&#233;chet manifolds are smooth mapping spaces such as the

* [[smooth loop space]].
