## Idea

In analogy to how a [[smooth manifold]] is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [[CartSp]], a _Fr&#233;chet manifold_ is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[Fr√©chet space]].


## Examples

Standard examples of Fr&#233;chet manifolds are smooth mapping spaces such as the

* [[smooth loop space]].
