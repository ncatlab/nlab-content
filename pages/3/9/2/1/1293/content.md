[Greg Egan](http://www.gregegan.net) is an Australian science fiction author, with several articles in the journal _Classical and Quantum Gravity_ to his name. His writing is very 'hard', in the sense that it contains lots of scientific and mathematical detail. Egan contributes images to [[John Baez]]'s blog [Visual Insight](http://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/).

Along with [[J. Daniel Christensen]], Greg Egan presented an algorithm, written in C++, to understand the asymptotic behavior of the [[10j symbol]], a [[spin network]] that arises in the [[partition function]] for the [[Barrett-Crane model]] of 4d [[Euclidean field theory|Riemannian]] [[quantum gravity]]. This partition function is the summation over all spin labelings of the faces in the dual [[simplicial skeleton|2-skeleton]] of a fixed [[triangulation]] of spacetime, applied to an expression which contains the product of a [[10j symbol]] for each dual vertex.
