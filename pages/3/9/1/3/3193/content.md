For an operator among [[Banach spaces]], being compact is a natural strengthening of the continuity (boundedness). A linear operator is **compact** if it sends the bounded subsets to [[relatively compact subset|relatively compact subsets]]. 
In particular every compact operator is bounded. Instead of checking compactness on all bounded subsets it is sufficient to check it for a ball of one fixed radius: an operator is compact iff it sends the ball of unit radius to a relatively compact set.

In the setup of [[Hilbert spaces]], instead of a compact operator, one sometimes says, a completely continuous operator. In fact, in the full generality of Banach spaces, by a **completely continuous operator** one means slightly less: it maps every weakly convergent sequence to a norm convergent sequence. Thus for Hilbert spaces and, more generally, for reflexive Banach spaces the two notions are equivalent.
