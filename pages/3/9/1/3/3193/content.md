## Idea

For a [[linear operator]] between [[Banach spaces]], compactness is a natural strengthening of [[bounded operator|continuity]] (boundedness). 


## Definition

A [[linear operator]] is **compact** if it sends [[bounded subspace|bounded subsets]] to [[relatively compact subset|relatively compact subsets]]. 

\begin{remark}
For linear operators on [[Hilbert spaces]], instead of *compact operators* one sometimes speaks of *completely continuous operators*. However, in the full generality of [[Banach spaces]], by a **completely continuous operator** one means slightly less: an operator that maps every [[weak convergence|weakly convergent]] sequence to a [[norm convergence|norm convergent]] sequence. For Hilbert spaces and, more generally, for [[reflexive Banach spaces]], the two notions are equivalent.
\end{remark}


## Properties

Since every relatively compact subspace (in a Banach space, or indeed in any [[metric space]]) is bounded, every compact operator is bounded. Instead of checking compactness on all bounded subsets it is sufficient to check it for a [[ball]] of one fixed radius: an operator is compact iff it sends the ball of unit radius to a relatively compact set.

The [[quotient]] of the [[bounded operators]] by the compact operators is called the _[[Calkin algebra]]_.
