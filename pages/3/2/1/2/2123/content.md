In [[algebra]], the term '**ring theory**' usually refers to the study of classical (not necessarily commutative) [[rings]], unital or not, and often also of [[modules]] over them. 

Some of the related entries in nlab include [[noetherian ring]], [[maximal spectrum]], [[prime spectrum]], [[commutative algebra]], [[prime ideal]], [[ideal]], [[filter]], [[Ore set]], [[Gabriel filter]], [[primitive ideal]], [[Schur's lemma]]. 

Generalizations of rings include [[rigs]], $\Omega$-[[Omega-group|groups]], [[generalized rings]] in the sense of Durov, [[associative algebra|associative algebras]] over a commutative ring; moreover [[additive categories]] can be considered as a [[horizontal categorification]] of unital rings; and once upon a time they were called _rings with many objects_.
