## Idea

Broadly speaking, a "hypersurface" is a higher-[[dimension|dimensional]] analogue of a _[[surface]]_. Typically the term is used in generalization of [[curves]] and [[surfaces]] that are [[embedding of topological spaces|embedded]] into an ambient [[Cartesian space]]/[[Euclidean space]] -- such as is the case for _[[iso-hypersurfaces]]_ -- and used in this sense  the notion is essentially synonymous to that of a _[[submanifold]]_.
