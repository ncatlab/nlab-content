## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _group of units_, denoted $R^\times$ or $GL_1(R)$, is the [[group]] whose elements are the elements of $R$ that are invertible under the product, and whose group operation is the multiplication in $R$.

Note that $GL_1(R)$ is an [[affine variety]] (in fact an affine algebraic group) over $R$, namely $\{(x, y) \in R^2: x y = 1\}$. This leads us to the following perspective: in a general category with [[finite limits]], with $R$ a ring object therein, the group of units is correctly defined as the [[equalizer]] of the two maps $m, c_1: R \times R \to R$, where $m$ is the ring multiplication and $c_1$ is the [[constant map]] with value the multiplicative identity. Cf. Example \ref{idele} below.

## Properties

### Relation to the multiplicative group

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The group of units of $R$ is equivalently the collection of [[morphisms]]
from $Spec R$ into the [[group of units]] $\mathbb{G}_m$

$$
  GL_1(R) = R^\times \simeq Hom(Spec R, \mathbb{G}_m)
  \,.
$$

### Relation to the group ring

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (R[-]\dashv (-)^\times)
  \colon 
  Alg_R \stackrel{\overset{R[-]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{(-)^\times}{\to}} Grp
$$

between the [[category]] of [[associative algebras]] over $R$ and that of [[groups]], where $R[-]$ forms the [[group algebra]] over $R$ and where $(-)^\times$ assigns to an $R$-algebra its group of units.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #idele}
###### Example

The group of units of the [[ring of adeles]] $\mathbb{A}$ is the [[group of ideles]]. The topology on the idele group $\mathbb{I}$ arises by considering $\mathbb{I}$ as an affine variety in $\mathbb{A}^2$ as above, and giving it the subspace topology. This is _not_ the subspace topology induced by the inclusion $\mathbb{I} \hookrightarrow\mathbb{A}$ into the ring of adeles.

###### Example 
The group of units of the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ fits in an exact sequence 

$$1 \to 1 + p \mathbb{Z}_p \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p^\times \to (\mathbb{Z}/(p))^\times \to 1$$ 

where the quotient is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/(p-1)$ and the kernel is, at least when $p \gt 2$, isomorphic to the *additive group* $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Explicitly, for such $p$ the formal [[exponential map]] $\exp(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{x^n}{n!}$ converges when $x \in p \mathbb{Z}_p$ and maps $p \mathbb{Z}_p$ isomorphically onto the multiplicative group $1 + p \mathbb{Z}_p$. The formal logarithm $\log(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{(-1)^n (x - 1)^n}{n}$ is also convergent for $x \in 1 + p \mathbb{Z}_p$ and provides the inverse. 

By [[Henselian ring|Hensel's lemma]], the group of units $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ has $(p-1)^{th}$ [[roots of unity]] and therefore the exact sequence above splits. This splitting descends to the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}/(p^n)$ and its group of units, giving an isomorphism $GL_1(\mathbb{Z}/(p^n)) \cong \mathbb{Z}/(p^{n-1}) \oplus \mathbb{Z}/(p-1)$.
