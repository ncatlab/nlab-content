## Idea

* A *functor* is a [[homomorphism]] of [[categories]].

* A functor between [[small categories]] is a [[homomorphism]] of the [[underlying]] [[graphs]] that respects the [[composition]] of [[edges]].

So, for $C$, $D$ two [[categories]], a functor $F \colon C \to D$ consists of 

1. a component-[[function]] of the [[classes]] of [[objects]];

   $F_0 \colon Obj(C) \to Obj(D)$ 

* a component-[[function]] of [[sets]] of [[morphisms]]

  $F_1 \colon Mor(C) \to Mor(D)$ 

  or equivalently: 

  for each [[pair]] $x,y \in Obj(C)$ of [[objects]], a component-[[function]]

  \[
    \label{ComponentFunctionOnHomSets}
    F_{x,y} \;\colon\; C(x,y) \xrightarrow{\;\;} D(F(x), F(y))
  \]

  between [[hom-sets]];

such that:

* it respects [[source]] and [[target]] of [[morphisms]]: $F_1$ coincides with $F_0$ on source and target objects;

* it respects [[identity morphisms]]: $F(id_X) = id_{F(X)}$;

* it respects [[composition]]: the image of the composite of two morphisms under $F$ is the composite of their images.

These last two properties are the decisive ones of a functor; they are called the **functoriality conditions**.  These are a direct generalization of the notion of [[homomorphism]] (of [[monoids]], [[groups]], [[algebras]], etc.) to the case that there are more objects. As a slogan:

The notion of functor is a [[horizontal categorification]] of that of [[homomorphism]].

## Definition

### External definition

A **functor** $F$ from a [[category]] $C$ to a category $D$ is a map sending each [[object]] $x \in C$ to an object $F(x) \in D$ and each [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in $C$ to morphism $F(f) : F(x) \to F(y)$ in $D$, such that

* $F$ preserves [[composition]]: $F(g\circ f) = F(g)\circ F(f)$ whenever the left-hand side is well-defined,

* $F$ preserves [[identity morphisms]]: for each object $x \in C$, $F(1_x) = 1_{F(x)}$.

Or equivalently, since compositions $g f = g\circ f$ (commuting triangles) and identities $1_x$ (commuting loops) are both simple commuting diagrams, we can combine the above conditions to the single statement

* $F$ preserves [[commuting diagrams]].

Given [[morphisms]] $f \colon X\to Y$, $g \colon Y\to Z$, and $h \colon X\to Z$, declaring the triangle commutes amounts to declaring 
$$h = g\circ f.$$ 
In this case, for $F:C\to D$ to preserve the commutative triangle means 
$$F(h) = F(g)\circ F(f)$$
as depicted below

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/functor.jpg" width = "300"/>

Preserving commuting triangles means $F$ preserves compositions. 

Given morphisms $f:X\to Y$, $g:Y\to Z$, and $h:Z\to X$, declaring the loop commutes amounts to declaring 
$$1_X = h\circ g\circ f.$$
In this case, for $F:C\to D$ to preserve the commutative loop means 
$$F(1_X) = F(h)\circ F(g)\circ F(f)$$
as depicted below

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/commuteloop.jpg" width = "300"/>

However, it means more than that. Since any commutative loop is equal to the identity morphism, we must also have
$$1_{F(X)} = F(h)\circ F(g)\circ F(f)$$
implying
$$F(1_X) = 1_{F(X)}.$$

Preserving commuting loops means $F$ preserves identity morphisms.

Another equivalent way to say this is that a functor $F : C \to D$ is precisely a morphism of [[simplicial sets]] $N(F) : N(C) \to N(D)$ between the [[nerves]] of these categories

* the [[objects]] of $C$ and $D$ are the 0-cells of $N(C)$ and $N(D)$, so $N(F)_0 : N(F)_0 \to N(F)_0$ maps objects of $C$ to objects of $D$;

* the [[morphisms]] of $C$ and $D$ are the 1-cells of $N(C)$ and $N(D)$, so $N(F)_1 : N(F)_1 \to N(F)_1$ maps morphisms of $C$ to objects of $D$;

* the identity morphisms of $C$ and $D$ are the degenerate 1-cells of $N(C)$ and $N(D)$, so the fact that $N(F)$ respects degeneracy maps means that $F$ respects identities;

* the commuting triangles of $C$ and $D$ are the 2-cells of $N(C)$ and $N(D)$, so the fact that $N(F)$ maps 2-cells to 2-cells means that it respects commuting triangles, hence that it respects composition.

See [[nerve]] for more details on this.


The functors between two categories $C$ and $D$ form themselves a category, the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$, whose morphisms are [[natural transformations]]. Equipped with these functor categories as [[hom-objects]], we have a $2$-[[2-category|category]] [[Cat]] of categories, functors and natural transformations.  In other words, functors are [[morphisms]] in $Cat$.

### Internal definition {#InternalDefinition}

If $C$ and $D$ are [[internal categories]] in some ambient category $A$, then an __internal functor__ $F : C \to D$ is 

* a morphism of objects $F_0 : C_0 \to D_0$ in $A$;

* a morphisms of morphisms $F_1 : C_1 \to D_1$ in $A$;

* such that the following diagrams commute

  * respect for the source map: 
  $
 \array{
  C_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\to}& D_1
  \\
  \downarrow^s && \downarrow^s
  \\
  C_0 
  &\stackrel{f_0}{\to}&
  D_0
 }
$;

   * respect for the target map: 
  $
 \array{
  C_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\to}& D_1
  \\
  \downarrow^t && \downarrow^t
  \\
  C_0 
  &\stackrel{f_0}{\to}&
  D_0
 }
$;

   * respect for identities 
  $
 \array{
   C_0 &\stackrel{f_0}{\to}&
   D_0
   \\
   \downarrow^i && \downarrow^i
   \\
   C_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\to}& D_1
 }
$;

   * respect for composition 
  $
  \array{
    C_1 \times_{t,s} 
   C_1 &\stackrel{f_1\times_{t,s} f_1}{\to}&
   D_1 \times_{t,s} D_1
  \\
   \downarrow^{\circ} && \downarrow^{\circ}
  \\
  C_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\to}& D_1
  }  
$.

This reproduces the external definition of functors above for [[small categories]], which are categories [[internalization|internal to]] [[Set]]

In many cases, this notion is too restrictive, and we should use internal [[anafunctors]] instead.


### Enriched definition

In [[enriched category theory]] a functor maps not [[hom-sets]] but the given [[hom-objects]] to each other, in a way that respects their composition. This is described at

* [[enriched functor]].


### Profunctors

A generalization of the notion of [[enriched functor]] is the notion of [[profunctor]].

### Higher categorical functors

In [[higher category theory]] there are corresponding higher notions of functor, such as

* [[2-functor]]

  * [[strict 2-functor]]

  * [[pseudofunctor]]

  * [[lax functor]]

* [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]


* See also an informal discussion about an [[experimental alternative definition of functor]].

### In homotopy type theory

Note: the [[HoTT book]] calls a [[category]] a "precategory" and a [[univalent category]] a "category", but here we shall refer to the standard terminology of "category" and "univalent category" respectively. 

The definition of functor in homotopy type theory is a straightforward translation of the ordinary one.  However, the notion of [[univalent category]] allows us to construct some such functors that in classical mathematics would require either the [[axiom of choice]] or the use of [[anafunctors]].

 {#Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ be [[categories]]. Informally, a **functor** $F : A \to B$ consists of

* A function $F_0 : A_0 \to B_0$
* For each $a,b:A$, a function $F_{a,b}:hom_A(a,b) \to hom_B(F a,F b)$, generally also denoted $F$.
* For each $a:A$, we have $F(1_a)=1_{F a}$.
* For each $a,b,c: A$ and $f:hom_A(a,b)$ and $g:hom_A(b,c)$, we have

$$F(g \circ f) = F g \circ F f$$

Formally, the type of functors from $A$ to $B$ is

$$ Func(A,B) \coloneqq
\sum_{F_0:A_0\to B_0} \sum_{F:\prod_{a,b:A} hom_A(a,b) \to \hom_B(F a,F b)} \Big(\prod_{a:A} F(1_a) = 1_{F a}\Big) \times \Big( \prod_{a,b,c:A} \prod_{f:\hom_A(a,b)} \prod_{g:\hom_A(b,c)} F(g \circ f) = F g \circ F f\Big) $$

A formal definition in [[Coq]] can be found in [Ahrens-Kapulkin-Shulman 13](#AhrensKapulkinShulman13).

## Properties

These properties come from the [[HoTT book]]. 

By induction on [[identity]], a functor also preserves $idtoiso$ (See [[category]]).

### Composition of functors ###

For functors $F:A\to B$ and $G:B \to C$, their composite $G \circ F : A \to C$ is given by

* The composite $(G_0 \circ F_0): A_0 \to C_0$
* For each $a,b:A$, the composite
$$(G_{F a, F b} \circ F_{a,b}):hom_A(a,b)\to hom_C(G F a, G F b)$$

### Lemma 9.2.9 in HoTT book###
Composition of functors is associative $H(G F)=(H G)F$.

**Proof:** Since composition of functions is associative, this follows immediately for the actions on objects and on homs. And since hom-sets are sets, the rest of the data is automatic. $\square$

### Lemma 9.2.10 in HoTT book###
Lemma 9.2.9 is coherent, i.e. the following pentagon of equalities commutes:


$$ 
   \array{
     && (K H)(G F)
     \\
     & \nearrow
     &&
     \searrow
     \\
     ((K H) G) F
     && &&
     K (H (G F))
     \\
     \downarrow 
     && && 
     \uparrow
     \\
     (K(H G)) F
     && \longrightarrow &&
     K( (H G) F)
   }
$$

## Types of functors

Specific types of functors are important in applications. See for instance

* [[essentially surjective functor]]

* [[full functor]]

* [[faithful functor]]

* [[full and faithful functor]]

And for more background on this see [[stuff, structure, property]].

##Examples 

### Morphisms of monoids and groups 

For $A,B$ [[monoids]] or $G, H$ [[groups]], let $\mathbf{B}A, \mathbf{B}B$, $\mathbf{B}G$, $\mathbf{B}H$ be the corresponding one-object [[category|categories]] (as described at [[delooping]]). Then functors

$$
  \mathbf{B}A \to \mathbf{B}B
$$

are canonically in bijection with monoid homomorphisms $A \to B$ and accordingly functors

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}H
$$

are canonically in bijection with group homomorphisms $G \to H$.


### Representations 

With $\mathbf{B}G$ as above, functors on $\mathbf{B}G$ with values in [[Vect]] are the same as linear [[representations]] of the [[group]] $G$. In fact, we have a canonical isomorphism of categories

$$
  Funct(\mathbf{B}G, Vect) \simeq Rep(G)
$$

of the [[functor category]] with the representation category.


### Linear Maps

Let $\mathbf{B} End(U)$ and $\mathbf{B} End(V)$ be one-object categories whose objects are each finite-dimensional vector space and whose morphisms are all of the linear [[endomorphisms]] on that space, i.e. one-object [[full subcategory|full subcategories]] of $Fin Vect$.


#### Left Inverses

If the linear map $F:U\to V$ has a left inverse, i.e.

$$F^*\circ F = 1_U,$$

where $F^*$ is the [[preimage]], then we can construct a functor 

$$F_*:\mathbf{B} End(U)\to\mathbf{B} End(V)$$

by defining its action on objects by

$$F_*(U) = F_* U$$

where $F_*$ on the right-hand side is the [[image]] and its action on endomorphisms by

$$F_*(f) = F f F^*.$$

Composition follows immediately

$$F_*(f g) = F f g F^* = F f F^* F g F^* = F_*(f) F_*(g).$$

Identity morphisms are preserved since for any vector $y$ in $F_*U\subset V$, then 

$$y = F x$$

for some vector $x$ in $U$ and we have

$$F_*(1_U)y = F\circ F^* y = F\circ F^*\circ F x = F x = y$$

so that

$$F_*(1_U) = 1_{F_*(U)}$$

as required. Hence, $F_*$ is a functor.


#### Right Inverses

If the linear map $F:U\to V$ has a right inverse, i.e.

$$F\circ F^* = 1_V,$$

where $F^*$ is the preimage, then we can construct a functor 

$$F^*:\mathbf{B} End(V)\to\mathbf{B} End(U)$$

by defining its action on objects by

$$F^*(V) = F^*V$$

where $F^*$ on the right-hand side is preimage, and its action on endomorphisms by

$$F^*(f) = F^* f F.$$

Composition follows immediately

$$F^*(f g) = F^* f g F = F^* f F F^* g F = F^*(f) F^*(g).$$

Identity morphisms are preserved since for any vector $x$ in $F^*V\subset U$, then 

$$x = F^*y$$

for some vector $y$ in $V$ and we have

$$F^*(1_V)x = F^*\circ F x = F^*\circ F \circ F^* y = F^* y = x$$

so that

$$F^*(1_V) = 1_{F^*(V)}$$

as required. Hence, $F^*$ is a functor.


### Presheaves 

Functors $F : C \to Set$ with values in [[Set]] are also called [[presheaf|presheaves]]. As such one calls them presheaves on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ of $C$. See [[presheaf]] for more on this.


### Functors and generalized elements {#OnGeneralizedElements}

For $C$ a [[category]], and $X \in C$ an [[object]], and $U$ any other object, a [[morphism]] $x : U \to X$ may be regarded as a [[generalized element]] of $X$, written $x \in X$ (For this language applied to the category [[Set]] of sets see [[ETCS]]. For the general case see [[type theory]]).

The _[[set]]_ of generalized elements of an object $X \in C$ is thus the union of [[hom-sets]] $\coprod_{U \in C} Hom_C(U,X)$.

While a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in an  arbitrary category $C$ need not at all come to us as a function of sets, it always induces a function of sets of _generalized elements_ : it sends the generalized element $x : U \to X$ of $X$ to the generalized element 

$$
  f(x) : U \stackrel{x}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
$$ 

of $Y$, using the composition of the morphism $f$ with the morphism $x$ in $C$.

In terms of this notation, the functoriality condition on a functor $F : C \to D$, which is 

$$
  F(U \stackrel{x}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y)
  =
  F(U) \stackrel{F(x)}{\to} F(X) \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} F(Y)
$$

appears as

$$
  F(f(x)) = F(f)(F(x))
  \,.
$$

This can be illustrated in the following diagram

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/altfunctor.jpg" width = "300"/>

which provides an alternative expression of the functoriality condition as simply a statement that commuting diagrams in $C$ map to commuting diagrams in $D$.
