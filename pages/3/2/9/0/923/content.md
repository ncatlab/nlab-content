This article is about the twisted tensor product of a dga-algebra and a dg-coalgebra (and generalizations). For another notion of [[twisted tensor product of algebras]] see there. 

##Idea ##

In 1959, [[Edgar Brown]] introduced a _twisted tensor product_ to give an algebraic description of a [[fibration]]. The chain complex of a total space of a principal fibration is obtained as a small perturbation (at the level of a differential) of the [[chain complex]] of the trivial fibration (hence a [[tensor product]] of chain complexes of the base and of the fiber). It is the analogue for differential algebra of the [[twisted cartesian product]] construction in the theory of simplicial fibre bundles.

##Definition##

Let $C$ be a dg-[[coalgebra]], $A$ a [[dg-algebra]], $\tau:C\to A$ the [[twisting cochain]], $L$ a right $C$-dg-co[[module]] with co[[action]] $\delta_L:L \to L\otimes C$ and $M$ a left $A$-dg-module with action $m_M:M\otimes A\to A$. The __twisted tensor product__ $L\otimes_\tau M$ is the chain complex that coincides with the ordinary tensor product $L\otimes M$ as a [[graded vector space|graded module]] over the [[ground ring]], and whose differential $d_\tau$ is given by 
$$
d_\tau = d_L\otimes 1 + 1\otimes d_M + (1\otimes m_M)\circ(1\otimes\tau\otimes 1)\circ(\delta_L\otimes 1).
