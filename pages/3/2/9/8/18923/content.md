## Idea
A surreal space is essentially the space of [[surreal numbers]]; it can be seen as a [[vector space]] over any given surreal number [[field]].  The arithmetic properties of the surreals of course follow suit in this space. We denote the surreal space as $\mathbf{S}^n$. Any given real vector space $\mathbb{R}^m$ is by default a [[subspace]]. In a sense, $\mathbf{S}^n$ is a [[module]] over a field of [[real numbers]]. 

### Summary


## Construction

Given $\mathbf{S}^n$ $\supset$ $\mathbb{R}^m$ there exists the category of modules in the former that distribute over the latter. We write ${SMod}$ for it.

###### Definition

${SMod}$ is a module over an enriched category. 

###### In Detail
From the definition of vector spaces we have 
$$
  Vect_S \coloneqq SMod
  \,.$$
$$SMod \supset \mathbb{R}Mod$$
The surreal numbers naturally are an enriched category over the reals given that the elements of the category ${Sur}$ are elements of [[Hom]] contained within ${Real}$.

The category of real modules is a subcategory of the category of surreal modules. 

Surreal space (denoted as $\mathbf{S}^n$) can be seen as a [[topologically enriched category]] of a real space $\mathbb{R}^m$. We write ${Sur}$ to denote it. Its objects are all the infinitely near points of $\mathbb{R}^m$, and all vector spaces over ordered fields. In fact, ${Sur}$ is a vector space over the reals. It is an equivalence relation acting on the reals and forms enriched modules over them. Given the concept of a topological space blended with this notion we thus have a ringed space. Kruskal demonstrated that the surreals describe the asymptotic behavior of the reals. From this we can see this as part of the objects in ${Sur}$. 

###Surreal space as a projective space
####1. Every surreal line is a projective line.
Every [[ordered field]] can be hypothetically embedded within the surreals. Now given this, we can say that for a drawn line of surreal numbers we have that it is in a sense a [[projective line]]. More specifically, if say you have the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ microscopically embedded within $\mathbf{S}^n$ and given a disjoint union of $\mathbb{R}$ and $(\infty)$, the latter of which is contained within the surreals as they contain the infinite numbers, we have a one-point compactification for any given union for a subfield of reals and a collection of infinite numbers. This makes every surreal line a special kind of projective line. This connection leads us to seeing that the asymptotic collection of real-valued functions is contained within $obj({Sur})$ 

###Infinitely blown up space

## Genetic spaces, schemes, and surreal curves
In [Salzedo] it is from here we can define polynomials over surreal spaces. Zeroes of polynomials over these surreal polynomials is analogous to projective schemes in a real space. A genetic space is a space in which [[ringed spaces]] can be related with genetic formulas. The surreal curve is defined as a surreal space of dimension one. Genetic spaces are essentially real algebraic cycles of schemes. 

## Vector Bundles as elements of surreal space

### Genetic transformations

## Motivic surreal spaces
The [[sheaf cohomology]] on a surreal space is equivalent to a [[motivic cohomology]] of real algebraic cycles. ${Sur}$ contains real motives. 

## Quasi-categorical framework
Certain tools can be used to show the quasi-categorical format of surreal spaces. A surreal space is a topos over the reals.
