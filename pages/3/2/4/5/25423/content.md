__Maslov-Feynman calculus__ (Feynman-Maslov commutator expansion) is an expansion in terms of commutators of expressions in associative algebras. It has been pioneered independently by [[Richard Feynman]] in quantum field theory and by [[V. P. Maslov]] in the analysis of operators (and, in particular, WKB method).

Kapranov used it in "[[Kapranov's noncommutative geometry]] based on commutator expansions".
