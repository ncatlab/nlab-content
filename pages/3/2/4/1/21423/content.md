## Idea

The idea of [[Kaluza-Klein theory]] has traditionally been applied mostly to "[[color charge|color physics]]", such as in attempts to realize the [[color charges]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] ([[quarks]] and [[gluons]]) as a Kaluza-Klein compactification of [[heterotic supergravity]] (see for instance at _[[string phenomenology]] -- [heterotic models](string+phenomenology#ReferencesHeteroticModels)_). The success of this approach remains somewhat elusive (see also at _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_).

Alternatively, Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered for "[[flavor physics]]" to produce the charges of [[flavor physics|flavor]]-"[[hidden local symmetries]]", namely the [[baryons]] and [[mesons]], respectively, hence the [[hadrons]] of [[quantum hadrodynamics]]. In terms of [[geometric engineering of QFT]] via [[intersecting D-brane models]] this means to consider [[gauge theory]] on _[[flavor branes]]_ (instead of on _[[color branes]]_), such as in the [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] of [[holographic QCD]].

| | [[color charge]] | [[flavor physics|flavor charge]] |
|----|----|-----|
| **[[gauge bosons]]** | [[gluons]] <br/>  ([[gauge group]]-[[local symmetry]])  | [[mesons]] <br/> ([[flavor physics|flavor]]-[[hidden local symmetry]]) |
| **[[fermions]]** | [[quarks]] | [[baryons]] |

Indeed, the [[experiment|experimentally]] observed [[mesons]] appear in towers of increasing mass ("higher resonances"), which may usefully be identified as a Kaluza-Klein tower of the single [[gauge boson]] of an [[SU(2)]]-[[D=5 Yang-Mills theory]] ([Son-Stephanov 03](#SonStephanov03)). 

Moreover, the [[pion field]] appears as the gauge 0-mode of this tower, right away in its [[soliton|solitonic]] incarnation as the [[Skyrmion]]-excitation in 4d, hence reflecting [[baryons]]. (This phenomenon is secretly the old theorem of [Atiyah-Manton 89](#AtiyahManton89), as explained from the modern perspective of [[holographic QCD]] in [Sutcliffe 10](#Sutcliffe10), [Sutcliffe 15](#Sutcliffe15)).

Various qualitative phenomena of the [[phenomenology]] of [[quantum hadrodynamics]] find a natural explanation in hadron Kaluza-Klein theory this way, notably:

1. [[hidden local symmetry]] itself (by the very KK-reduction of a gauge theory)

1. [[vector meson dominance]] (as discussed there)

1. QCD sum rules (...)

1. (...)

In terms of [[string phenomenology]], the [[flavor brane]]-[[D=5 Yang-Mills theory]] which gives [[quantum hadrodynamics]] this way naturally arises on [[D4/D8-brane intersections]] in the [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05](#SakaiSugimoto05)) or else on [[M5-branes]] [[wrapped brane|wrapped]] on a [[closed interval]] ([Ivanova-Lechtenfeld-Popov 18](#IvanovaLechtenfeldPopov18))

Already to first approximation, this produces for instance [[baryon]] [[mass]] spectra with moderate quantitative agreement with [[experiment]] ([HSSY 07](#HSSY07)):

An extensive review of hadron Kaluza-Klein theory may be found in [Rho et al 16](#RhoEtAl16).

Strikingly, the [[experiment|experimentally]] observed [[hadron]]-spectrum also exhibits [[supersymmetry]]: see at _[[hadron supersymmetry]]_.

### History

The late [[Michael Atiyah]], following up on his visionary early work in [Atiyah-Manton 89](#AtiyahManton89), saw the relevance of further develop [[hadron Kaluza-Klein theory]], and suggested using advanced tools of [[complex geometry]] for this purpose; for a reminiscence see

* [[Bernd Schroers]], p. 2-3 of:  _Michael Atiyah and Physics: the Later Years_,  ([arXiv:1910.10630](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10630)) in: Notices of the AMS, _Memories of Sir Michael Atiyah_ ([pdf](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201911/rnoti-p1834.pdf))

This led to a sequence of visionary but speculative articles, including the following:

* [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Nicholas Manton]], [[Bernd Schroers]], _Geometric Models of Matter_, Proceedings of the Royal Society A  ([arXiv:1108.5151](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5151), [doi:10.1098/rspa.2011.0616](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2011.0616))

* [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Nicholas Manton]], _Complex Geometry of Nuclei and Atoms_,  International Journal of Modern Physics AVol. 33, No. 24, 1830022 (2018) ([arXiv:1609.02816](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02816), [doi:10.1142/S0217751X18300223](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X18300223))

* [[Michael Atiyah]], _Geometric Models of Helium_,  Modern Physics Letters AVol. 32, No. 14, 1750079 (2017) ([arXiv:1703.02532](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02532), [doi:10.1142/S0217732317500791](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217732317500791))

The idea here is to try to match patterns in the [[characteristic classes]] ([[Chern classes]]) of [[complex surfaces]] to properties of [[nuclei]].
