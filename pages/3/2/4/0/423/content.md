#Remarks#

The word 'topology' sometimes means 'the collection of open sets in a [[topological space]]'. In particular, if someone says 'Let $T$ be a topology on $X$', then they mean 'Let $X$ be equipped with the structure of a topological space, and let $T$ be the collection of open sets in this space'.
