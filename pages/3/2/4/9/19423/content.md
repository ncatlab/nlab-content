## Idea

The [[conjecture|conjectured]] _[[duality in string theory|duality]]_ between [[type IIA string theory]] and the theory with working title _[[M-theory]]_ is essentially one half of what defines [[M-theory]] in the first place, namely the statement that [[M-theory]] is the [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] of which the [[string perturbation series]] of [[type IIA string theory]] is the [[perturbation series]].

The second defining characteristic of [[M-theory]] is that at low [[energy]], hence at large [[wavelength]], it is approximated by [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. On the other hand, the low energy limit of [[type IIA string theory]] is [[10d type IIA supergravity]].

In view of this, the conjectured relation between M-theory and [[type IIA string theory]] says, more in detail, that in the low energy limit the relation becomes that exhibited exhibited by the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] to [[10d type IIA supergravity]] on a [[circle]] [[fiber]], such that the [[radius]] of the circle fiber is proportional to the [[coupling constant]] of type II A string theory.

      M-Theory(?) &\stackrel{low\;energy\;limit}{\to}& \text{11d Supergravity}
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{ \array{ small \\ coupling \\ limit}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ \array{KK\;reduction \\ on S^1 }}}
      \\
      \text{type IIA string theory}
        &\stackrel{low\;energy\;effective\;QFT}{\to}&  
      \text{10d Supergravity}
  }
$$

(e.g. [Obers-Pioline 98, p. 12](#ObersPioline98))

One indication for this conjecture is that the [[double dimensional reduction]] of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] that describes the [[super membrane]] (later called the _[[M2-brane]]_) propagating on an [[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[background field|background]] [[spacetime]] yields the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] for the [[type IIA superstring]] propagating on a [[10d type IIA supergravity]] [[background field|background]] ([Duff-Howe-Inami-Stelle 87](#DuffHoweInamiStelle87)).

This observation is the origin of the name "[[M-theory]]", in the first place: As a [non-commital shorthand](M-theory#NonCommittal) for "membrane theory", where the caveat is that, there is at least no _direct_ analog of the [[string perturbation series]] with [[strings]] replaced by [[membranes]].

What convinced the community that [[11-dimensional supergravity]] really is the low energy limit of some non-perturbative version of [[perturbative string theory]] was the arguments given in ([Witten 95](#Witten95)).
