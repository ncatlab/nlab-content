Vladimir Turaev is a mathematician of Russian origin, who has made fundamental contributions to Quantum Field Theory, low dimensional topology, knot theory, and their interactions with mathematical physics and algebra.

He is currently based at Indiana University ([Home page](http://www.math.indiana.edu/people/profile.phtml?id=vtouraev) which is not very informative!)
