## Idea

The **de re/ de dicto** distinction has different meanings, as explained in ([SEP](#SEP)), but it typically concerns the two readings that are possible in sentences where a modal operator or propositional attitude verb is applied to a claim about some subject. For example, consider

* I believe that the person downstairs is my mother

The usual _de dicto_ reading would express my strong hunch about the person who is downstairs that she is my mother. The _de re_ reading would take the expression 'the person downstairs' to designate the person who is actually there, for example, it may in fact be my father. This would entail that I am crazy enough to believe my father to be my mother.

Similarly in the case of [[modal logic]], we could consider a statement such as

+ Someone is necessarily the monarch of this country

_De dicto_ this means that it has to be the case at this time that there be a monarch (as soon as one monarch dies, their successor becomes monarch). On the other hand, _de re_ this means that some specific individual has to be monarch. This reading leads to a false claim since that person might in fact not have been monarch. They might, say, have abdicated earlier or have been killed by their uncle when a child.

Formally, a proposition involving the consecutive application of a [[modal operator]] and an [[existential quantifier]] is called 

* _de dicto_ if the modal operator is applied after the quantifier

  $\Box \underset{x \colon X}{\exists} A(x)$;

* _de re_ if it is the other way around

  $\underset{x \colon X}{\exists} \Box A(x)$;

Hence a difference between de dicto and de re statements is related to the failure of a [[modal operator]] to commute with [[base change]].
