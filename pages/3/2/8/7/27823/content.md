## Idea

The *Topos Institute* is a research institute for [[applied category theory|applications]] of [[category theory]] to various branches of [[science]]. It is led by [[Brendan Fong]] and [[David Spivak]]. 

The Topos Institute runs a series of online talks called the *[Topos Institute Colloquium](topos.institute/events/topos-colloquium)*.

For some years the [[funding of the nLab|donation mechanism]] to the [[nLab]] was handled by the Topos Institute (currently on pause).
