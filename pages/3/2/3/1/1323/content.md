## Definition

###### Definition

A [[category]] $C$  with [[finite products]] $(-)\times(-)$ and [[finite coproducts]] $(-) + (-)$ is called (finitary) **distributive** if for any $X,Y,Z\in C$ the canonical [[distributivity]] morphism
$$ X\times Y + X\times Z \longrightarrow X\times (Y+Z)$$
is an [[isomorphism]].  The canonical morphism is the unique morphism such that $X\times Y \to X\times (Y+Z)$ is $X\times i$, where $i\colon Y\to Y +Z$ is the coproduct injection, and dually for $X\times Z \to X\times (Y+Z)$.

###### Remark

This notion is part of a hierarchy of [[distributivity for monoidal structures]], and generalizes to [[distributive monoidal categories]] and [[rig categories]].  A [[linearly distributive category]] is _not_ distributive in this sense.

=--

This axiom on binary coproducts easily implies the analogous $n$-ary result for $n\gt 2$.  In fact it also implies the analogous 0-ary statement that the projection
$$ X\times 0 \to 0$$
is an isomorphism for any $X$ (see Proposition \ref{nullary} below).  Moreover, for a category with finite products and coproducts to be distributive, it actually suffices for there to be *any* [[natural transformation|natural]] family of isomorphisms $X\times Y + X\times Z \cong X\times (Y+Z)$, not necessarily the canonical ones; see the paper of Lack referenced below.

A category $C$ with finite products and all small coproducts is **infinitary distributive** if the statement applies to all small coproducts.  One can also consider $\kappa$-distributivity for a [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$, meaning the statement applies to coproducts of cardinality $\lt\kappa$.

Any [[extensive category]] is distributive, but the converse is not true.

## Properties

###### Proposition 
In a category with products and coproducts, if products distribute over binary coproducts, then [[coproduct]] [[coprojections]] are [[monomorphism|monic]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $i_B: B \to B + C$ be a coproduct coprojection, and suppose given maps $f, g: A \to B$ such that $i_B f = i_B g$. We observe that the coprojection 

$$i: A \times B \to A \times B + A \times C$$ 

is monic because it has a [[retraction]] $(1_{A \times B}, \phi): A \times B + A \times C \to A \times B$. (All we need here is the existence of a map $\phi: A \times C \to A \times B$, for example the composite $A \times C \stackrel{\pi_A}{\to} A \stackrel{\langle 1_A, f \rangle}{\to} A \times B$.)  

The composite of the coprojection $i$ with the canonical isomorphism $A \times B + A \times C \cong A \times (B + C)$, namely $1_A \times i_B: A \times B \to A \times (B + C)$, is therefore also monic. Given that $\langle 1_A, i_B f \rangle = \langle 1_A, i_B g \rangle: A \to A \times (B + C)$, we conclude 

$$(1_A \times i_B)\langle 1_A, f \rangle = \langle 1_A, i_B f \rangle = \langle 1_A, i_B g \rangle = (1_A \times i_B)\langle 1, g \rangle,$$ 

whence $\langle 1_A, f\rangle = \langle 1_A, g\rangle: A \to A \times B$ since $1_A \times i_B$ is monic. It follows that $f = g$, as was to be shown.

###### Proposition 
If products distribute over binary coproducts, then products distribute over nullary coproducts (i.e., the projection $X \times 0 \to 0$ is an isomorphism for all objects $X$). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We show that $X \times 0$ is initial. Clearly $\hom(X \times 0, Y)$ is inhabited by $X \times 0 \to 0 \to Y$ for any object $Y$. On the other hand, since the two coprojections $0 \to 0 + 0$ coincide, the same holds for the two coprojections $X \times 0 \to (X \times 0) + (X \times 0)$, by applying the distributivity isomorphism $X \times (0 + 0) \cong (X \times 0) + (X \times 0)$. This is enough to show that any two maps $X \times 0 \to Y$ coincide, since given maps $f, g : X \times 0 \to Y$, we have $f = [f, g] \circ i_1 = [f, g] \circ i_2 = g$.

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition  
In a distributive category, the [[initial object]] is [[strict initial object|strict]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Given an arrow $f: A \to 0$, we have that $\pi_A: A \times 0 \to A$ is a retraction of $\langle 1, f \rangle: A \to A \times 0$, so that $A$ is a retract of $A \times 0 \cong 0$. But retracts of initial objects are initial.

## Examples
 {#Examples}


For example:

* the category [[Set]] of [[sets]], 

* any [[topos]], 

* the category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] with respect to forming [[product topological spaces]] and [[disjoint union topological spaces]];

are distributive categories (hence [[distributive monoidal categories]], hence [[rig categories]]).

These categories have in common that they are [[extensive category|extensive]]. An example[^Freyd] of a distributive category that is not extensive is given by

* the category of [[rectangular bands]] which has objects [[semigroup|semigroups]] $X$ satisfying $x x = x$ for all $x\in X$ and $x y x=x$ for all $x,y\in X$.

Since for [[poset|posets]] viewed as categories, finite products and coproducts are given by [[meets]] and [[joins]] we find:

* A [[poset]] viewed as a category is distributive iff it is a [[distributive lattice]]. Accordingly, non distributive lattices provide instances of categories with finite products and coproducts that do not distribute over each other.

A further non-example:

* The category $Pfn$ of sets and [[partial functions|partial functions]] has finite coproducts and products. The former given by [[disjoint unions]] as in [[Set]] and the latter by $(X\times Y)+X+Y$ (where $\times,+$ indicate the usual product and coproduct in $Set$) with projections $\pi_1,\pi_2$ given on the domains of definition $(X\times Y)+X$ (resp. $(X\times Y)+Y$) by $\pi_1((x,y))=x$ and $\pi_1(x)=x$ (resp. $\pi_2((x,y))=y$ and $\pi_2(y)=y$). Since the [[initial object]] $\empty$ is not [[strict initial object|strict]], $Pfn$ is not distributive.
