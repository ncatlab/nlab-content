## Idea

A _continous field of $C^\ast$-algebras_ is a kind of topological [[bundle]] of $C^\ast$-algebras: A [[topological space]] $X$ and a [[C*-algebra]] $A_x$ for each point $ x \in X$, such that these algebras vary continuously, in some sense,  as $x$ varies in $X$. When $X$ is thought of as a [[topological groupoid]] with only [[identity morphisms]], this may be understaood as a special case of [[Fell bundles]] over $X$.

## Applications

### In strict deformation quantization

In [[C* algebraic deformation quantization]] continuous fields of $C^\ast$-algebras over subspaces of the standard [[interval]] (tyically $\{1 , \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \cdots, 0\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]$) such that in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] this becomes a [[Poisson algebra]] constitute [[deformation quantizations]] of this Poisson algebra.
