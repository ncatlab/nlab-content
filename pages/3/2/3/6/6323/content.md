## Idea

_Haag's theorem_ &lbrack;[Haag (1955)](#Haag55), [Hall & Whightman (1957)](#Hall57)&rbrack; says that for a non-[[finite number]] of generators the [[canonical commutation relations]] do _not_ have a unique (up to [[isomorphism]]) [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representation]].

This is in contrast to the *[[Stone-von Neumann theorem]]* which says that for a [[finite number]] of generators the [[Schrödinger representation]] is, up to [[isomorphism]], the unique irreducible unitary representation of the [[canonical commutation relations]].

While [[canonical commutation relations]] with a [[finite number]] of generators appear in [[quantum mechanics]], those appearing in [[quantum field theory]] (see e.g. [[Wick algebras]] for [[free fields]]) generically have infinitely many generators and hence are subject to Haag's theorem.

> More pertinently, the theorem goes on to say that, therefore, the [[interaction picture]] in interacting quantum field theory does not behave as in quantum mechanics...
