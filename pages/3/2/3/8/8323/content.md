## Idea

### General

The _structural rules_ of a [[logic]] or [[deductive system]] are those rules which make no reference to logical operators but only to the unstructured [[premise]]s of a [[deduction]].

In standard [[intuitionistic logic]] the structural rules notably include the [[weakening rule]] and the [[contraction rule]]. Discarding these rules leads to [[linear logic]]. Generally, logical systems discarding some structural rules are called *[[substructural logics]]*.

### In dependent type theory
 {#InDependentTypeTheory}

In ([[intuitionistic type theory|intuitionistic]]) [[dependent type theory]] the structural rules include (e.g. [Jacobs (1998), p. 122](#Jacobs98), [UFP13, A.2.2](#UFP13), [Rijke (2018), Sec. 1.4](#Rijke18)):

* the [[variable rule]], 

* the [[weakening rule]], 

* the [[substitution rule]]

shown in the following table together with their [[categorical semantics]] [[categorical semantics of dependent types|of dependent types]]:

## Examples

* the [[weakening rule]],

* the [[contraction rule]],

* the [[exchange rule]],

* the [[identity rule]],

* the [[cut rule]].


## Related pages

* [[substructural logic]] is logic in which one or more structural rules are omitted.
