## Idea

### General

The _structural rules_ of a [[logic]] or [[deductive system]] are those rules which make no reference to logical operators but only to the unstructured [[premise]]s of a [[deduction]].

In standard [[intuitionistic logic]] the structural rules notably include the [[weakening rule]] and the [[contraction rule]]. Discarding these rules leads to [[linear logic]]. Generally, logical systems discarding some structural rules are called *[[substructural logics]]*.

### In dependent type theory
 {#InDependentTypeTheory}

In ([[intuitionistic type theory|intuitionistic]]) [[dependent type theory]] the structural rules include (e.g. [Jacobs (1998), p. 122](#Jacobs98), [UFP13, A.2.2](#UFP13), [Rijke (2018), Sec. 1.4](#Rijke18)):

* the [[variable rule]], 

* the [[weakening rule]], 

* the [[substitution rule]]

shown in the following table together with their [[categorical semantics]] [[categorical semantics of dependent types|of dependent types]]:

## Examples


* [[structural rules]]

  * [[identity rule]]

  * [[weakening rule]]

  * [[contraction rule]]

  * [[exchange rule]]

  * [[substitution rule]]

  * [[cut rule]]


## Sub-structural logic

If some of the structural rules are *not* imposed in a [[formal logic]] one speaks of *[[substructural logic]]*.

For instance, if the [[weakening rule]] and [[contraction rule]] are omitted, one speaks of [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] (see [there](linear+logic#AbsenceOfWeakeningAndContraction)), since then the [[logical conjunction]] is no longer consrained to behave like a [[Cartesian product]] but may behave like a non-cartesian [[tensor product]].
