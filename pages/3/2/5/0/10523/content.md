Many-body systems, that is physical systems comprising many interacting particles are called strongly correlated if the interactions are strong in the sense that they are causing configurations which are not just perturbations of the non-interacting or weakly interacting system; and in which the correlations between different particles are also strong. Examples include physical [[plasma]], strongly correlated electron systems, many models of magnetism, frustrated magnetism, High-Tc superconductivity. Because of involved nonlinearity and or
