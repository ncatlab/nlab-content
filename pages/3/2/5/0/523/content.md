I am a math PhD student at Hamburg University. I am working on higher categorial structures in physics, in particular on bundle gerbes.

**Abstract:**
We establish a model category structure on algebraic Kan complexes. In fact, we introduce the notion of an algebraic fibrant 
object in a general model category (obeying certain technichal conditions). Based on this construction we propose algebraic Kan complexes as an algebraic model for $\infty$-groupoids and algebraic quasicategories as an algebraic model for $(\infty,1)$-categories.
