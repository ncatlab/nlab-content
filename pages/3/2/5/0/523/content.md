I am a math PhD student at Hamburg University. I am working on [[higher category theory|higher categorial structures]] in physics, in particular on [[bundle gerbe]]s.

  **Abstract:** We establish a [[model category]] structure on algebraic [[Kan complex]]es. In fact, we introduce the notion of an algebraic fibrant 
object in a general model category (obeying certain technical conditions). Based on this construction we propose algebraic Kan complexes as an algebraic model for [[∞-groupoid]]s and algebraic [[quasi-categories]] as an algebraic model for [[(∞,1)-categories]].
