## Idea


A "branched" or "ramified" covering space is much like a plain [[covering space]], only that over suitable subspaces, such as isolated points, in the base space -- called the _branch points_ or _ramification points_ -- sheets of the covering may merge, hence that the [[group]] of [[cover automorphisms]] has [[fixed points]] here.


The archetypical examples are in [[complex analysis]] and here the most archetypical example of all is the [[graph of a function|graph]] of (any choice of) the  [[square root]] function on the [[complex plane]], which is a [[double cover]] away from the point at the origin, but including the origin it is a branched double cover with branch point that origin

[[Isbell duality|Dually]] branching is reflected in [[rings of functions]] by [[ramification of ideals]].

Notably under the [[function field analogy]] one may also understand [[ramification of ideals]] in [[number fields]] as encoding branched coverings ("over Spec([[F1]])")

## Examples

### Branched covers of $n$-spheres
 {#BranchedCoversOfNSpheres}

Every $n$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[PL manifold]] admits a branched covering of the [[n-sphere]] ([Alexander 20](#Alexander20)). 

By the [[Riemann existence theorem]], every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] admits the [[structure]] of a branched cover by a [[holomorphic function]] to the [[Riemann sphere]]. See [there](branched+cover+of+the+Riemann+sphere#RiemannSurfaces) at _[[branched cover of the Riemann sphere]]_.

For [[3-manifolds]] branched covering the [[3-sphere]] see ([Montesinos 74](#Montesinos74)).


All [[PL manifold|PL]] [[4-manifolds]] are _simple_ branched covers of the  [[4-sphere]] ([Piergallini 95](#Piergallini95), [Iori-Piergallini 02](#IoriPiergallini02)).

But the [[n-torus]] for $n \geq 3$ is _not a [[cyclic group|cyclic]]_ branched over of the [[n-sphere]] ([Hirsch-Neumann 75](#HirschNeumann75))
