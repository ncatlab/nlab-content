## Idea


A "branched" or "ramified" covering spaces is much like a plain [[covering space]], only that over isolated points in the base space -- called the _branch point_ or _ramification points_ -- sheets of the covering may merge.


The archetypical examples in [[complex analysis]] and here the most archetypical example of all is the [[graph of a function|graph]] of (any choice of) the  [[square root]] function on the [[complex plane]], which is a double cover away from the point at the origin, but including the origin it is a branched double cover with branch point that origin

[[Isbell duality|Dually]] branching is reflected in [[rings of functions]] by [[ramification of ideals]].

Notably under the [[function field analogy]] one may also understand [[ramification of ideals]] in [[number fields]] as encoding branched coverings ("over Spec([[F1]])")

## Examples
