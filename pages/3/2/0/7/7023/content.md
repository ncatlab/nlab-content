## Idea

The notion [[duality|dual]] to [[operad]]. 

Cooperads are to operads as [[coalgebras]] are to [[algebras]].

Note that a cooperad is not the same notion as a one-object **comulticategory**, which is a structure akin to a [[multicategory]], except in which multimorphisms have unary domain and multiary codomain.
