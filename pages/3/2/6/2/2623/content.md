QED assigns an integral to each Feynman diagram for the purposes of computing the probability of an outcome in a scattering experiment. These integrals often come out infinite.  Regularization adds a parameter to the integral so we get a Laurent series instead of infinity; the Laurent series diverges when the parameter is set to the point of interest.  Renormalization throws away the polar part of the series; when we evaluate the resulting Taylor series at the point of interest, the result is finite.
