## Idea

Given a suitable [[line object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$ in a suitable ambient [[(∞,1)-topos]], then there exists the [[cohomology localization]] at [[morphisms]] that induces [[equivalences]] in [[cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{A}^1$. 

In this case the [[right adjoint]] to the reflector typically has the interpretation of producing [[spaces]] which are "affine" in that they are entirely characterized by their [[function algebras on ∞-stacks|function ∞-algebra]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{A}^1$.

Therefore in this case the [[localization]] [[modality]] deserves to be called the _affine modality_.

## Examples

Examples for this in [[higher geometry|higher]] [[algebraic geometry]] and [[synthetic differential geometry]] are discussed at _[[function algebras on ∞-stacks]]_ in the section _[Localization of the (∞,1)-topos at R-cohomology](function+algebras+on+infinity-stacks#Intrinsic)_.
