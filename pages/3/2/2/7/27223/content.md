## Idea

Quantum inverse scattering method (QISM) is a method of solving quantum integrable systems inspired by [[classical inverse scattering method]]. It springs from the quantum inverse scattering problem: find the quantum potential from all the scattering data. 

[[quantum groups|Quantum groups]] were discovered within development of QISM, where they play a prominent role.
