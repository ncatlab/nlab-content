A [[category]] is **small** if it has a [[set]] of objects and a set of morphisms.  In other words, a small category is an [[internal category]] in the category [[Set]].

A category is said to be **essentially small** if it is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a small category.  Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], this is the same as saying that it has a small [[skeleton]], or equivalently that it is [[locally small category|locally small]] and has a small number of isomorphism classes of objects.

A **small category structure** on a category $C$ is an [[essentially surjective functor]] from a set (as a [[discrete category]]) to $C$.  A categeory is essentially small iff it has a small category structure; this does not require the axiom of choice.
