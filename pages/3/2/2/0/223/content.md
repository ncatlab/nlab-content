## Definition

A [[category]] is **small** if it has a [[small set]] of [[object]]s and a [[small set]] of [[morphism]]s.  

In other words, a small category is an [[internal category]] in the category [[Set]].

A category which is not small may be called [[large category|large]], especially when it is not *essentially* small (see below).


## Properties

Small categories are free of some of the subtleties that apply to large categories.

A category is said to be **essentially small** (or, rarely, **svelte**) if it is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a small category.  Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], this is the same as saying that it has a small [[skeleton]], or equivalently that it is [[locally small category|locally small]] and has a [[small set|small number]] of isomorphism classes of objects.

A **small category structure** on a [[locally small category]] $C$ is an [[essentially surjective functor]] from a set (as a [[discrete category]]) to $C$.  A category is essentially small iff it is locally small and has a small category structure; unlike the previous paragraph, this result does not require the axiom of choice.

## Characterisations

The following are equivalent for a [[locally small]] category $B$ (see the linked [MathOverflow answer](#KoudenburgMathOverflow)).

1. $B$ is essentially small.
2. The [[category of presheaves]] $[B^{op}, Set]$ is [[locally small]].
3. For every presheaf $q : B^{op} \to Set$ and copresheaf $p : B \to Set$ the coend $\int^{y \in B} py \times qy$ is [[small presheaf|small]].
4. Every presheaf on $B$ is [[small presheaf|small]].
5. For every functor $F : B \to C$ with [[locally small]] codomain, and for every object $c \in C$, the presheaf $C(F{-}, c) : B^{op} \to Set$ is [[small presheaf|small]].

These different characterisations are useful, because they give a way to capture the notion of size in [[formal category theory]]. For instance, characterisation (2) is axiomatised in the formalism of **small objects** in [[Yoneda structures]]; whereas characterisation (5) is axiomatised in the formalism of **petit objects** in [[KZ-doctrines]] (see [DL23](#DL23)).

## Smallness in the context of universes
 {#SmallnessInTheContextOfUniverses}

If [[Grothendieck universe]]s are being used, then for $U$ a fixed Grothendieck universe, a category $C$ is **$U$-small** if its collection of objects and collection of morphisms are both elements of $U$. Thus, 

* a $U$-small category is a category [[internal category|internal to]] $U Set$.

This of course is a [[material set theory|material]] formulation. We may call $C$ **structurally $U$-small** if there is a [[bijection]] from its set of morphisms to an element of $U$ (the same for the set of objects follows). This gives an up-to-isomorphism version of $U$-smallness (see [[universe in a topos]] for an alternative structural formulation). Such structural $U$-smallness may be substituted in the discussion below. 

Let $U\Set$ be the category of $U$-small sets. Similar considerations lead us to say

* a $U$-category (a [[locally small category|locally U-small]])-category is a category [[enriched category|enriched over]] $U Set$,  

and that a category $C$ **essentially $U$-small** if it is locally $U$-small and admits an essentially surjective functor from a discrete $U$-small category. 

A category is **$U$-moderate** if its set of objects and set of morphisms are both subsets of $U$.  However, some categories (such as the category of $U$-moderate categories!) are larger yet.
