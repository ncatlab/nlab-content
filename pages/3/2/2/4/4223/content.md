## Idea

The **Poincar&#233; Lemma** asserts that if a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is [[contractible]], then its [[de Rham cohomology]] vanishes in positive degree.

In other words: if $X$ is contractible then for every closed [[differential form]] $\omega \in \Omega^k_{cl}(X)$ with $k \geq 1$ there exists a differential form $\lambda \in \Omega^{k-1}(X)$ such that 

$$
  \omega = d_{dR} \lambda
  \,.
$$
