## Idea

Given a [[modal operator|(co-)modal operator]] $\Box$, then a [[type]] $X$ may be called _$\Box$-anti-modal_ if $\Box X \simeq \ast$.

Since a type $Y$ is called a _$\Box$-[[modal type]]_ if $\Box Y \simeq Y$, being anti-modal is in a sense indeed the opposite extreme of being modal.


In as far as [[modal operators]] have [[categorical semantics]] as [[idempotent monads|idempotent (co-)-mondads]]/[[idempotent (∞,1)-monads|idempotent (∞,1)-(co-)monads]] anti-modal types are familiar in [[homotopy theory]] as forming [[localizing subcategories]].

## Examples

* an [[anti-reduced type]] is an [[infinitesimally thickened point]]
