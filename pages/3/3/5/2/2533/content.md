## Definition

**Discrete mathematics** is a term used to refer to an introductory course in the undergraduate [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] curricula, devoted to teaching an overview of elementary [[combinatorics]] and its prerequisites such as na√Øve [[set theory]], basic [[predicate logic]], an introduction to [[proofs]], and elementary [[number theory]]. 

It is also sometimes used in research mathematics as a synonym to [[combinatorics]] and closely related fields (or subfields): finite geometry and [[incidence geometry]], [[coding theory]] and [[Boolean functions]], combinatorics of [[posets]], [[matroid]] theory, convex geometry and [[polytopes]], packings, tilings, etc.
