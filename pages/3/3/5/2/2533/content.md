## Definition 

**Discrete mathematics** is about mathematical structures that are "discrete" in some sense. However, there is no one single definition of a "discrete structure", and thus no one single definition of "discrete mathematics". 

Different definitions of discrete mathematics may include:

* The study of [[countable sets]] and mathematical structures on countable sets (as in [[combinatorics]])

* The study of [[discrete categories]] and mathematical structures on discrete categories

* The study of [[discrete infinity-groupoids]] and mathematical structures on discrete infinity-groupoids

* A class taught at the introductory university level, in the same way that [[algebra]] could also refer to a class taught in secondary education. 

and so forth. Furthermore, there isn't a clear delineation between discrete mathematics and other fields. The study of [[graph theory]] is usually considered a part of discrete mathematics, and [[quivers]], [[globular sets]], and [[simplicial sets]] are part of graph theory (being higher directed graphs), but are frequently used in [[higher category theory]] and [[(infinity,1)-category theory]] to combinatorially model objects such as [[categories]] and [[infinity-groupoids]].
