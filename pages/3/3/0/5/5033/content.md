## Idea

By **$(\infty,1)Topos$** is denoted the collection of all [[(∞,1)-topos]]es. This is the [[(∞,1)-category]]-theory analog of [[Topos]].

## Definition

**$(\infty,1)\,Topos$**  is the (non-full) [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,1)Cat]] on [[(∞,1)-toposes]] and [[(∞,1)-geometric morphisms]] between them.

Morally, this should actually be an [[(∞,2)-category]], just as [[Topos]] is a [[2-category]], but since the technology of $(\infty,2)$-categories is not well developed, this point of view is not often taken yet.


## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,1)Topos$ has all small $(\infty,1)$-colimits and the inclusion

$$
  (\infty,1)Topos \hookrightarrow (\infty,1)Cat
$$

preserves these.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.3.2.3]].


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,1)Topos$ has all small $(\infty,1)$-colimits and the inclusion

$$
  (\infty,1)Topos^{op} \hookrightarrow (\infty,1)Cat
$$

sends [[(∞,1)-limit]]s to [[(∞,1)-limit]]s.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Propoisition

The $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,1)Topos$ has [[filtered (infinity,1)-category|filtered]] [[(∞,1)-limit]]s and the inclusion

$$
  (\infty,1)Topos \hookrightarrow (\infty,1)Cat
$$

preserves these.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.3.3.1]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Propoisition

The $(\infty,1)$-category $(\infty,1)Topos$ has all small [[(∞,1)-limit]]s.


=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.3.4.7]].

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

The $(\infty,1)$-limits in $(\infty,1)Topos$ coincide actually with the proper $(\infty,2)$-limits.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, remark 6.3.4.10]].
