#Definition#

Vertical categorification refers roughly to a process in which ordinary [[category theory|categories]] are replaced by [[higher category theory|higher categories]].

Vertical categorification is closely related to the process of relaxing properties of structures to hold only _up to homotopy_.

#Remarks#

This is in contrast to [[horizontal categorification]].
If you call that 'oidification', then you can call this simply 'categorification'.

#Examples#

* One notion of vertical categorification of **abelian groups** are _chain complexes of abelian groups_ which, if in non-negative degree, are equivalent to $\omega$-[[omega categories|categories]] internal to $AbelianGroups$. (See the [[Doldâ€“Kan theorem]].)

* Familiar vertical categorifications/homotopifications of algebraic structures inclused

  * algebras $\stackrel{vertical categ.}{\to}$ $A_\infty$-algbebras

  * Lie algebras $\stackrel{vertical categ.}{\to}$ $L_\infty$-algbebras
