A (left) __artinian ring__ $R$ is a [[ring]] for which every descending chain $R=I_0\supset I_1\supset I_2\supset \ldots \supset I_n\supset\ldots$ of its (left) [[ideal]]s stabilizes, i.e. there is $n_0$ such that $I_{n+1}=I_n$ for all $n\geq n_0$. A ring is artinian if it is both left artinian and right artinian. 

In an artinian ring $R$ the [[Jacobson radical]] $J(R)$ is [[nilpotent ideal|nilpotent]]. A left artinian ring is semiprimitive if and only if the zero ideal is the unique nilpotent ideal.

A dual condition is noetherian: a __[[noetherian ring]]__ is a ring satisfying the ascending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is severely broken if one considers unital rings: for example every unital artinian ring is noetherian. For a converse there is a strong condition: a left (unital) ring $R$ is left artinian iff $R/J(R)$ is semisimple in $_R Mod$ and the Jacobson radical $J(R)$ is nilpotent. Artinian rings are intuitively much smaller than generic noetherian rings.
