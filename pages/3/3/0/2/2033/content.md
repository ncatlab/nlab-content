A (left) __artinian ring__ $R$ is a [[ring]] for which every descending chain of its (left) [[ideal]]s stabilizes.
A ring is artinian if it is both left artinian and right artinian. 

In an artinian ring the Jacobson radical is nilpotent.

A dual condition is noetherian: a __[[noetherian ring]]__ is a ring satisfying the ascending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is severely broken if one considers unital rings: for example every unital artinian ring is noetherian; artinian rings are intuitively much smaller than generic noetherian rings.
