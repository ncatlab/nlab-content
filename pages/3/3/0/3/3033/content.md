# contact {#contact} 

The best way to contact me is by sending me an email at <fiorenza@mat.uniroma1.it>

# my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in [[mathematics|math]] from the University of Pisa. Have been a postdoc in mathematics for three years (in Roma Tor Vergata and Sapienza). Since 2005 I am assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.mat.uniroma1.it">Sapienza - Universit&#224; di Roma</a>

# my research {#myresearch}

I'm principally interested in categorical constructions arising from theoretical [[physics]]. Something like a personal research wiki with more information is beginning to develop at

* [[domenicofiorenza:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]].

My **research interest**: detalis to be added



# exchange of thoughts {#exchangeofthoughts}

I enjoy exchanging thoughts on topics of interest for my research and always felt it would be a pity not to use the web for that purpose. To satisfy that need I use to work on

*  the wiki [The nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) (this wiki here).

* [[domenicofiorenza:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]]

# beta versions {#betaversions}

Here is where I develop revisions of nLab entries which (from my point of view) deserve consistent revision. By this I do not mean these entries  are wrong (in any sense you can give to this word); what I mean is that there are a few entries which have been edited severla times and have suffered an excess of stratification (add a line today, add another tomorrow...). So it could be not a bad idea to clean up thema a bit. As revision is complete I'll post them on the nLab. Everything you find here is work in progress: please, edit it!

Currently revising:

* [[domenicofiorenza:twisted cohomology|twisted cohomology]]

* [[domenicofiorenza:over quasi-category|over quasi-category]]

* [[domenicofiorenza:limit|limit]]
