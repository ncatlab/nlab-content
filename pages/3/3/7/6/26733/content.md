## Idea

[[cyclic group of order 2|$C_2$]]-[[equivariant homotopy theory|equivariant]] [[homotopy groups of spheres]] are particularly amenable to study because they are computed in a range by $\mathbb{R}$-[[motivic homotopy theory|motivic]] homotopy groups of spheres via real [Betti realization](motivic+homotopy+theory#RealizationFunctors).
