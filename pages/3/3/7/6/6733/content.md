## Idea

In [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the [[brane]] electrically charged under the [[supergravity C-field]] is the [[M2-brane]]/[[membrane]]. The dual under [[electric-magnetic duality]] is the M5-brane.

## Definition

### As a Green-Schwarz type sigma-model

As a [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]]: [BLNPST 97](#BLNPST97)

### As a black $p$-brane

As a [[black brane]] solution of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the M5-brane is given ([Gueven 92](#Gueven92)) by the [[spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{5,1} \times (\mathbb{R}^5-\{0\})$ with [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] given by

$$
  g = H^{-1/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^{5,1}} \oplus H^{2/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^5-\{0\}}
$$

for $H = 1 + \frac{1}{r}$ and $r$ the distance in $\mathbb{R}^5$ from the origin, and with [[field strength]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] being

$$
  F = \star_{\mathbb{R}^5} \mathbf{d}H
  \,.
$$

This is a $1/2$-[[BPS state]] of 11-dimensional supergravity.

The [[near horizon geometry]] of this spacetime is [[anti de Sitter spacetime|AdS7]]$\times$[[4-sphere|S4]]. For more on this see at _[[AdS-CFT]]_.

### At an orbifold singularity
 {#AtAnOrbifoldSingularity}

{#NearHorizonOrbifold} More generally for 1/2 BPS black M5-branes, the near horizon geometry is $AdS_7 \times S^4/G$, where $G$ is a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] ([[ADE classification|ADE subgroup]]) acting by left multiplication on the [[quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$ in the canonical way, under the identitfication $S^4 \simeq S(\mathbb{R}^5) \simeq S(\mathbb{R}\oplus \mathbb{H})$ ([MFF 12, section 8.3](#MFF12)).

While this geometric discussion in [MFF 12, section 8.3](#MFF12) works for all the [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]], folklore has it that in [[M-theory]] the M5-branes appear only at A-type singularities, while the more general [[6d (2,0)-superconformal field theories]] for all possible [[ADE-singularities]] appear only after passage to [[F-theory]] ([ZHTV 14, p. 3](#ZHTV14)).

On the other hand, when placing the M5 at an MO5-[[orientifold]] ([Witten 95](#Witten95)) its worldvolume theory breaks from $(2,0)$ to $(1,0)$-supersymmetry and all ADE-singularities should be allowed.

(...)


## Properties

### Worldvolume theory

the [[worldvolume]] theory of the M5-brane is the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]].

This [[worldvolume]] theory involves [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] kind ([Witten07](#Witten07), [Witten09](#Witten09)): the fields are supposed to be [[connections on a 2-bundle]]($\sim$ [[gerbe]]), presumably with structure [[2-group]] the [[automorphism 2-group]] $AUT(G)$ of some [[Lie group]] $G$. 

For instance in the proposal of ([SSW11](#SSW11)) one sees in equation (2.1) _almost_ the data of an $\mathfrak{aut}(\mathfrak{g})$-[[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms|Lie 2-algebra valued forms]].

### Branes inside the M5

The M5-brane admits two solitonic excitations ($p$-branes within branes)

* $p = 1$: the [[self-dual string]]

* $p = 3$: the [[3-brane in 6d]] (see there for more)

See also 

* [[M2-M5 brane bound state]]

### Dimensional reduction

On [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensional reduction]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle the M5-brane turns into the [[NS5-brane]] and the [[D-brane|D4-brane]] of [[type II string theory]].

The [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the 5-brane on a [[Riemann surface]] yields as [[worldvolume]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]. See at _[N=2 D=4 SYM -- Construction by compactification of 5-branes](N%3D2+D%3D4+super+Yang-Mills+theory#ConstructionByCompactificationOf5Branes)_.

### Holographic dual

The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] for the 5-brane is $AdS_7/CFT_6$ and relates the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] to [[7-dimensional supergravity]] obtained by [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduction]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a 4-[[sphere]] to an asymptotically 7d [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

### Conformal blocks and 7d Chern-Simons dual
 {#7dCSDual}

The [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-dual 2-connection]]-field (see there for more details) on the 6-dimensional [[worldvolume]] M5-brane is supposed to have a [[holographic principle|holographic]] description in terms of a [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] ([Witten 1996](#Witten96)). We discuss the relevant "fractional" [[quadratic form]] on [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that defines the correct [[action functional]].

Let $\hat G$ be the [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] on a 7-dimensional manifold $X$ with boundary the M5-brane, thought of as the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] down to [[7-dimensional supergravity]].

As discussed there, the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]] on these 3-connections is

$$
  \hat G_4 \mapsto
  \exp(i \int_X \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4)
  \,,
$$

where 

* $\exp(i \int_X (-))$ is the [[higher holonomy]] / [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] from $X$ to the point

* of the [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]] [[circle n-bundle with connection|7-connection]] $\hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4$.

The space of [[states]] of this 7d theory on the M5 worldvolume $\partial X$ would be the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]].

Except, that it turns out that the [[first Chern class]] of the corresponding [[prequantum line bundle]] is _twice_ that required from [[geometric quantization]].

Therefore the above action functional is not yet the correct one, but only a fractional version of it is. However, the class $G_4 \cup G_4$ in [[integral cohomology]] has in general no reason to be divisible by 2.

This is related to the fact that as a [[quadratic form]] on the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] group $\hat H^4(X)$, the above is not a [[quadratic refinement]] of 

$$
  (\hat G, \hat G') \mapsto \exp(i \int_X \hat G \cup \hat G') 
  \,,
$$

but of twice that. In ([Witten 1996](#Witten96)) it was argued, and later clarified in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)), that instead the action functional should be replaced by a proper [[quadratic refinement]].

This is accomplished by shifting the center of the [[quadratic form]]
by a lift $\lambda \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of the degree-4 [[Wu class]] $\nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ from 0 to $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$. 

(For that to make sense in [[integral cohomology]], either the [[Wu class]] $\lambda$ happens to be divisible by 2 on $X$, or else one has to regard it itself as a twisted differential character of sorts, as explained in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)). For the moment we will assume that $X$ is such that $\lambda$ is divisbible by 2.)

Since $X$, being a [[spacetime]] for [[supergravity]], admits (and is thought to be equipped with) a [[spin structure]], by the discussion at [[Wu class]] it follows that $\lambda$ is the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\frac{1}{2}p_1$

$$
  (\frac{1}{2}p_1 \; mod \; 2) 
   \; 
     =
   \; 
   \nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)
  \,.
$$

By the very definition of [[Wu class]], it follows that for any $\hat \alpha \in \hat H^4(X)$ the combination

$$
  \hat \alpha \cup \hat \alpha + \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda = Sq^4(\hat \alpha) - \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda
  \; =\;  0 \;  mod  \; 2
$$

is divisible by 2.

Therefore define then the modified quadratic form

$$
  \exp(i S^\lambda) 
   \; : \; 
  \hat a \mapsto \exp i \int_X 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \left(
    \hat a \cup \hat a
    + 
    \hat a \cup \hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \right)
$$

(see [[differential string structure]] for the definition of the differential refinement $\hat \mathbf{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$),
where, note, we have included a global factor of 2, which is now possible due to the inclusion of the integral lift of the Wu class.

Notice that where the [[equations of motion]] of the original [[action functional]] are $\hat a = 0$, those of this shifted one are $\hat a = - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}$. One may therefor calls $-\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ here a _background [[charge]]_ for the 7-d Chern-Simons theory.

This is now indeed a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]]:

$$
  \exp i \left( 
    S^\lambda\left(\hat a + \hat b \right)
    - 
    S^\lambda\left( \hat a \right)
    - 
    S^\lambda\left( \hat b \right)
    + 
    S^\lambda\left( 0 \right)
  \right)
  = 
  \exp i \int_X ( \hat a \cup \hat b  )
  \,.
$$

To express the correct action functional for the 7d Chern-Simons theory it is useful to define the shifted [[supergravity C-field]]

$$
  \hat a  := \hat G_4 - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \,,
$$

which the object whose [[equations of motion]] with respect to the 7d Chern-Simons theory are still $\hat a = 0$.

Then in terms of the original $\hat G_4$ the action functional for the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7d Chern-Simons theory]] reads

$$
  \exp(i S(\hat G_4))
  = 
  \exp(i \int_X
    \frac{1}{2}
    (
      \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4  
      -
      (\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda})^2
    )
  )
  \,.
$$

This is the action as it appears in ([Witten96, (3.6)](#Witten96)).

In terms of [[twisted differential c-structures]] we may summarize the outcome of this reasoning as follows:

_The divisibility of the action functional requires a $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted Wu structure]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$-cohomology. Its lift to integral cohomology is the $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted differential string structure]] known as the "Witten quantization condition" on the [[supergravity C-field]]_.

### Restriction of the supergravity $C$-field
 {#RestrictionOfTheCField}

We discuss the conditions on the 
restriction of the [[supergravity C-field]] on the ambient 
[[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[spacetime]] to the M5-brane.

This is similar to the analogous situation in [[type II string theory]].
The [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] condition demands that
the restriction of the [[B-field]] $\hat H_3 \hat H^3(X)$ 
on spacetime $X$ to an 
[[orientation|oriented]] [[D-brane]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$ has
to trivialize, up to [[torsion]], relative to the integral 
[[Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_3 = \beta(w_2)$, where
$\beta$ is the [[Bockstein homomorphism]] induced from the 
[[short exact sequence]] $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}
\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2$:

$$
  H_3|_Q \simeq W_3
  \,,
$$

thus defining a [[twisted spin^c-structure]] on the [[D-brane]].

The analog of this for the M5-brane is discussed in 
([Witten00, section 5](#Witten2000)). There it is argued that
there is a class 

$$
  \theta \in H^3(Q, U(1))
$$

on the 5-brane such that under the [[Bockstein homomorphism]]
$\beta'$ induced by the [[short exact sequence]]
$\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \to U(1)$ we have for the
[[supergravity C-field]] $\hat G \in \hat H^4(X)$ the condition

$$
  G|_Q = \beta'(\theta)
  \,.
$$

By the [above](#7dCSDual) quantization condition, this may also be thought of
as witnessing a [[twisted string structure]] on the 5-brane ([Sati](#Sati10)).

This condition reduces to the above one for the $B$-field under [[double dimensional reduction]] on the circle.

### M5-brane charge

### Anomaly cancellation
 {#AnomalyCancellation}

Consider an 11-dimensional [[spin structure|spin]]-[[manifold]] $X^{(11)}$ and a 2-parameter family of 6-dimensional [[submanifolds]] $Q_{M5} \hookrightarrow X^{(11)}$. When regarded as a family of [[worldvolumes]] of an [[M5-brane]], the family of [[normal bundles]] $N_X Q_{M5}$ of this inclusion carries a [[characteristic class]]

\[
  \label{IM5}
  I^{M5}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  I^{M5}_{\psi} 
  + 
  I_{C}
  \;\in\;
  H^8(F \times Q_{M5},\mathbb{Z})
\]

where

1. the first summand is the class of the [[chiral anomaly]] of [[chiral fermions]] on $Q_{M5}$ ([Witten 96, (5.1)](#Witten96)), 

1. the second term the class of the [[quantum anomaly]] of a [[self-dual higher gauge field]] ([Witten 96, (5.4)](#Witten96))

Moreover, there is the restriction of the [[I8]]-term (see [there](I8#eq:TheTerm)) to $Q_{M5}$, hence to the [[tangent bundle]] of $X^{11}$ to $Q_{M5}$ (the "anomaly inflow" from the [[bulk spacetime]] to the M5-brane)

\[
  \label{I8AnomalyInflow}
  I_8\vert_{M5}
  \;\coloneqq\;
   I_8
   \big(
     T_{Q_{M5}} X
   \big)
  \;\in\;
  H^8(F \times Q_{M5},\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
\]

The sum of these cohomology classes, evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $Q_{M5}$ is proportional to the [[second Pontryagin class]] of the [[normal bundle]]

\[
  \label{SumOfM5AndInflowAnomalyIsp2}
  I^{M5}
  \;+\;
  I_8\vert_{M5}
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{24} p_2(N_{Q_{M5}})
\]

([Witten 96 (5.7)](#Witten96))

This result used to be "somewhat puzzling" ([Witten 96, p. 35](#Witten96)) since consistency of the [[M5-brane]] in [[M-theory]] should require its total [[quantum anomaly]] to vanish. But $p_2(N_{Q_{M5}})$ does not in general vanish, and the right conditions to require under which it does vanish were "not clear" ([Witten 96, p. 37](#Witten96)).

(For more details on computations involved this and the following arguments, see also [Bilal-Metzger 03](#BilalMetzger03)).

A resolution was proposed in ([Freed-Harvey-Minasian-Moore 98](#FreedHarveyMinasianMoore98)), further clarified in ([Monnier 13](#Monnier13)), see also ([Bah-Bonetti-Minasian-Nardoni 18](#BahBonettiMinasianNardoni18)). There it is asserted that 

1. the correct bulk anomaly inflow is not just that from $I_8$ itself, but includes also a contribution from the class $G_4$ of the [[supergravity C-field]], as per (eq:FiberIntegration) below ([Monnier 13, around (3.11)](#Monnier13));

1. for $G^{M5}_4$ the "restriction" of the class of the [[supergravity C-field]] to $Q_{M5}$, the term $I^{M5}_{C}$ in (eq:IM5) should have a further summand $-\tfrac{1}{2}\big( G_4^{M5} \big)^2$ ([Monnier 13, around (3.7)](#Monnier13), using [Monnier 14b, (2.13)](#Monnier14b))



1. for 11d spacetime a [[4-sphere]]-[[fiber bundle]], 

   $$
     \array{
        S^4 &\longrightarrow& X^{(11)} 
        \\
        && \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
        \\
        && X^{(6)}
     }
   $$ 
  
   as befits the [[near horizon geometry]] of a [[black brane|black]] [[M5-brane]], the [[supergravity C-field]] should be taken to be of the form ([Monnier 13, (3.12)](#Monnier13))

   $$
     G_4 =\coloneqq \tfrac{1}{2}\chi + \pi^\ast(G^{M5}_4)
   $$ 
   
   with $\tfrac{1}{2}\chi$ the degree-4 [[Euler class]], whose integral over the 4-sphere fiber is unity ([this Prop.](Sullivan+model+of+a+spherical+fibration#SullivanModelForSphericalFibration)), reflecting the presence of a single M5.

By this proposal (also [Bah-Bonetti-Minasian-Nardoni 18 (5)](#BahBonettiMinasianNardoni18), [BBMN 19 (2.9) and appendix A.4, A.5](#BBMN19)), the anomaly inflow from the bulk would not be just $I_8$, as in (eq:I8AnomalyInflow) but would be all of the following [[fiber integration]] 

\[
  \label{FiberIntegration}
  \array{
    \pi_\ast
    \Big(
      -
      \tfrac{1}{6}
      G_4  G_4  G_4
      +
      G_4  I_8
    \Big)
    & =
    - \tfrac{1}{24} p_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(G^{M5}_4)^2 + I_8
  }
\]

Here  we used [this Prop](Spin5#FiberIntegrationOfCupPowersOfChiOver4Sphere) to find that 

$$
  \pi_\ast\big(
    \chi^3
  \big)
  \;=\;
  2 p_2
$$

which would cancel against the first term $\tfrac{1}{24} p_2$ in (eq:FiberIntegration). Hence with this proposal, the remaining M5-brane anomaly (eq:SumOfM5AndInflowAnomalyIsp2) would be canceled.

### Hopf-Wess-Zumino term
 {#ReferencesHopfWessZuminoTerm}

The [[higher dimensional WZW model|higher WZW term]] of the M5-brane ([[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term]]) was first proposed in

* {#Aharony94} [[Ofer Aharony]], p. 11 of _String theory dualities from M theory_, Nucl. Phys. B476:470-483, 1996 ([arXiv:hep-th/9604103](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9604103))

and had been settled by the time of 

* [BLNPST 97 (1)](#BLNPST97).

The resemblence of the first summand of the term to the [[Whitehead integral formula]] for the [[Hopf invariant]] was noticed in

* {#Intriligator00} [[Kenneth Intriligator]], _Anomaly Matching and a Hopf-Wess-Zumino Term in 6d, N=(2,0) Field Theories_, Nucl.Phys. B581 (2000) 257-273 ([arXiv:hep-th/0001205](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0001205))

which hence introduced the terminology "Hopf-Wess-Zumino term". Followup to this terminology includes

* {#KalkkinenStelle02} Jussi Kalkkinen, [[Kellogg Stelle]], Section 3.2 of: _Large Gauge Transformations in M-theory_, J. Geom. Phys. 48 (2003) 100-132 ([arXiv:hep-th/0212081](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212081))

### Anomaly cancellation
 {#ReferencesAnomalyCancellation}

The original computation of the total M5-brane anomaly due to 

* [Witten 96](#Witten96)

left a remnant term of $\tfrac{1}{24} p_2$. It was argued in

* {#FreedHarveyMinasianMoore98} [[Dan Freed]], [[Jeff Harvey]], [[Ruben Minasian]], [[Greg Moore]], _Gravitational Anomaly Cancellation for M-Theory Fivebranes_, Adv.Theor.Math.Phys.2:601-618, 1998 ([arXiv:hep-th/9803205](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9803205))

* {#HarveyMinasianMoore98b} [[Jeff Harvey]], [[Ruben Minasian]], [[Greg Moore]], _Non-abelian Tensor-multiplet Anomalies_, JHEP9809:004, 1998 ([arXiv:hep-th/9808060](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9808060))

* {#BilalMetzger03} [[Adel Bilal]], Steffen Metzger, _Anomaly cancellation in M-theory: a critical review_, Nucl.Phys. B675 (2003) 416-446 ([arXiv:hep-th/0307152](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0307152))

that this term disappears (cancels) when properly taking into account the singularity of the [[supergravity C-field]] at the locus of the [[black brane|black]] [[M5-brane]].

A more transparent version of this argument was offered in

* {#Monnier13} Samuel Monnier, _Global gravitational anomaly cancellation for five-branes_, Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, Volume 19 (2015) 3 ([arXiv:1310.2250](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2250)) 

based on a refined discussion of the quantum anomaly of the [[self-dual higher gauge field]] on the M5-brane in 

* {#Monnier14a} Samuel Monnier, _The anomaly line bundle of the self-dual field theory_, Comm. Math. Phys. 325 (2014) 41-72 ([arXiv:1109.2904](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2904))

This formulation via an anomaly 12-form is (re-)derived also in

* {#BahBonettiMinasianNardoni18} Ibrahima Bah, Federico Bonetti, [[Ruben Minasian]], Emily Nardoni, _Class $\mathcal{S}$ Anomalies from M-theory Inflow_, Phys. Rev. D 99, 086020 (2019) ([arXiv:1812.04016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04016))

### Relation to D4-brane

### Nonabelian 2-form fields

* [[Edward Witten]], _Geometric Langlands From Six Dimensions_ ([arXiv:0905.2720](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2720))
