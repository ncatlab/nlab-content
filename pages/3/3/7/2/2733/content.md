[[!redirects M Set]]
If $M$ is a [[monoid]], then $M Set$ or $M&#8209;Set$ is the [[category]] of $M$-sets.  That is, an [[object]] of this category is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with an [[action]] of $M$ on $X$, and a [[morphism]] is an [[equivariant function]].

Don't confuse this with the [[MultiSet|category of multisets]].
