## Idea

The concept of [[tensor triangulated category]] may be thought of as a [[categorification]] of the concept of a [[ring]] in that the [[monoidal category]] structure refines the [[monoid]] structure of a ring, and the fact that it is a [[triangulated category]] and hence [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable]] makes it the [[homotopy theory]] analog of a monoid in [[abelian groups]], hence of a ring.

Accordingly, one may consider the [[prime spectrum]] of a tensor triangulated category in direct analogy: the [[prime ideals]] are taken to be the [[thick subcategories]] which behave as prime ideals under the [[tensor product]], in the obvious way.  ([Thomason 97](#Thomason97), [Balmer 02](#Balmer02)).

In terms of modern [[stable (∞,1)-category]] theory this may be understood as being the shadow on [[homotopy categories]] of the  _[[prime spectrum of a symmetric monoidal stable (∞,1)-category]]_.

A typical application of the spectrum construction for tensor triangulated categories is to the [[derived categories]] of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] of [[algebraic varieties]]. If one restricts to [[perfect complexes]] then often the variety may be reconstructed from the spectrum of its category of coherent sheaves. More generally this reconstruction theory applies to [[geometric stacks]], see at _[[Tannaka duality for geometric stacks]]_.

In some good cases such reconstruction works even when forgetting the monoidal structure ([Bondal-Orlov 03](#BondalOrlov03)):
The reconstruction theorems of nice classes of schemes from the abelian categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves have versions from weaker data of the corresponding derived categories, viewed as [[triangulated category|triangulated]] or [[enhanced triangulated categories]] (see [[triangulated categories of sheaves]]). This is important for study of deformations, [[homological mirror symmetry]] and noncommutative generalizations.

An important theorem of reconstruction using the triangulated category (but not the monoidal structure) is the [[Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem]]:

Several spectra for triangulated categories were systematically studied by Rosenberg:

* [[A. L. Rosenberg]], _Geometry of Noncommutative 'Spaces' and Schemes_, [pdf](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preblob/5148)

Along the lines of the general [[spectral cookbook]], these spectra are obtained considering certain preorders on objects of the triangulated category. The preorders can be easily modified to respect additional structure, say a monoidal product, if there. 


In this vein, Thomason, Balmer, Garkusha and others considered instead tensor triangulated categories and corresponding [[spectral theory]], as well as stronger reconstruction theorems of schemes from derived categories of coherent sheaves (or, in some cases, perfect complexes) taking into account the monoidal structures:
