### Idea

The reconstruction theorems of nice classes of schemes from the abelian categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves have versions from weaker data of the corresponding derived categories, viewed as [[triangulated category|triangulated]] or [[enhanced triangulated categories]] (see [[triangulated categories of sheaves]]). This is important for study of deformations, [[homological mirror symmetry]] and noncommutative generalizations.

### References

An important theorem of reconstruction using the triangulated category (but not the monoidal structure) is the [[Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem]]:

Several spectra for triangulated categories were systematically studied by Rosenberg:

* [[A. L. Rosenberg]], _Geometry of Noncommutative 'Spaces' and Schemes_, [pdf](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preblob/5148)

Along the lines of the general [[spectral cookbook]], these spectra are obtained considering certain preorders on objects of the triangulated category. The preorders can be easily modified to respect additional structure, say a monoidal product, if there. 

In this vein, Thomason, Balmer, Garkusha and others considered instead tensor triangulated categories and corresponding [[spectral theory]], as well as stronger reconstruction theorems of schemes from derived categories of coherent sheaves (or, in some cases, perfect complexes) taking into account the monoidal structures:
