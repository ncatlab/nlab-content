Algebraic topology is generally the study of [[functor]]s from [[nice categories of spaces]] to [[algebraic category|algebraic categories]].  This is in hindsight, in fact, [[category theory]] originally developed out of algebraic topology, where it was used first simply to describe what was going on and then to axiomatise [[Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology]] theories.
