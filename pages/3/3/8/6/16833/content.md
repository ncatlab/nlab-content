## Idea

In [[sheaf and topos theory]], given any [[small category]], its *trivial topology* is the [[coverage]] whose covering families are the [[identity morphisms]], hence the [[Grothendieck topology]] for which only the [[sieves]] generated by [[identity morphisms]] are [[covering]] (i.e. those containing every morphism with the given [[codomain]]). 


The [[sheaves]] for the trivial topology are precisely the [[presheaves]] on the [[underlying]] [[category]]. In this way every [[category of presheaves]] is realized as a [[category of sheaves]] and hence as a [[Grothendieck topos]].
