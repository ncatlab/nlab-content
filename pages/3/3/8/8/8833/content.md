## Idea

The _Massey product_ of length $n$ is a certain $n$-ary products on the [[cohomology ring]] of an [[A-infinity algebra]] (in particular a [[dg-algebra]]).

### In components

Roughly, Massey Products are to [[cohomology]] as [[Toda Brackets]] are to [[homotopy]].

Somewhat more fully, while Toda brackets are relations between mapping space groups $Map_* (\Sigma^n A_0, A_{n+2}) $ and chains of maps $ A_0 \to \cdots \to A_{n+2} $, and generalizing nullhomotopy of composition, Massey products are a relation between cohomology groups
$ H^{p_0 + \cdots + p_k - k + 1}(X) $ and $ H^{p_0} (X) \otimes \cdots \otimes H^{p_k}(X) $, generalizing the vanishing of pairwise [[cup product]]s.

The case $k=2$ is straight-forward enough: given three homogeneous classes $ [u],[v],[w] $ such that $ [u]\smile[v] = [v]\smile[w] = 0$, there are (various) choices of cochains $ s , t $ with $ d s = u \cdot v $ and $ d t = v \cdot w $.  The Massey triple product is the set of sums $ [ u \cdot t \pm s \cdot w ] $, 
where the sign is chosen for cocyclicity.

## Properties

### Relation to Steenrod squares
 {#RelationToSteenrodSquares}

Let $\omega, \omega_1, \omega_2 \in H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z}/2)$ such that their triple Massey product exists. 
Then the cup product of $\omega$ with the triple Massey product is independent of the ambiguity in the Massey products and equals the cup product of $\omega_1$ with $\omega_2$ and with the [[Steenrod square]] of $\omega$ of degree $deg(\omega)-1$:

$$
  \omega \cup
  \left\langle
    \omega_1, \omega, \omega_2
  \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \omega_1 \cup \omega_2 \cup Sq^{ deg(\omega) -1 }( \omega )
  \,.
$$

### Relation to $A_\infty$-algebra

For $A$ a [[dg-algebra]], its [[chain homology]] $H_\bullet(A)$ inherits an [[A-infinity algebra]] structure by [[Kadeishvili's theorem]]. Then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the $n$-ary $A_\infty$-product on elements $ (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in H_\bullet(A)^n$ is given, up to a sign, by the Massey product $\langle a_1, \cdots, a_n\rangle$. 

For $n = 3$ this is due to ([Stasheff](#Stasheff)). For general $n$  this appears as ([LPWZ, theorem 3.1](#LPWZ)).

Notice that the definition of Massey product on top of p.282 of [Valette-Loday](#ValetteLoday), $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ depends on choices of $a,b$ which don't appear in the notation. Then lemma 9.4.11 talks about a particular choice of $a,b$ which is made in the body of the proof. The actual statement of the lemma only can be deduced after reading the proof. It then says that for these particular choices of a,b the said equality holds. (See [this MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/92315/massey-products-vs-a-infty-structures)).
