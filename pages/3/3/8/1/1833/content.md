A notion of _pseudomodel stack_ was introduced by [[Nikolai Durov]] ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2030)) as a generalization of [[model stacks]], one which seems to be a more appropriate [[internalization]] of [[model categories]] in the setting of [[topoi]]. 

A [[stack]] $C$ over a [[site]] $S$ is a __pseudomodel stack__ if it is a [[flat stack]] and in every fiber five local classes of morphisms are distinguished: fibrations, acyclic fibrations, cofibrations, acyclic cofibrations and weak equivalences: and

(PM1) all fiber categories are [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]] and [[finitely cocomplete category|finitely cocomplete]],

(PM2) each distinguished class is local and stable under composition and global [[retracts]],

(PM3) (2-out-of-3) If $f$, $g$, $g\circ f$ are defined morphisms in a fixed fiber, then if any two of the three are weak equivalences then so is the third,

(PM5) (factorization) Any morphism can be globally factored as a cofibration followed by a fibration, where one can make either one chosen of the two acyclic, 

(PM8) any acyclic fibration is both a fibration and weak equivalence, and any acyclic cofibration is both a cofibration and a weak equivalence (but not necessarily other ways around); any weak equivalence can be factored as an acyclic cofibration folowed by an acyclic fibration.

There is no lifting axiom! But the axioms are still self-dual.

Each fiber of a pseudomodel stack is a [[pseudomodel category]] (in another way, it is a pseudomodel stack over the [[point]]).
