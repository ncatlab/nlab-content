A notion of pseudomodel stack is introduced by Nikolai Durov
([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/math/abs/0704.2030)) as a generalization of [[model stacks]] which seem to be more appropriate internalization of model categories in the setting of topoi. 

A stack $C$ over a site $S$ is a __pseudomodel stack__ if it is a flat stack and in every fiber five local classes of morphisms are distinguished: fibrations, acyclic fibrations, cofibrations,
acyclic cofibrations and weak equivalences and

(PM1) all fiber categories are closed under finite limits and colimits,

(PM2) each distinguished class is local and stable under composition and global retracts,

(PM3) (2-out-of-3) If $f$, $g$, $g\circ f$ are defined morphisms ina  fixed fiber than if any two of the three are weak equivalences then so is the third,

(PM5) (factorization) Any morphism can be globally factorized as a cofibration followed by a fibration, where any one can make any one chosen of the two acyclic, 

(PM8) any acyclic fibration is both a fibration and weak equivalence; any acyclic cofibration is both a cofibration and a weak equivalence (not necessarily other way around);
any weak equivalence can factorize as an acyclic cofibration folowed by an acyclic fibration.

There is no lifting axiom! But the axioms are still self-dual. Each fiber of a pseudomodel stack is a pseudomodel category (in other way it is a pseudomodel stack over a point).
