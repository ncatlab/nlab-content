## Idea

### Basic idea

The basic idea is that a _module_ $V$ is an object equipped with an [[action]] by a [[monoid]] $A$. This is closely related to the concept of a [[representation]] of a [[group]].

A familiar example of a module is a [[vector space]] $V$ over a [[field]] $k$: this is a _module_ over $k$ in the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups. But nothing in the definition of [[vector space]] really depends on the fact that $k$ here is a [[field]]: more generally it could be any [[ring]] $R$. The analog of a vector space for fields replaced by rings is that of a module over the ring $R$.



### More general perspectives

The notion of [[monoid]] in a [[monoidal category]] generalizes
directly to that of a monoid in a [[2-category]], where it is called a [[monad]]. Accordingly the notion of module generalizes to this more general case, where however it is called an _algebra over a monad_ . For more on this see [Modules for monoids in 2-categories: algebras over monads](#MonadAlgs) below.

Apart from this direct generalization, there are two distinct and separately important perspective on the notion of module from the [[nPOV]]:

* modules may usefully be thought of in the context of [[enriched category theory]] (and the enrichment may be over a [[2-category]]);

* modules may usefully be thought of in terms of [[abelian category|abelianization]]/[[stabilization]] of [[overcategory|overcategories]].

#### Modules for monoids in 2-categories: modules over monads {#MonadAlgs}

The notion of [[monoid]] generalizes straightforwardly from
monoids in a [[monoidal category]] to monoids in a [[2-category]]:
for the [[2-category]] [[Cat]], and more generally for arbitrary
2-categories, these are called [[monad]]s.

A [[module over a monad]] (see there for more details) is defined essentially exactly as that 
of module over a monoid. For historical reasons, a module over
a monad in [[Cat]] is called an _algebra over a monad_, because the algebras in the sense of [[universal algebra]] can be obtained as algebras/modules over a [[finitary monad]] in $Set$: the modules for a free algebra monad (for certain kind of algebras) on [[Set]], which are the composition of the free alegbra functor and its [[right adjoint]] forgetful functor are exactly algebras of that type. Modules over a fixed monad (in $Cat$) are the objects of the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of the monad; in arbitrary bicategory, this category generalized to Eilenberg-Moore objects which may or may not exist. 

#### Enriched presheaves

The [[action]] $\rho$ of a [[monoid]] $A$ in a [[monoidal category]] $V$ may be equivalently encoded in terms of a  $V$-[[enriched functor]] 
   
   $$
     \rho : \mathbf{B}A \to V
   $$ 

   from the [[delooping]] one-object $V$-[[enriched category]] $\mathbf{B}A$ corresponding to $A$ to $V$ itself. 

   This means that more generally it makes sense to replace $\mathbf{B}A$ by any $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$ -- regarded as the [[horizontal categorification]] of a monoid, a "monoid-oid" -- and think of $V$-enriched functors $\rho : C \to V$ -- $V$-[[presheaf|presheaves]] -- as modules for $C$. 

   From this perspective a $C$-$D$-[[bimodule]] is a $V$-[[enriched functor]] $C^{op}\times D \to V$, which is in this context known as a [[profunctor]] from $C$ to $D$. The notion of the [[bicategory]] $V Mod$ of $V$-enriched categories, $V$-profunctors between these and transformations between those is then a generalization of the 


#### Stabilized overcategories

A module $N$ over a (commutative, unital) ring $R$ may be encoded in another ring: the one that as an abelian group is the [[direct sum]] $R \oplus N$ and whose product is defined by the formulas

$$
  (r_1, n_1) \cdot (r_2,n_2) := (r_1 r_2, r_1 n_1 + r_2 n_2)
  \,.
$$

This is a **square-0 extension** of $R$. It is canonically equipped with a ring homomorphism $R \oplus N \to R$ which is the identity on $R$ and sends all elements of $N$ to 0. As such, $R \oplus N \to R$ is an object in the [[overcategory]] $CRing/R$. But a special such object: it is in fact canonically an abelian [[group object]] in $CRing/R$, where the group operation (over $R$!) is given by addition of elements in $N$.

From this perspective, it makes sense for general [[category|categories]] $C$ to think of the [[abelian category|abelianization]] of their [[overcategory|overcategories]] $C/A$ as categories of modules over the object $A$.

Taken all together, this makes the fiberwise [[abelian category|abelianization]] of their [[codomain fibration]] $cod : [I,C] \to C$ the category of all possible modules over all objects of $C$.

This general perspective has a nice [[vertical categorification]] to the context of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]: abelianization becomes [[stabilization]] in this context, and the fiberwise stabilization of the [[codomain fibration]] of any [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ is the [[tangent (∞,1)-category]] $T_C \to C$. 

For instance for $sAlg_k$ the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[simplicial ring|simplicial algebras]] over a ground field $k$ of characteristic 0, we have that the [[stabilization]] $Stab(sAlgk/A)$ of the [[over quasi-category|over (∞,1)-category]] over $A$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,1)$-category $A Mod$ of 
$A$-modules.


## Details 

We spell out details of the definition of module for 

* the classical case of modules over rings;

* the generalized case of modules as presheaves in enriched category theory;

* the generalized case of modules as objects in stabilized overcategories.

### Ordinary concept

A (right) module over a [[monoid]] $A$ [[internalization|internal to]] a [[monoidal category]] $(V, \otimes, I)$ is an object $N$ of $V$ equipped with a morphism

$$
  \rho : N \otimes A \to N
$$

in $C$ which satisfies the usual axioms of an [[action]].  

#### Example: Modules over rings {#Rings}

The category of all modules over commutative rings is [[Mod]]. It is a [[bifibration]]

$$
  Mod \to CRing
$$

over [[CRing]].

A [[ring]] is a [[monoid]] in [[Ab]]. Hence a module over a ring is first of all an [[object]] $N$ in [[Ab]], hence an abelian group. Moreover, it is equipped with a [[morphism]]

$$
  \alpha : R \otimes N \to N
$$ 

in [[Ab]]. On the left we have the [[tensor product]] of abelian groups. So this is a morphism that sends

$$
  (r,n ) \mapsto r n
$$

such that

$$
  (r, n_1 + n_2) \mapsto r n_1 + r n_2
$$

and

$$
  (r_1 + r_2, n) \mapsto r_1 n + r_2 n
  \,.
$$

Moreover, this morphism respects the monoid structure on $R$, in that the diagram

$$
  \array{
     R \otimes R \otimes N 
     &\stackrel{\cdot_R \otimes Id_N}{\to}& R \otimes N
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{Id_R \otimes \alpha}}\downarrow 
     && 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{alpha}}
     \\
     R \otimes N &\to& N 
  }
$$

commutes. In formulas this means that 

$$
  (r_1 \cdot r_2) n = r_1 (r_2 n)
  \,.
$$

Finally the unit axioms says that the identity element of $R$ acts as the identity on $N$.

Saying the same fully in terms of [[enriched category theory]]:

Write $\mathbf{B}R$ for the [[Ab-enriched category]] with a single object and $R = \mathbf{B}A(\bullet, \bullet)$.
A module $N$ is an $Ab$-functor 
$$   
  N : \mathbf{B}R \to Ab 
  \,.
$$

The category $R Mod$ has $R$-modules as objects and $R$-module homomorphisms as morphisms.  More abstractly, this is the [[Ab]]-[[enriched functor category]] $[\mathbf{B}R,Ab]$.


#### Example: $G$-sets {#GSets}

Classically the notion of module is always regarded internal to [[Ab]], so that a module is always an abelian group with extra structure. But noticing that such abelian ring modules are just enriched presheaves in [[Ab]]-[[enriched category theory]], it makes sense to consider enriched presheaves in general $V$-enriched category theory as a natural generalization of the notion of module.

For that generalization the case of [[Set]]-[[enriched category theory]] plays a special basic role:

a [[group]] $G$ (with no extra structre, i.e. just a [[set]] with group structure) is a monoid in [[Set]]. A module over $G$ in the sense of [[Set]]-[[enriched functor]] (just an ordinary [[functor]])

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \to Set
$$

is nothing but a **$G$-set**: a [[set]] equipped with a $G$-action:

$\mathbf{B}G$ is the [[small category]] that is the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] of $G$, which has a single object and $Hom_{\mathbf{B}G}(\bullet,\bullet) = G$. The functor $\mathbf{B}G \to Set$ takes the single object to some set $S$ and takes each morphism $(\bullet \stackrel{g}{\to} \bullet)$ to an [[automorphism]] $\rho(g) : S \to S$ of that set, such that composition is respected. This is just a [[representation]] of $G$ on the set $S$.

Of course for this story to work, $G$ need not be a group, but could be any [[monoid]].
 



### In enriched category theory

Equivalently, regarding the [[monoid]] $A$ as a one-object $V$-[[enriched category]] $\mathbf{B}A$, the module together with its action are given by a $V$-[[enriched functor]]

$$
  \rho : \mathbf{B}A \to V
  \,.
$$

Correspondingly, a _left_ module over $A$ is a functor

$$
  \rho : (\mathbf{B}A)^{\mathrm{op}} \to V
  \,.
$$

In this language the concept directly generalizes to the [[horizontal categorification]] of monoids $A$. Let $K$ be _any_ $V$-[[enriched category]], then $V$-functors
$
  \rho : K \to V
$
give right modules and functors
$
  \rho : K^{\mathrm{op}} \to V
$ give left modules over $K$. Accordingly, for $K$ and $L$ two $V$-enriched categories one says that $V$-functors

$$
  K^{op} \otimes L \to V
$$

are _$K$-$L$-[[bimodule]]s_, also known as _profunctors_ or _[[distributor]]s_ from $K$ to $L$.



### In terms of stabilized overcategories {#DefWithOCat}

The ordinary case of modules over rings is phrased 
in terms of stabilized overcategories by the following
observation, wich apparently goes back to Quillen.

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $R \in CRing$ be a commutative [[ring]]. Then there is a canonical [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the [[category]] $R Mod$ of $R$-modules and the category $Ab(CRing/R)$ of abelian [[group object]]s in the [[overcategory]] of $CRing$ over $R$

$$
  R Mod \simeq Ab(CRing/R)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Unwind the structure encoded in an abelian group object
$(p:  K \to R)$ in the overcaregory $CRing/R$.

The unit of the abelian group object in $CRing/R$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
     R &&\to&& K
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{Id}}\searrow && \swarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     && R
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram identifies $K$ with a ring of the form $R \oplus ker(p)$ in which for $r \in R$ and $n \in ker(p)$ we have $r\cdot n \in ker(p)$. 

The [[product]] of $R \oplus N \to R$ with itself in the [[overcategory]] is the [[fiber product]] over $R$ in the original category, hence is $R \oplus N \oplus N$.

The addition operation on the abelian group object is therefore a morphism

$$
  \array{
    R \oplus N \oplus N &&\to&& R \oplus N
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && R
  }
  \,.
$$

With the above unit, the unit axiom on this operation says that this morphism is 

$$
    R \oplus N \oplus N \stackrel{Id \oplus (Id + Id)}{\to}
    R \oplus N
  \,.
$$

Since the ring product in the direct product ring $R \oplus N \oplus N$ between two elements in the two copies of $N$ vanishes, it therefore has to vanish between two elements in the same copy, too. 

This says that $R \oplus N$ is a square-0 extension of $R$. Conversely, for every square-0-extension we obtain an abelian group object this way.

=--

For instance the square-0-extension of a ring $R$ corresponding to the canonical $R$-module structure on $R$ itself is the [[ring of dual numbers]] for $R$. 


#### Example: Modules over simplicial rings {#SimpRings}

Let $sAlg_k$ (or $sAlg$ for short) be the [[(∞,1)-category]] of commutative [[simplicial ring|simplicial algebras]] over a base field $k$. 

For $A \in sAlg_k$ there is generally a functor

$$
  A Mod \to Stab(sAlg_k/A)
$$

from the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of $A$-modules to the [[stabilization]] of the [[overcategory]] of $sAlg$. But in general this functor is neither [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] nor [[full functor|full]]. If however $k$ has characteristic 0, then this is an equivalence.

### Modules over higher and generalized algebras

There is a notion of [[algebra over an operad]]. The corresponding notion of modules is described at [[module over an algebra over an operad]].

### Vector bundles and sheaves of modules

A [[vector space]] is a [[vector bundle]] over the [[point]]. For every [[vector bundle]] $E \to X$ over a [[space]] $X$, its collection $\Gamma(E)$ of [[section]]s is a module over the monoid/ring of functions on $X$. When $X$ is a [[ringed space]], $\Gamma(X)$ is usefully thought of as a [[sheaf]] of modules over the [[structure sheaf]] of $X$:

For describing vector bundles and their generalization it turns out that this perspective of encoding them in terms of their modules of sections is useful. For instance the category of vector bundles on a space typically fails to be an [[abelian category]]. But if instead of looking just as sheaves of modules on $X$ that arise as sections of vector bundles one generalizes to [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves of modules]] then one obtains an abelian category, something like the completion of $Vect(X)$ to an abelian category. If one further demands that the category be closed under push-forward operations, such as to obtain a [[bifibration]] of generalized vctor bundles over spaces, one arrives at the notion of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves of modules]] over the [[structure sheaf]].

But it turns out that the category of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] over a test space (see there for details) is equivalent simply to the category of _all_ modules over the (functions on) this test space. This means that quasicoherent sheaves of modules have a nice description in terms of the general-abstract-nonsense characterization of modules discussed above:

For $C$ our [[(∞,1)-category]] of of test [[space]]s (hence the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ our [[(∞,1)-category]] of "functions rings" on test spaces), by the above the assignment of all modules over a test space is given by

$$
  Mod : C^{op} \to (\infty,1)Cat
$$

$$
  Mod : U \mapsto Stab( C/U )
  \,.
$$

Then for $X$ any [[space]] regarded as an [[∞-stack]] on $C$, a "quasicorent $\infty$-stack of modules" on $X$ is a morphism 

$$
  X \to Mod
  \,.
$$

By the above discussion, this procedure yieelds the expected notions of modules in particular for the choice $C = (sAlg_k)^{op}$ of simplicial algebras over a ground ring of characteristic 0. The theory of quasicoherent sheaves of modules in this case is discussed in great detail at [[geometric ∞-function theory]]. Some more general remarks along these lines are at [[schreiber:∞-vector bundle]].
