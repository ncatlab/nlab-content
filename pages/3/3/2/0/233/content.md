If we think of a [[ring]] $R$ is a one-object category [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Ab]], a module $M$ of $R$ is a functor 
$$   M: R \to Ab $$
enriched over $Ab$.

Don't panic: this definition is equivalent to [the one you're used to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_mathematics#Formal_definition).

The category $R Mod$ has $R$-modules as objects and $R$-module homomorphisms as morphisms.  More abstractly, this is the [[enriched category|enriched]] [[functor category]] $Ab^R$.  

(It's possible that exponential notation is bad for an enriched functor category; maybe $hom(R,Ab)$ is better.)

[[Eric Forgy|Eric]]: The wikipedia page distinguishes left $R$-modules as covariant functors and right $R$-modules as contravariant functors. Is that distinction important?
