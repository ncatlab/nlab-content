This entry is about the book

* [[John Gray]], 

  _Formal category theory: adjointness for $2$-categories_

  Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 391. 

  Springer-Verlag, Berlin-New York, 1974. xii+282 pp. 

  [doi:10.1007/BFb0061280](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0061280)

on [[formal category theory]], which is [[category theory]] formulated "formally" via the [[2-category theory]] of the [[2-category]] [[Cat]] of all categories.

This is one of the most influential and comprehensive historical books in low-dimensional [[higher category theory]], following the spirit of:

* {#Law66} [[William Lawvere]], *The Category of Categories as a Foundation for Mathematics*, pp. 1-20 in: [[John W. Gray]], *Fibred and Cofibred Categories*, in: [[Samuel Eilenberg|S. Eilenberg]], [[D. K. Harrison]], [[S. MacLane]], [[H. Röhrl]] (eds.): *[[Proceedings of the Conference on Categorical Algebra - La Jolla 1965]]*, Springer (1966) &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/978-3-642-99902-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-99902-4)&rbrack;


More recently, this approach is echoed in [Riehl & Verity 13](homotopy+2-category+of+infinity-categories#RiehlVerity13), where [[Cat]] is enhanced to the [[homotopy 2-category of (∞,1)-categories]] in order to provide [[2-category theory|2-category theoretic]] foundations for [[(∞,1)-category theory]]. At least for [[presentable (infinity,1)-categories|presentable $\infty$-categories]], this is also obtained as the [[2-localization]] of the 2-category of [[combinatorial model categories]] and [[left Quillen functors]] at the [[Quillen equivalences]]: see at *[[2Ho(CombModCat)]]]*.

The book was supposed to be the first part of a four volume work, but unfortunately later volumes/chapters never appeared. It has some parts of 2- and 3-category theory; including the treatment of the famous [[Gray tensor product]] on 2-Cat. See also [[Gray-category]].

Unfortunately, due to changes in terminology, the book may be difficult to read nowadays.  Gray uses prefixes such as 'quasi,' 'iso,' and 'weak' to indicate various levels of weakness, but his choice of terminology is not entirely consistent, can be confusing, and is completely different from the standard modern terminology which uses 'lax,' 'oplax,' and 'pseudo' with (mostly) precise and consistent meanings.

The following is a list of some of the definitions given in the book,
along with their modern names and links to nLab entries.

* Section 2

  * _2-category_ (see [[strict 2-category]])
  * _2-functor/$Cat$-functor_ (i.e. [[strict 2-functor]])
  * _Cat-natural transformation_ (see [[enriched functor category]])
  * _Quasi-natural transformation_ ([[lax natural transformation]])
  * [[modification|Modification]]
  * [[2-comma category]]
  * [[double category|Double category]]

* Section 3
  * [[bicategory|Bicategory]]
  * _Pseudo-functor_ ([[lax 2-functor]]), _homomorphic pseudo-functor_
  ([[pseudofunctor]]), _strict pseudo-functor_ (= strict 2-functor -- see [[enriched functor]])

* Section 4

  * $Fun(A,B)$ and $Pseud(A,B)$ (see [[Gray tensor product]])

* Section 6
  * _Adjoint morphisms_ in a 2-category ([[adjunction]])
  * [[Kan extension]] in a 2-category

* Section 7

  * _Transcendental quasi-adjunction_ ([[lax 2-adjunction]])
