Given a [[closed immersion of schemes]] $f= (f,f^\sharp): (Y,O_Y)\to (X,O_X)$ of (or of more general [[locally ringed spaces]], e.g. of analytic varieties), the kernel $\mathcal{I} = O_X$ of the comorphism $f^\sharp:O_Y\to f_* O_X$ is a sheaf of ideals, called the [[defining sheaf]] of the closed immersion $f$. 

The __conormal sheaf__ is the quotient sheaf $\Omega_{X/Y} = \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$. In algebraic setting, it is also called the sheaf of relative [[Kähler differentials]]. 

One sometimes says [[conormal bundle]] meaning conormal sheaf, though the bundle and sheaf are two points of view in the cases when the conormal sheaf is locally free of constant rank.
