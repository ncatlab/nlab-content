#Idea#

_Extended quantum field theory_ (or _many-tiered quantum field theory_) is the [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]]:

whereas 

* [[category theory|1-categorical]] [[TQFT]] may be regarded as a rule that allows to compute topological invariants $Z(\Sigma)$ assigned to $n$-dimensional [[manifold]]s by cutting these manifolds into a sequence $\{\Sigma_i\}$ of $n$-dimensional composable [[cobordism]]s with $(n-1)$-dimensional boundaries $\partial \Sigma_i$, e.g.  $\Sigma = \Sigma_2 \coprod_{\partial \Sigma_1 = \partial \Sigma_2} \Sigma_1$, then assigning quantities $Z(\Sigma_i)$ to each of these and then composing these quantities in some way, e.g. as $Z(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma_2)\circ Z(\Sigma_1)$;

we have that

* in extended [[TQFT]] $Z(\Sigma)$ may be computed by decomposing $\Sigma$ into pieces of arbitrary codimension $d$, i.e. into $(n-d)$-dimensional pieces.

For that reason extended QFT is also sometimes called **local** or **localized** QFT. In fact, the notion of locality in [[quantum field theory]] is precisely this notion of locality. And, as also discussed at [[FQFT]], this higher dimensional version of locality is naturally encoded in terms of [[higher category theory|n-functoriality]] of $Z$ regarded as a functor on a [[higher category theory|higher category]] of [[cobordism]]s.

#The category of extended cobordisms#

The definition of a $j$-cobordism is recursive. A $(j+1)$-cobordism between $j$-cobordisms is a [[compact space|compact]] [[orientation|oriented]] $(j+1)$-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] with corners whose the boundary is the [[disjoint union]] of the target $j$-cobordism and the orientation reversal of the source $j$-cobordism.  (The base case of the recursion is the [[empty set]], thought of as a $(-1)$-dimensional manifold.)

$n Cob_m$ is an $n$-category with smooth compact oriented $n$-manifolds as objects and cobordisms of cobordisms up to $m$-cobordisms, up to diffeomorphism, as morphisms.

There are various suggestions with more or less detail for a precise definition of a higher category $n Cob_n$ of fully extended $n$-dimensional cobordisms. 

A very general one is described at [[(âˆž,n)-category of cobordisms]].

See 

* [[extended cobordism]].


#Definition#

Fix a [[base ring]] $R$, and let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] $n$-category.

An $m$-extended $C$-valued TQFT of dimension $n$ is a symmetric $n$-tensor functor $Z: n Cob_m \rightarrow C$ that maps
* smooth compact oriented $n$-manifolds to elements of $R$
* smooth compact oriented $(n-1)$-manifolds to $R$-modules
* cobordisms of smooth compact oriented $(n-1)$-manifolds to $R$-linear maps between $R$-modules
* smooth compact oriented $(n-2)$-manifolds to $R$-linear [[additive categories]]
* cobordisms of smooth compact oriented $(n-2)$-manifolds to functors between $R$-linear categories
* etc ...
* smooth compact oriented $0$-manifolds to $R$-linear $(m-2)$-categories
* cobordisms of smooth compact oriented $0$-manifolds to $(m-2)$-functors between $R$-linear $(m-2)$-categories

I changed references to bordism here into references to [[cobordisms]], since there\'s also a notion of bordism (a back-formation) as dual to cobordism, which is not what we want.  (Also Wikipedia implies that 'bordism' is a mass noun while 'cobordism' is a count noun, and these are count nouns, for what that\'s worth.)  ---Toby

with compatibility conditions and gluing formulas that must be satisfied ...

Here $m$ can range between $2$ and $n+1$.

This suggests that one can see ETQFTs as $C$-valued representations of $n Cob_m$.

_Rafael_: I obviously used a linear category in the definition as C instead of a general C. Do anyone know how to generalize it? Neither do i know the compatibility conditions and gluing formulas, any good explicit references?

#Examples#

$m=2$ gives ordinary [[TQFT]].

The most common case is when $R = \mathbb{C}$ (the [[complex numbers]]), giving unitary ETQFT.

The most common cases for $C$ are
*  $C = n Hilb(R)$, the category of $n$-[[n-Hilbert space|Hilbert spaces]] over a topological field $R$. As far as we know this is only defined up to $n=2$.
*  $C = n Vect(R)$, the category of $n$-[[n-vector space|vector spaces]] over a field $R$.
*  $C = n Mod(R)$, the (conjectured?) category of $n$-[[n-module|modules]] over a commutative ring $R$.

#Construction of ETQFT's#

* By generators and relations

* By path integrals (this is Daniel Freed's approach)

* By modular tensor n-categories?

#Classification of ETQFT's#

#Relation of ETQFT to AQFT#

_Rafael_: I am very tired because it is very late.
Please check and expand this page, i am not counting very good with my eyes half closed neither am i an expert on ETQFT.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: notice that I had a bit on extended QFT over at [[FQFT]]. Maybe some of the material needs to be merged. i have now at least added links back and forth.

_Rafael_: Yes, for the merge. I think of a subsection here **construction of ETQFTs** and a pointer to the relation between ETQFT to AQFT. I also think you are much better to include the construction of ETQFTs in **Nonabelian cocycles and their sigma model QFTs** than me.
