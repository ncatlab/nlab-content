#Idea#

Spaces can be characterized by their [[algebra|algebras]] of functions. Using this [[duality]] between [[space and quantity]] one can define generalized spaces in terms of generalizations of their algebras of functions.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to encode everything about the geometry of a space algebraically and then allow all commutative function algebras to be generalized to possibly non-commutative algebras. 

More generally, noncommutative geometry means replacing the space by some structure carried by an entity living on that would-be space.
The entity may be for example a function, vector bundle, coherent sheaf, a complex of sheaves and KK-theory class. Objects organize into associative algebras, operator algebras,
categories, higher categories and so on. [[reconstruction|Reconstruction]] theorems say that can reconstruct a genuine (say topological) "underlying" space.  Spectral theories are procedures (sometimes functors, often not) which recover some form of underlying space called [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]], often just partially or under strong assumptions.
