#Idea#

Spaces can be characterized by their [[algebra]]s of functions. Using this [[duality]] between [[space and quantity]] one can define generalized spaces in terms of generalizations of their algebras of functions.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to encode everything about the geometry of a space algebraically and then allow all commutative function algebras to be generalized to possible non-commutative algebras.
