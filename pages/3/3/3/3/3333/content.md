## Idea

In an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ with $(\infty,1)$-[[pullback]]s, the _free loop space object_ $\mathcal{L}X$ of any object $X$ is an object that behaves as if its [[generalized element]]s are loops in $X$, morphisms between generalized elements [[homotopy|homotopies]] of loops, and so on.

For the case that $C = $ [[Top]] this reproduces the ordinary notion of free [[loop space]] objects of [[topological space]]s.

Over each fixed element $x \in X$, the free loop space object $\mathcal{L}X$ looks like the based [[loop space object]] $\Omega_x X$ of $X$.

Free loop space objects come naturally equipped with various structures of interest, such as a categorical circle action. The [[cohomology]] of $\mathcal{L}X$ is [[Hochschild cohomology]] or [[cyclic cohomology]] of function algebras $C(X)$ on $X$. The categorical circle action induces [[differential]]s on these cohomolgies, identifying them, in suitable cases, with algebras of [[Kähler differential|Kähler]] [[differential form]]s on $X$.


## Definition

### Intrinsic $(\infty,1)$-categorical definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

In an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$, for $X \in C$ an [[object]], its **free loop space object** $\mathcal{L}X$ is the $(\infty,1)$-[[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{L} X &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,Id)}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{(Id,Id)}{\to}& X \times X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

This is the $(\infty,1)$-categorical [[span trace]] of the identity-[[span]]

$$
  \mathcal{L}X =
  Tr
  \left(
    \array{
       && X
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{Id}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{Id}}
       \\
       X &&&& X
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$


### Models by homotopy pullbacks {#HomPullModel}

To see what this amounts to in more detail, assume that the [[(∞,1)-category]] is modeled by a [[homotopical category]], say for simplicity a [[category of fibrant objects]], for instance the full subcategory on fibrant objects of a [[model category]]. 

Then following the discussion at [[homotopy pullback]] and [[generalized universal bundle]] we can compute the about $(\infty,1)$-pullback as the ordinary [[limit]] 

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{L}X &\to& &\to& X
     \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,Id)}}
    \\
    && (X \times X)^I &\stackrel{(d_0,d_0)}{\to}& X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow &&  {}^{\mathllap{(d_1,d_1)}}\downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{(Id,Id)}{\to} &  X \times X
    \,,
  }
$$

where $(X\times X)^I$ is a [[path space object]] for $X \times X$.  At least if we have the structure of a [[model category]] we may take $(X \times X)^I = X^I \times X^I$ for a [[path space object]] $X^I$ of $X$. 

From this description one sees that $\mathcal{L}X$ is built from _pairs of paths_ in $X$ with coinciding endpoints, that are _glued at their coinciding endpoint_ . So the loops here are all built from two semi-ciricle paths.


## Properties

### Relation to based loop space object

The fiber of $\mathcal{L}X$ over a [[point]] $x : {*} \to X$ is the corresponding (based) [[loop space object]] $\Omega_x X$ of $X$: we have an $(\infty,1)$-[[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    \Omega_x X &\to& \mathcal{L}X &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,Id)}} 
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{x}{\to} & X &\stackrel{(Id,Id)}{\to}& X\times X
  }
  \,.
$$

To see this, use that [[homotopy pullback]]s paste to homotopy pullbacks, so that the outer pullback is modeled by the ordinary [[limit]]

$$
  \array{
    \Omega_x^{I \vee I}X &\to& &\to& X
     \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,Id)}}
    \\
    && (X \times X)^I &\stackrel{(d_0,d_0)}{\to}& X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow &&  {}^{\mathllap{(d_1,d_1)}}\downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{(x,x))}{\to} &  X \times X
    \,,
  }
$$

which builds based loops on $X$ from two consecutive paths, the first starting at the basepoint $x$, the second ending there. This is weakly equivalent $\Omega_x X = \Omega^I_x X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Omega^{I \vee I} X$ to the based [[loop space object]] $\Omega_x X$ built from just the path space object $X^I$ with a single copy of $I$, by standard arguments as for instance form page 12 on in

### Categorical circle action

If in addition $C$ has $(\infty,1)$-[[pushout]]s, then a [[point]] $x : {*} \to \mathcal{L}X$ of the free loop space object is (by definition of limit) the same thing as a map from the [[pushout]]   

$$
  S^1_{C} := \lim_\to \left( 
   {*} \leftarrow {*}\coprod{*}\to{*} \right)
  \,
$$
to $X$. A map $S^1_C \to X$ out of this is, by the nature of [[homotopy pullback|homotopy pushout]]s, two points $x_1 , x_2 : {*} \to X$ and two(!) homotopies 

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    & \nearrow \searrow^{\simeq}
    \\
    x_1 && x_2
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\simeq}
  }
  \right)
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \in C
$$

which may be thought of as forming a circle. So $S^1_C$ behaves like a cellular model for the circle with two vertices and two semi-circles. Compare this to the discussion of the nature of $\mathcal{L}X$ [above](#HomPullModel).
This is isomorphic to ${*}//\mathbb{Z}$, i.e., the [[classifying space]]/[[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$ in $C$. 

Since in [[Top]] all these objects are represented by $S^1$, it is reasonable to call them the **circle object** of the $(\infty,1)$-category $C$. Using the [[Yoneda lemma for (∞,1)-categories]] this means that the free loop space $\mathcal{L}X$ represents the [[(∞,1)-presheaf]]

$$
  Maps_C(S^1_{C},X) : U \mapsto C(S^1_C \times U, X)
$$

on $C$. The natural [[action]] of the monoid $End_C(S^1_{C})$ on $S^1_{C}$ itself induces an action 
$$
  End_C(S^1_{C}) \times Maps_C(S^1_{C},X) \to Maps_C(S^1_{C},X)
$$
and, assuming $C$ is closed, again by Yoneda this gives an action
$$
  End_C(S^1_{C}) \times \mathcal{L}X \to \mathcal{L}X.
$$
Since the action of $End_C(S^1_{C})$ on $\mathcal{L}X$ is just precomposition with a morphism, one sees that if $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism in $C$, then the induced morphism $\mathcal{L}f:\mathcal{L}X\to\mathcal{L}Y$ is $End_C(S^1_{C})$-equivariant.

Restriction to the subgroup $Aut_{0,C}(S^1_C)\subseteq End_C(S^1_{C})$ consisting of automorphisms of $S^1_C$ homotopy equivalent to the identity, gives the **categorical circle action**
$$
  Aut_{0,C}(S^1_C) \times \mathcal{L}X \to \mathcal{L}X
$$
on $\mathcal{L}X$. When $C=$ [[Top]] this action is the usual _rotation of the loops_ in $X$; indeed, the connected component of the identity in the group of topological automorphisms of $S^1$ is homotopically equivalent to the subgroup of rigid rotations.


#### Details {#DetailsCircAct}

Here is what this categorical circle action looks like in more detail:


> [[Urs Schreiber]]: not clear yet how useful the following is for the above...

we use the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$ of the additive [[group]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers for simplicity, as a model for $S^1_C$. The [[endomorphism]]s of this object form the category
$$
  END(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z})
$$

whose objects are functors $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$ and whose morphisms are [[natural transformation]]s between these. The functors come from group homomorphisms, hence from multiplication by $n\in\mathbb{Z}$

$$
  [n] : \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
$$

$$
  (\bullet \stackrel{k}{\to} \bullet) \mapsto (\bullet \stackrel{n\cdot k}{\to} \bullet).
$$

Natural transformations between two such automorphisms are given by a component $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that all diagrams

$$
  \array{
    \bullet &\stackrel{\ell}{\to}& \bullet
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{n\cdot k}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{n' \cdot k}}
    \\
    \bullet &\stackrel{\ell}{\to}& \bullet    
  }
$$

commute in $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$. This can happen only for $n = n'$, but then it happens for arbitrary $\ell$. In other words we have

$$
  END(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \coprod_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$
and 
$$
AUT_0(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The object $[n]$ corresponds to the self-mapping of the circle onto itself that fixes the basepoint and has winding number $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. The transformation $\ell$ corresponds then to a rigid rotation of the loop by $\ell$ full circles

Notably for $n = 1$ and $k = 1$ we may think of the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \bullet &\stackrel{\ell}{\to}& \bullet
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{1}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{1}}
    \\
    \bullet &\stackrel{\ell}{\to}& \bullet    
  }
$$

as depicting the unit loop around the circle (on the left, say) and the result of translating its basepoint $\ell$-times around the circle (the rest of the diagram). Of course since we are using a model of $S^1_C$ with a single object here, every rotation of the loop is a full circle rotation, which is a bit hard to see.

> Exercise: spell out the above discussion analogously for the equivalent model given by the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(S^1)$ of the standard circle. The is the groupoid with $S^1_{Top}$ as its set of objects homotopy classes of paths in the circle as morphisms. In this model things look more like one might expect from a circle action. Notice that $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[skeleton]] of $\Pi_1(S^1)$.

+--{: .query}
[[David Roberts]]: I presume that the 2-categories of groupoids and 1-types are equivalent (for the latter I'm taking a subcategory of the usual 2-category of CW complexes, with classes of homotopies as 2-arrows), giving us the conjectural result that the 2-group $AUT(\Pi_1(S^1))$ should be equivalent to the 2-group $AUT_{Ho}(S^1)$ with objects the self-homotopy equivalences of $S^1$ and morphisms the (homotopy classes of) homotopies between them. At the very least, without the above equivalence of 2-categories there should be a faithful functor $AUT_{Ho}(S^1) \to AUT(\Pi_1(S^1))$ which is also injective on objects. A simple exercise should show that it is full. 

[[Urs Schreiber]]: yes, certainly, these should be equivalent. The entire discussion is maybe a bit of an exercise in "the obvious made explicit to the point that it becomes non-obvious".

=--

Consider for instance $X = \mathbf{B}G$ such that $\mathcal{L}X = G//_{Ad}G$ (as discussed in detail below). Then a morphism $(g \stackrel{h}{\to} Ad_h a)$ in $G//G$ corresponds to a natural transformation

$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
    &\Downarrow^{h}&
    \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{Ad_h g}}
  }
  \,.
$$

Precomposing this with the automorphism $\ell$ of the object $[n]$ in $END(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z})$

$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{n}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
    &\Downarrow^{\ell}&
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{n}}
  }
$$

produces the new transformation

$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{n}} && \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
    &\Downarrow^{\ell}&
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}
    &\Downarrow^{h}&
    \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{n}} && \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{Ad_h g}}
  }
  \,.
$$

By the rules of horizontal composition of [[natural transformation]]s, this is the transformation whose component naturality square on $(\bullet \stackrel{1}{\to} \bullet)$ in $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$ is the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \bullet &\stackrel{g^\ell}{\to}& \bullet &\stackrel{h}{\to}&\bullet
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g^{n}}}\downarrow && {}^{g^n}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Ad_h g^n}}
   \\
    \bullet &\underset{g^\ell}{\to}& \bullet &\underset{h}{\to}&\bullet
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}$, hence the morphism $(g^n \stackrel{g^{\ell} h}{\to} Ad_h g^n)$ in $G//_{Ad}G$. In particular, the categorical circle action is 
$$
\ell:(g \stackrel{h}{\to} Ad_h g)\mapsto (g \stackrel{g^{\ell} h}{\to} Ad_h g).
$$ 



### Hochschild cohomology and cyclic cohomology

[[quasicoherent ∞-stack]]s on $\mathcal{L}X$ form the [[Hochschild cohomology|Hochschild homology]] object of $X$ (if the axioms of [[geometric function theory]] are met) as described there. The circle acton on $\mathcal{L}X$ induces differentials on these.

> ... details to be written, but see [[Hochschild cohomology]] and [[cyclic cohomology]] for more.




## Examples 

### Free topological loop spaces

* From the above [[limit]] description we see that in [[Top]] this yields a version for the ordinary free loop space of a [[topological space]].


### Details for $\mathcal{L} \mathbf{B}G$

Let the ambient [[(∞,1)-category]] be [[∞Grpd]], let $G$ be an ordinary [[group]] and $\mathbf{B}G$ its one-object [[delooping]] [[groupoid]]. 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

We have 

$$
  \mathcal{L} \mathbf{B}G \simeq G//_{Ad} G
  \,,
$$

the [[action groupoid]] of the adjoint action of $G$ on itself.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We spell this out in full pedestrian detail, as a little exercise in computing [[homotopy pullback]]s.

We have that the [[path space object]] is $\mathbf{B}G^I = [I,\mathbf{B}G]$ -- the [[functor category|functor groupoid]], where $I$ is the free groupoid $I = \{a \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} b\}$ on the standard [[interval object]] -- which is (by the definition of [[natural transformation]]) the [[action groupoid]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}G^I = G\backslash \backslash G // G
$$

for the action of $G$ on itself, by _inverse_ left and direct right multiplication separately: the naturality square of a [[natural transformation]] defining a morphism $g \stackrel{h_1,h_2}{\to} h_1^{-1} g h_2$ in this groupoid is the commuting square

$$
  \array{
    \bullet &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \bullet
    \\  
    {}^{\mathllap{h_1}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_2}}
    \\
    \bullet &\stackrel{h_1^{-1}g h_2}{\to}& \bullet    
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{B}G = {*}//G$.

The [[pullback]] of the top right corner of the above defining limit diagram is

$$
  \array{
    (G\backslash\backslash G \times 
    G\backslash\backslash G)//G
    &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,Id)}} 
    \\
    (G\backslash\backslash G//G) \times
    (G\backslash\backslash G//G)
    &\to& \mathbf{B}G \times \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

identifying the two actions from the right, and then the remaining pullback completing the limit diagram is

$$
  \array{
    G\backslash\backslash (G\times G)//G
    &\to& 
    (G\backslash\backslash G \times 
    G\backslash\backslash G)//G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{(Id,Id)}{\to}&  
    \mathbf{B}G \times \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

now identifying also the two actions from the left, so that  $G\backslash\backslash (G\times G)//G$ is the [[action groupoid]] of $G$ acting diagonally on $G \times G$ by multiplication from the left and from the right, separately.

To see better what this is, we pass to an equivalent smaller groupoid (the [[homotopy pullback]] is defined, of course, only up to weak equivalence). Notice that every morphism 
$(g_1,g_2) \stackrel{h_1,h_2}{\to} (g'_1, g'_2)$ 
in $G\backslash\backslash (G\times G)//G$ corresponding to a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \array{
     \bullet &\stackrel{(g_1,g_2)}{\to}& \bullet
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(h_1,h_1)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(h_2,h_2)}}
     \\
     \bullet &\stackrel{(h_1^{-1} g_1 h_2, h_1^{-1} g_2 h_2)}{\to}
     & \bullet
  }
$$

between functors $I\times I \to \mathbf{B}G \times \mathbf{B}G$
may always be decomposed as

$$
  \array{
     \bullet &\stackrel{(g_1,g_2)}{\to}& \bullet
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(e,e)}}\downarrow 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(g_2^{-1}, g_2^{-1})}}
     \\
     \bullet &\stackrel{(g_1 g_2^{-1}, e)}{\to}& \bullet
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(h_1,h_1)}}\downarrow 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(h_1,h_1)}}
     \\
     \bullet &\stackrel{(h_1^{-1}(g_1 g_2^{-1})h_1, e)}{\to}& \bullet
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(e,e)}}\downarrow 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(g'_2,g'_2)}}
     \\
     \bullet &\stackrel{(h_1^{-1}(g_1 g_2^{-1})h_1 g'_2, g'_2)}{\to}& \bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

Staring at this for a moment shows that this is a unique factorization of every morphism through one of the form

$$
  \array{
    \bullet & \stackrel{(g,e)}{\to} & \bullet
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{k}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}
    \\
    \bullet & \stackrel{(Ad_k g,e)}{\to} & \bullet    
  }
  \,,
$$

which is naturally identified with a morphism in the [[action groupoid]] $G//_{Ad} G$ of the adjoint action of $G$ on itself.

This means that the inclusion

$$
  G//_{Ad} G 
  \stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow}
  G\backslash\backslash(G \times G)//G
$$

given by this identification
is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]], and hence an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence of groupoids]].

So in conclusion we have that the free loop space object of the [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of a group is

$$
  \mathcal{L} \mathbf{B}G \simeq G//_{Ad}G
  \,.
$$

=--

### Chern character

We describe how the [[Chern character]] of [[vector bundle]]s over $X$ may be realized in terms of the [[cohomology]] of the free loop space object $\mathcal{L}X$.

Assume now $C$ is a nice category of smooth spaces, and let $X$ be an object of $C$.

Consider a [[group object]] $G$ in $C$ and a [[representation]] of $G$ given my a group homomorphism to the [[general linear group]] (in $C$):  $\rho:G\to GL(n;\mathbb{C})$. For instance $G$ could be $GL(n)$ itself and this morphism the identity.

The [[trace]] of the representation $\rho$ is invariant under conjugation in the group and so defnes a map $Tr(\rho): G//_{Ad}G\to \mathbb {C}$ -- a [[class function]]. By the equivalence $\mathcal{L}\mathbf{B}G \simeq G//_{Ad} G$ discussed above, this may be regarded as a [[characteristic class]]

$$
  Tr(\rho(-)) : \mathcal{L}\mathbf{B}G\to \mathbb {C}
$$

on the free loop space of $\mathbf{B}G$.

The [[cocycle]] $g : X\to \mathbf{B}G$ of a $G$-[[principal bundle]] on $X$ transgresses to a cocycle 

$$
  \mathcal{L} g : \mathcal{L}X \to \mathcal{L}\mathbf{B}G
$$

on the free loop space, by the functoriality of the free loop space object construction.

The above [[characteristic class]] of this cocycle is the composite morphism

$$
  Tr(\rho(\mathcal{L}g)) : \mathcal{L}X \to \mathcal{L} \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbb{C}
  \,,
$$

which by the $Ad$-invariance of the [[trace]] is now $S^1$-invariant and hence defines an element in the [[cyclic cohomology]]
$C(\mathcal{L}X,\mathbb{C})^{S^1_C}$ of $X$. 

The Hom-space $C(\mathcal{L}X,\mathbb{C})$ is a model for the graded commutative algebra of complex-valued [[differential form]]s on $X$, with the categorical circle action corresponding to the [[de Rham complex|de Rham differential]]. Hence $C(\mathcal{L}X,\mathbb{C})^{S^1_C}$ is a model for closed forms and maps to [[de Rham cohomology]] $H_{dR}^\bullet(X)$ of $X$. If the [[de Rham theorem]] holds for $X$ in $C$, then this may be identified with the real cohomology $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{R})$.



In the case that $G=GL(\infty;\mathbb{C})$, the compatibility of the trace with [[direct sum]]s and [[tensor product]]s of [[vector bundle]]s over $X$ makes the above construction a [[ring]] homomorphism $K(X)\to H_{dR}(X)$ from the [[topological K-theory]] of $X$ to [[de Rham cohomology]], hence a very good candidate to being the [[Chern character]]
