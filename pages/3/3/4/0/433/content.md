#Idea#

_Enriched homotopy theory_ is about combining the notion of categories that model aspects of [[homotopy theory]] (such as [[homotopical category|homotopical categories]] and [[model category|model categories]]) with the tools of [[enriched category theory]].

Enriched homotopy theory is maybe best understood as an attempt to handle [[higher category theory|higher categories]] in terms of just 1-categorical tools: the category enriched over is in this context usually some category of "higher structures" such as [[simplicial  set|simplicial sets]] and hence the enrichment remembers that the enriched 1-category one is talking about really models a structure with higher cells, while the homotopical structure on the enriching category remembers the behaviour of these cells, in particular which of them are weak [[equivalence|equivalences]].
