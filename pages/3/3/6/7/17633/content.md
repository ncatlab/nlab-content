Let $L$ be a [[set]] equipped with both a [[partial order]] $\leq$ (whose [[opposite relation|opposite]] is denoted $\geq$), an [[inequality]] $\ne$, and a [[basepoint]] $0$.  (In [[classical mathematics]], one usually uses the [[denial inequality]], but in [[constructive mathematics]], it\'s more important that $\ne$ is [[tight relation|tight]], and even this may not be possible.)  We write $\lt$ for the conjunction of $\leq$ and $\ne$ (and $\gt$ for its opposite, the conjunction of $\geq$ and $\ne$).

Following the terminology at [[inner product space]], an element $x$ of $L$ is:

* __positive__ (or _positive semidefinite_) if $x \geq 0$,
* __negative__ (or _negative semidefinite_) if $x \leq 0$,
* __indefinite__ if $x \ne y$ whenever $y \geq 0$ or $y \leq 0$,
* __semidefinite__ if $x \ne y$ whenever $y$ is indefinite,
* __nondegenerate__ if $x \ne 0$,
* __definite__ if $x$ is semidefinite and nondegenerate,
