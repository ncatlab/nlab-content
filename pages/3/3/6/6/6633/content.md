__Coleman-Mandula theorem__ is a no-go theorem motivated by the possibilities of Lie group symmetries in quantum field theory in Minkowski space-time. It says that any Lie group containing the Poincare group $P$ (in 4d) as a subgroup and containing a maximal internal symmetry group $G$ must be a direct product of those. In addition $G$ must be a semisimple group with additional $U(1)$ factors. 

Gel'fand and Likhtman showed that with a slight extension of the concept of Lie group one can get that $P$ and $G$ combine in a nontrivial way. This happens for example in supersymmetric case.
