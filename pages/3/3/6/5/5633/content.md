Eric Sharpe works on [[theoretical physics]] related to [[string theory]] with an emphasis on structural aspects and mathematical formalization. He has early on realized the role of [[stack]]s and [[gerbe]]s in string theory (see his work on "[[discrete torsion]]"). More recently he has been investigating [[quantum sheaf cohomology]]. He got his Phd under [[Edward Witten]].
