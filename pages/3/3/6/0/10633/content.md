## Idea

In [[analytic geometry]], an _affinoid_ is a sub-[[space]] of a unit [[polydisc]], formally dual to an [[affinoid algebra]] (see there for more). These are the basic spaces out of which [[analytic spaces]] are built by gluing.

> We construct non-archimedean SYZ fibrations for maximally degenerate Calabi-Yau varieties, and we show that they are affinoid torus fibrations away from a codimension two subset of the base. This confirms a prediction by Kontsevich and Soibelman. We also give an explicit description of the induced integral affine structure on the base of the SYZ fibration. Our main technical tool is a study of the structure of minimal dlt-models along one-dimensional strata.
