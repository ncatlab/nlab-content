## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f:A\to B$ in a [[2-category]] $K$ is called **(representably) fully-faithful** (or sometimes just **ff**) if for all objects $X$, the functor
$$K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$$
is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]].  One easily checks that in [[Cat]] this is the same as $f$ itself being full and faithful.

## Remarks

* Fully faithful morphisms in a 2-category may also be called **1-monic**, and be said to make their source into a **1-subobject** of their target.  See [[subcategory]] for some discussion.

* Fully faithful morphisms are often the right class of a [[factorization system in a 2-category|factorization system]].  The left class in $Cat$ consists of [[essentially surjective functors]].

* Just as in a 1-category any [[equalizer]] is [[monic]], in a 2-category any [[inverter]] or [[equifier]] is fully faithful.

## Variations

This is not always the "right" notion of fully-faithfulness in a 2-category.  In particular, in [[enriched category theory]] this definition does not recapture the correct notion of enriched fully-faithfulness.  It is possible, however, to characterize $V$-fully-faithful functors 2-categorically; see [[codiscrete cofibration]].
