A dg-algebra is a monoid in the symmetric monoidal category of (possibly unbounded) (co)chain complexes where the tensor product is given by 
$$
(A\otimes B)_n =\sum_{i+j=n} A_i\otimes B_j,
$$
with the differential $d_{A\otimes B} = d_A\otimes B+A\otimes d_B$. [[cochain algebra|Cochain algebra]] is a synonym for dg-algebra when the differential $d$ is raising degree (cochain convention) and [[chain algebra]] is a synonym for dg-algebra if $d$ is lowering degree (chain convention).
