A __dg-algebra__, or __differential graded algebra__, is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of (possibly unbounded) (co)[[chain complex]]es where the tensor product is given by
$$
(A\otimes B)_n = \sum_{i+j=n} A_i\otimes B_j,
$$
with the differential $d_{A\otimes B} = d_A\otimes B + A\otimes d_B$ (following the product rule from ordinary calculus).

A __cochain algebra__ is simply a dg-algebra following the cochain convention (when the differential $d$ is raises the degree); a __chain algebra__ is simply a dg-algebra following the chain convention (where $d$ lowers the degree).
