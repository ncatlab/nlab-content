## Idea

A [[vacuum state]] for an [[interacting field theory]] is sometimes called, for emphasis, an _interacting vacuum_.

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] one starts with a [[free field theory]] and a [[vacuum state]] (or [[Hadamard vacuum state]]) on that, the "free vacuum"; and then finds, perturbatively, the [[interacting field algebra of observables]]. The free vacuum is typically still a [[state on a star-algebra|state]] on the [[interacting field algebra of observables]], but it is in general no longer a _vacuum_ state with respect to the interacting field algebra. To highlight the difference to an actual vacuum state for the interacting field algebra, one speaks of the _interacting vacuum_ (e.g. [Rafelski 90](#Rafelski90)).

Issues related to the [[adiabatic limit]] and [[infrared divergences]] in [[perturbative QFT]] are argued to be related to the need to pass to the correct interacting vacuum ([Duch 17, p. 113-114](#Duch17)).

This is understood to some extent in [[quantum electrodynamics]] but remains a major open problem in [[quantum chromodynamics]] ([below](#InQCD)).

## Examples

### In QCD
 {#InQCD}

There are arguments that the phenomenon of [[confinement]] in [[QCD]] will be explained by finding the properly interacting vacuum of the perturbative theory ([Rafelski 90, around pages 12-16](#Rafelski90)). Possibly this is a "[[theta-vacuum]]" reflecting [[instanton in QCD|QCD instanton]] contributions ([Schäfer-Shuryak 98, section III D](#SchaeferShuryak98)).
