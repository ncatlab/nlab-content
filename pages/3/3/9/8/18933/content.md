## Idea

A [[vacuum state]] for an [[interacting field theory]] is sometimes called, for emphasis, an _interacting vacuum_.

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] one starts with a [[free field theory]] and a [[vacuum state]] (or [[Hadamard vacuum state]]) on that, the "free vacuum"; and then finds, perturbatively, the [[interacting field algebra of observables]]. The free vacuum is typically still a [[state on a star-algebra|state]] on the [[interacting field algebra of observables]], but it is in general no longer a _vacuum_ state with respect to the interacting field algebra. To highlight the difference to an actual vacuum state for the interacting field algebra, one speaks of the _interacting vacuum_.
