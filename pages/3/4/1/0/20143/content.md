## Definition

Let $(V,\otimes,I)$ be a [[monoidal category]] and $C$ a $V$-[[enriched category]].  The **underlying ordinary category** of $C$ is the ordinary [[category]] $C_0$ with the same objects and with hom-sets

$$C_0(x,y) = V(I,C(x,y)).$$

This is an instance of [[change of enriching category]].
