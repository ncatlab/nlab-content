## Idea

The [[direct product group]] of the [[group of order 2]] with itself is known as the _Klein four group_:

$$
  \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2
  \,.
$$



## Properties

### General 
 {#General}

Besides the [[cyclic group of order 4]] $\mathbb{Z}/4$, the Klein group $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2$ is the only other [[group]] of [[order]] 4, up to [[isomorphism]]. (This follows, for instance, by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], as in [this example](fundamental+theorem+of+finitely+generated+abelian+groups#TwoFiniteGroupsOfOrderp2)).

In particular the Klein group is _not_ itself a [[cyclic group]], and it is in fact the smallest non-[[trivial group|trivial]] [[group]] which is not a [[cyclic group]].

### ADE-Classification

In the [[ADE-classification]] of [[finite subgroups of SO(3)]], the Klein four-group is the smallest in the D-series, labeled by [[D4]].
