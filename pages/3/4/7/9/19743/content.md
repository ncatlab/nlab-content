## Idea

The [[direct product group]] of the [[group of order 2]] with itself is known as the _Klein four group_:

$$
  \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2
  \,.
$$

## Properties

In the [[ADE-classification]] of [[finite subgroups of SO(3)]], the Klein four-group is the smallest in the D-series, labeled by [[D4]].
