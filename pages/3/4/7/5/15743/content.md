## Idea

The **Waldhausen K-theory** of a [[dg-category]] is defined as the [[Waldhausen K-theory]] of a [[Waldhausen category]] associated to it.  It is an _additive invariant_ in the sense of [[noncommutative motives]].  There is a [[non-connective algebraic K-theory|nonconnective]] variant studied by [[Marco Schlichting]], which is a _localizing invariant_ (again in the sense of [[noncommutative motives]]).

On the other hand, one could define the K-theory of a [[pretriangulated dg-category]] as the [[algebraic K-theory]] of its [[dg-nerve]], which is a [[stable infinity-category]].  This should coincide with the Waldhausen K-theory (presumably).

## Definition

Let $A$ be a [[dg-category]].  Consider the [[triangulated category]] $D(A)$ of [[dg-presheaves]] on $A$, and let $perf(A) \subset D(A)$ denote its [[full subcategory]] of [[compact objects]].  There is the structure of a [[Waldhausen category]] on $perf(A)$ where the [[weak equivalences]] are objectwise [[quasi-isomorphisms]] and the [[cofibrations]] are degreewise [[split monomorphisms]].  The **Waldhausen K-theory** of $A$ is the [[Waldhausen K-theory]] of $perf(A)$ with this Waldhausen structure.
