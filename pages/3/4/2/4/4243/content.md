## Idea

What is called the _A-model_ is the 2-dimensional [[topological conformal field theory]] corresponding to the [[Calabi-Yau category]] called the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] $X$. This is is effectively the [[Gromov-Witten theory]] of $X$.

The A-model arose in formal [[physics]] from considerations of [[string theory|superstring]]-propagation on Calabi-Yau spaces: it may be motivated by considering the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d[[CFT|SCFT]] given by the supersymmetric [[sigma-model]] with target $X$ and then deforming it such that one of the super-[[Virasoro-algebra|Virasoro]] generators squares to 0. The resulting "topologically twisted" algebra may then be read as being the [[BRST complex]] of a [[TCFT]].

By [[homological mirror symmetry]], the A-model is dual to the  [[B-model]].

The motivation from the point of view of [[string theory]] is reviewed for instance in
