## Idea

What is called the _A-model_ is the 2-dimensional [[topological conformal field theory]] corresponding to the [[Calabi–Yau category]] called the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] $X$. This is is effectively the [[Gromov–Witten theory]] of $X$.

The A-model arose in formal [[physics]] from considerations of [[string theory|superstring]]-propagation on Calabi-Yau spaces: it may be motivated by considering the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d[[CFT|SCFT]] given by the supersymmetric [[sigma-model]] with target $X$ and then deforming it such that one of the super-[[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro]] generators squares to $0$. The resulting "topologically twisted" algebra may then be read as being the [[BRST complex]] of a [[TCFT]].

One can also define an A-model for [[Landau-Ginzburg model|Landau–Ginzburg models]]. The category of [[D-brane|D-branes]] for the open string theory is given by the [[Fukaya–Seidel category]].

By [[homological mirror symmetry]], the A-model is dual to the  [[B-model]].

## Lagrangian

The [[action functional]] of the A-model is that associated by [[AKSZ theory]] to a Lagrangian sumbaifold in a target [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] which is the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] of a [[symplectic manifold]].

See the [references on Lagrangian formulation](#LagrangianLit).

## Boundary theory

On coisotropic [[brane]]s in symplectic target manifolds that arise by complexification of [[phase space]]s, the boundary [[path integral]] of the A-model computes the [[quantization]] of that phase space. For details see

* [[quantization via the A-model]].
