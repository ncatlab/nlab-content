## Idea

What is called the _A-model_ [[topological string]] is the 2-dimensional [[topological conformal field theory]] corresponding to the [[Calabi?Yau category]] called the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] $X$. This is is effectively the [[Gromov?Witten theory]] of $X$.

The A-model arose in formal [[physics]] from considerations of [[string theory|superstring]]-propagation on [[Calabi-Yau spaces]]: it may be motivated by considering the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d[[CFT|SCFT]] given by the [[supersymmetric sigma-model]] with [[target space]] $X$ and then deforming it such that one of the super-[[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro]] generators squares to $0$. The resulting "topologically twisted" algebra may then be read as being the [[BRST complex]] of a [[TCFT]].

One can also define an A-model for [[Landau-Ginzburg model|Landau?Ginzburg models]]. The category of [[D-brane|D-branes]] for the corresponding [[open string]] theory is given by the [[Fukaya?Seidel category]].

By [[homological mirror symmetry]], the A-model is dual to the  [[B-model]].

## Properties

### Lagrangian

The [[action functional]] of the A-model is that associated by [[AKSZ theory]] to a Lagrangian [[submanifold]] in a [[target space|target]] [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] which is the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] of a [[symplectic manifold]].

See the _[references on Lagrangian formulation](#LagrangianLit)_.

### Boundary theory / holography

On [[coisotropic submanifold|coisotropic]] [[branes]] in symplectic target manifolds that arise by complexification of [[phase spaces]], the boundary [[path integral]] of the A-model computes the [[quantization]] of that phase space. For details see

* [[quantization via the A-model]].

and

* [[holographic principle]].

### Second quantization / effective background field theory
 {#SecondQuantization}

The [[second quantization]] [[effective field theory|effective]] background field theory defined by the [[perturbation series]] of the A-model string has been argued to be [[Chern-Simons theory]]. ([Witten 92](#Witten92), [Costello 06](#Costello06))

For more on this see at _[TCFT -- Worldsheet and effective background theories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/TCFT#ActionFunctionals)_. A related mechanism is that of _[[world sheets for world sheets]]_.
