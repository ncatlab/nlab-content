An $A_\infty$-category is a variation of a [[category]] 
in which the associativity condition on the [[composition]] of [[morphism]]s is relaxed:

in an $A_\infty$-category composition of [[morphism]]s is associative only up to "higher coherent homotopy" in some sense:

* in the case of [[enriched category|enrichement]] over [[Vect]], the concept _$A_\infty$-category_ is the [[horizontal categorification]] of [[A-infinity-algebra]];

* more generally, one can describe $A_\infty$-categories as a generalization of algebras over [[operad]]s.

* The classical notion of [[bicategory]] can be interpreted as an $A_\infty$-category in [[Cat]] for a suitable Cat-operad.

See the example appearing at [[interval object]] and [[Trimble n-category]].

mostly discusses just [[A-infinity algebra]]s, but points out a generalizations to $A_\infty$-categories, see the overview on [p. 3](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0606/0606241v2.pdf#page=3)

One point made there is that in the linear case, apart from the [[operad]]ic definition there is a geometric definition of $A_\infty$-categories. Essentially the authors say that an $A_\infty$-category should be a non(-graded-)commutative [[NQ-supermanifold]]. Recall that a graded-commutative [[NQ-supermanifold]] is a [[L-infinity-algebroid]]. From this perspective one would want to think of a non-graded commutative [[NQ-supermanifold]] as an _$A_\infty$-algebroid_.
