The concept $A_\infty$-category is a variation of [[category]] 
in which the associativity condition on the  [[composition]] of [[morphism]]s is relaxed:

in an $A_\infty$-category composition of [[morphism]]s is associative only up to "higher coherent homotopy" in some sense:

* in the case of [[enriched category|enrichement]] over [[Vect]], the concept _$A_\infty$-category_ is the [[horizontal categorification]] of [[A-infinity-algebra]];

* more generally, one can describe $A_\infty$-categories in terms of algebras [[operad]]s.

See the example appearing at [[interval object]] and [[Trimble's notion of weak n-category]].
