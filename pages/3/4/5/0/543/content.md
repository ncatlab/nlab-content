An $A_\infty$-category is a variation of a [[category]] 
in which the associativity condition on the [[composition]] of [[morphism]]s is relaxed:

in an $A_\infty$-category composition of [[morphism]]s is associative only up to "higher coherent homotopy" in some sense:

* in the case of [[enriched category|enrichement]] over [[Vect]], the concept _$A_\infty$-category_ is the [[horizontal categorification]] of [[A-infinity-algebra]];

* more generally, one can describe $A_\infty$-categories as a generalization of algebras over [[operad]]s.

* The classical notion of [[bicategory]] can be interpreted as an $A_\infty$-category in [[Cat]] for a suitable Cat-operad.

See the example appearing at [[interval object]] and [[Trimble n-category]].
