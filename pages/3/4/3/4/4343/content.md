## Idea ##
The notion of $*-$category combines that of a [[dagger-category]] and of an $\mathbb{C}-$[[algebroid]]. While $*-$categories were popular in [[AQFT]] for a while, the notion of [[dagger-category]] was introduced in the context of [[quantum information theory]], this page serves mainly the purpose to point out this connection.

## Definition ##

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
A *-category is a [[dagger-category]] and a $\mathbb{C}-$[[algebroid]] such that the dagger operation is conjugate linear.
=--

In this context $*-$operation and dagger operation $\dagger$ are used synonymously.
