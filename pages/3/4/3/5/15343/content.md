Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be [[pretoposes]], and let $f: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be a pretopos functor (that is, a functor which preserves finite coproducts, finite limits, and epimorphisms). Let $M(\mathcal{C})$ be the category of models of $\mathcal{C}$ (that is, pretopos functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to the category of sets) and define $M(\mathcal{D})$ similarly.

The conceptual completeness theorem of Makkai-Reyes asserts that if $f$ induces an [[equivalence of categories]] $M(f):M(\mathcal{D}) \to M(\mathcal{C})$, then $f$ is itself an equivalence of categories.
