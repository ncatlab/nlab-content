A __cartesian monoidal category__ is a [[monoidal category]] whose monoidal structure is given by the category-theoretic [[product]] (and so whose unit is a [[terminal object]]).  Any category with finite products can be considered as a cartesian monoidal category (as long as we have either (1) a specified product for each pair of objects, (2) a global [[axiom of choice]], or (3) we allow the monoidal product to be an [[anafunctor]]).  Note that the term __cartesian category__ usually means a category with finite products but can also mean a [[finitely complete category]].

Cartesian monoidal categories have a number of special and important properties, such as the existence of a diagonal maps $A \to A\otimes A$ and augmentations $A\to I$ for any object $A$.  These maps make any object into a [[comonoid]] in a unique way.  Moreover, one can show that any monoidal category equipped with suitably well-behaved diagonals and augmentations _must_ in fact be cartesian monoidal.

A cartesian monoidal category which is also [[closed monoidal category|closed]] is called a [[cartesian closed category]].
