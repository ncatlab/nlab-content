On what is now called [[Minkowski spacetime]]:

> {#TheViewsOfSpaceAndTime} The views of space and time that I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of both will retain an independent reality.
