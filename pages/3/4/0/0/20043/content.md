## Definition
 {#Definition}

An [[object]] in a [[category]] is **weakly initial** if there exists a [[morphism]] from it to every other object in the category.

(So a weakly initial object is an actual [[initial object]] if this morphism is unique.)

Weak initiality is an instance of a [[weak colimit]]. It is also an instance of a [[weakly initial set]] that happens to be a [[singleton]] set.
