###### Definition (NQP-supermanifold)


An **N-[supermanifold]** is a supermanifold equipped with a lift of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading to a $\mathbb{N}$-grading through the standard homomorphism $even/odd : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}_2$.

A **Q-[supermanifold]** is a supermanifold equipped with an odd-graded vector field $Q$ (i.e. an odd graded derivation of the algebra of functions) which is **homological**, i.e. the super Lie bracket with itself vanishes: $[Q,Q] = 0$.

A **P-[supermanifold]** is a supermanifold equipped with a graded symplectic structure.

#Remarks#

* It is an old observation by Kontsevich, amplified by Pavol &Scaron;evera (ref...) that NQ-supermanifolds are precisely those supermanifolds which are equipped with an action of $End(\mathbb{R}^{0|1})$, the endomorphism monoid of the [[odd line]].

* NQ-supermanifolds are an equivalent way of thinking of [[Lie infinity-algebroid]]s. See the list of references there.
