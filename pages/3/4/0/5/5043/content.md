## Definition

Two [[diagrams]] $D,D'$ in a [[category]] $C$ (e.g.: directed systems, sub-posets, ... ) are **cofinal** if they have *equivalent [[colimits]]*.  

In most cases where the word "cofinal" is used, it seems to be the case $D'$ is a subdiagram of $D$ in whatever sense of subdiagram appears suitable.  In that case the cofinality is equivalent to the inclusion [[functor]] being a **[[cofinal functor]]**.


As defined above, no relation is posited between $D$ and $D'$, and so it seems not too much in violation of the [[principle of equivalence]] to define cofinalness[^1] as "a single object is a colimit for both diagrams".




It is *not* said that they are final if they have equivalent *[[limits]]* --- the "co"s are not freely mutable, although the dual situation is doubtless just as interesting.


## Examples

* Let $D' = D F$, and let $L\colon D \times (0 \to 1) \to C$ be an initial cocone over $D$; it seems natural to ask that $L \circ (F \times (0 \to 1))$ be an initial cocone over $D'$.

* Nonempty subsets of a finite [[total order]] are cofinal iff they have the same maximum.
* Every infinite subset of $\omega$ is cofinal with $\omega$, as diagrams in $\omega + 1$.



## Abuses

It is often said that two diagrams are cofinal even when neither has a colimit, if they acquire a common colimit on passing to a suitable completion of $C$.  This can probably be phrased internally to $C$, at the cost of intuition.

[^1]: [[cofinality|Cofinality]] is an ordinal invariant of [[ordinals]], which doesn't make sense in the present generality, so we need another name for the adjective.
