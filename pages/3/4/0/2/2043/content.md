Given a unital (typically noncommutative) ring $R$, the __Jacobson radical__ $J(R)$ is defined as the set of elements $r\in R$ satisfying the following equivalent properties:

(i) For each simple $M\in R-mod$, $rM =0$.

(ii) Each maximal left ideal of $R$ contains $r$.

(iii) For all $x\in R$, $1-rx$ is left invertible in $R$.

The properties required remain the same if interchange left and right (modules, invertibility etc.) i.e. $J(R)=J(R^{op})$.

$J(R)$ is a 2-sided ideal in $R$. The rings for which $J(R)=0$ are called __semiprimitive rings__. In other words, for each nonzero element $r$ in a semiprimitive ring, by the definition, there is a simple module left annihilated by $r$.
Given any ring $R$, the quotient $R/J(R)$ is semiprimitive.
