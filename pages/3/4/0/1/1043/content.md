The __universal constructions__ in [[category theory]] include

* [[representable functor]]

* [[adjoint functor]]

* [[limit]]/[[colimit]]

* [[end]]/[[coend]]

* [[Kan extension]]

* [[dependent sum]]/[[dependent product]]

Each of these may be defined by requiring it to satisfy a __universal property__. A universal property is a property of some construction which boils down to (is manifestly equivalent to) the property that an associated object is a universal initial object of some (auxiliary) category. 

In good cases, every single one of these is a special case of every other, so somehow one single concept here comes to us with many different faces. 

Some or all of these have analogs in [[higher category theory]], notably in [[2-category]] theory and [[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

* [[2-limit]]

* [[2-adjunction]]

* [[limit in a quasi-category]]

* [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]
