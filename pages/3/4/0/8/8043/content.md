## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[mathematics]] and especially in [[formal logic]], by a *judgement* &lbrack;[Frege (1879, §2)](#Frege1879)&rbrack; one means the *assertion* &lbrack;[Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)](#RussellWhitehead1910)&rbrack; or *validation* &lbrack;[Kochen (1961, p. 2)](#Kochen61)&rbrack; of a [[proposition]] $P$, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a [[proof]] of $P$ &lbrack;[Church (1940, §5)](#Church40)&rbrack;. 

To bring out the subtle (cf. [jstor:43154266](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43154266)) but crucial distinction --- eloquently amplified by [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)](#Martin-Löf96) --- between the notion of a [[proposition]] $P$ as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its [[truth]], it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol "$\vdash$", known as the *Urteilsstrich* (German: "judgement stroke") of &lbrack;[Frege (1879, §2)](#Frege1879)&rbrack; (see the historical pointers [below](#History)), as:

\[
  \label{JudgementInIntroduction}
  \vdash \; P
  \,.
\]

For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] certainly is a [[proposition]], but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet *judge* that it holds true: No [[proof]] is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact [[true]].

In other words, the judgement symbols "$\vdash \, P$ " convey that *we know* (a proof of, hence the truth of) $P$ &lbrack;[Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)](#Martin-Löf96)&rbrack;. 

As such, judgements may be formalized as "meta-proposition", namely [[propositions]] but in an ambient [[meta-language]] (the [[deductive system]] or [[logical framework]]) rather than to the [[object language]] in which the given $P$ itself is formulated. (More specifically, any [[deductive system]] includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the _judgments_.  Some of these symbols may themselves express a [[proposition]] in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)

More generally, one considers *hypothetical judgements* (maybe first made explicit in &lbrack;[Church (1940, §5)](#Church40)&rbrack;) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of [[proofs]] based on assumptions $A$: Writing

\[
 \label{HypotheticalJudgementInIntroduction}
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P
\]

is to express the judgement that *given* any assertion/validation/proof of $A$ we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of $P$. 

In systems of ([[dependent type theory|dependent]]) [[type theory]] (where such notation seems to go back to [Hofmann (1995, p. 31)](#Hofmann95), cf. [below](#MLDidNot)) this is quite literally the case in that the [[categorical semantics]] of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a [[function]] (and typically a [[computable function]], hence an [[algorithm]]) which [[map|maps]] proofs of $A$ to proofs of $P$.


More generally yet, in [[type theory]] the [[propositions]] $A$ and $P$ appearing here are allowed to be any ([[dependent type|dependent]]) [[types]] (see at *[[propositions as types]]*). In this generality, the [[denotational semantics]] of hypothetical judgements (eq:HypotheticalJudgementInIntroduction) is given by (computable) [[functions]]/[[morphisms]] with [[domain]] $A$ and [[codomain]] $P$.

Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of [[natural deduction]] by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation

$$
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }
$$

traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both $P_1$ as well as $P_2$ assuming a validation of $A$ (hence: given a [[pair]] of [[functions]] with [[domain]] [[type]] $A$), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their [[logical conjunction]] $P_1 \times P_2$ (namely a [[function]] with [[codomain]] to their [[product type]]).

Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic [[context]] symbol $\Gamma$ to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the *Urteilsstrich*: Notation such as

$$
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P
$$

expresses the judgement that $P$ may be asserted given validation of $\Gamma \times A$, but that in doing so only the validation of $A$ is actually made use of, while $\Gamma$ may be any [[context]] of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further [[natural deduction|deduction]] steps).



## Examples

### In first-order logic

In [[first-order logic]], a paradigmatic example of a judgement is the judgement that a certain string of symbols is a well-formed [[proposition]].  This is often written as "$P \;prop$", where $P$ is a [[metavariable]] standing for a string of symbols that denotes a proposition.

Another example of a judgement is the judgement that these symbols form a proposition [[proof|proved]] to be [[true]].  This judgment is often written as "$P\;true$".

Neither of these judgements is the same thing as the proposition $P$ itself.  In particular, the proposition is a statement *in* the logic, while the judgement that the proposition is a proposition, or is provably true, is a statement *about* the logic.  However, often people abuse notation and conflate a proposition with the judgment that it is true, writing $P$ instead of $P\;true$.


### In type theory

The distinction between judgements and [[propositions]] is particularly important in [[intensional type theory]].

The paradigmatic example of a judgment in [[type theory]] is a *typing judgment*.  The assertion that a [[term]] $t$ has [[type]] $A$ (written "$t:A$") is not a statement *in* the type theory (that is, not something which one could apply logical operators to in the type-theoretic system) but a statement *about* the type theory.

Often, type theories include only a particular small set of judgments, such as:

* typing judgments (written $t:A$, as above)

* judgments of typehood (usually written $A \;type$)

* judgments of [[equality]] between typed terms (written say $(t=t'):A$)

(In a type theory with a [[type of types]], judgments of typehood can sometimes be incorporated as a special case of typing judgments, writing $A:Type$ instead of $A\;type$.)

These limited sets of judgments are often defined [[inductive definition|inductively]] by giving [[type formation]]/[[term introduction]]/[[term elimination]]- and [[computation rules]] (see [[natural deduction]]) that specify under what hypotheses one is allowed to conclude the given judgment.

These inductive definitions can be formalized by choosing a particular [[type theory]] to be the meta-language; usually a very simple type theory suffices (such as a [[dependent type theory]] with only [[dependent product types]]).  Such a meta-type-theory is often called a [[logical framework]].


## Hypothetical and generic judgments

It may happen that a judgment $J$ is only derivable under the assumptions of certain other judgments $J_1,\dots, J_2$.  In this case one writes
$$ J_1,\dots,J_n \;\vdash J.$$
Often, however, it is convenient to incorporate hypotheticality into judgments themselves, so that $ J_1,\dots,J_n \;\vdash J $ becomes a single _[[hypothetical judgment]]_.  It can then be a consequence of other judgments, or (more importantly) a hypothesis used in concluding other judgments.  For instance, in order to conclude the truth of an [[implication]] $\phi\Rightarrow\psi$, we must conclude $\psi$ *assuming* $\phi$; thus the [[introduction rule]] for implication is
$$ \frac{\phi \;\vdash\; \psi}{\vdash\; \phi\Rightarrow\psi}$$
with a hypothetical judgment as its hypothesis.  See [[natural deduction]] for a more extensive discussion.

In a [[type theory]], we may also consider the case where the hypotheses $J_1$ are typing judgments of the form $x:A$, where $x$ is a [[variable]], and in which the conclusion judgment $J$ involves these variables as [[free variables]].  For instance, $J$ could be $\phi\;prop$, where $\phi$ is a valid (well-formed) proposition only when $x$ has a specific [[type]] $X$.  In this case we have a _[[generic judgement]]_, written
$$ (x \colon X) \;\vdash\; (\phi \; prop). $$
which expresses that _assuming the hypothesis or [[antecedent]] judgement_ that $x$ is of type $X$, as a consequence we have the [[succedent]] judgement that $\phi$ is a proposition. If on the right here we have a typing judgment 

$$
  (x \colon X) \;\vdash\; (t \colon A)
$$

we have a _[[term in context]]_.

For more about the precise relationship between the various meanings of $\vdash$ here, see [[natural deduction]] and [[logical framework]].

While this may seem to be a very basic form of (hypothetical/generic) judgement only, in systems such as [[dependent type theory]] or [[homotopy type theory]], all of [[logic]] and a good bit more is all based on just this.


## History of the notion and notation

    }
\end{imagefromfile}


The terminology of *judgement* in [[formal logic]], and the notation

$$
  \vdash A
$$

for the *judgement* of *content* $A$ is due to [Frege (1879, §2)](#Frege1879) (Frege's *das Urtheil* -- or *das Urteil* in modern German spelling -- directly translates to: *the judgement*).

{#RusselWhiteheadAssertion} This notion and notation (often "Frege's Urteilsstrich" -- "judgement stroke") was adopted by [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)](#RussellWhitehead1910), who however speak of "assertion" instead of "judgement"  --- see [Martin-Löf (1996, p. 6)](#Martin-Löf96) for speculation that these authors may have wanted "to avoid any association with Kantian philosophy" (cf. [below](#KantTheoryOfJudgement)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "RussellWhitehead-Assertion.jpg",
    "width": 650,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 20
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

and then by [Church (1940, §5)](#Church40) (without any attribution) --- now allowing hypotheses/assumptions on the left of the *Urteilsstrich* --- to mean *provable* under these assumptions:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Church-ProvableUnderAssumptions.jpg",
    "width": 700,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -40,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 20
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Similarly, [Kochen (1961, p. 2)](#Kochen61) introduced (in a context of [[model theory]]) the notation "$\mathfrak{A} \;\vDash\; P$" (apparently not actively remembering its historical origin, cf. [Kochen (2017)](#Kochen17)) for a notion in [[model theory]] pronounced  "$\mathfrak{A}$ *validates* $P$" --- which is at least closely related to these hypothetical judgements (and often used synonymously, e.g. [here](https://open.conted.ox.ac.uk/sites/open.conted.ox.ac.uk/files/resources/Create%20Document/Turnstiles.pdf)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Kochen-Validation.jpg",
    "width": 700,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -40,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 20
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


The need (which had been contested by some logicians such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], cf. [jstor:43154266](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43154266)) for Frege's distinction between a proposition "$A$", as such, and its judgement/assertion/proof/validation "$\vdash A$" was eloquently argued for by [Martin-Löf (1984, pp. 2)](#Martin-Löf84), [(1987)](#Martin-Löf87) and in [(1996, lectures 1-2)](#Martin-Löf96), together with a re-promotion of Frege's *Urteilsstrich* notation "$\vdash$" ([ML84, p. 2](#Martin-Löf84),  [ML96, p. 2, 6](#Martin-Löf96)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Martin-Loef--Judgement.jpg",
    "width": 620,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 20
    }
\end{imagefromfile}



The notation for *hypothetical* judgements

\[
  \label{GenericHypotheticalJudgement}
  context \;\vdash\; judgement
\]

was then (without attribution to Church or Martin-Löf) adopted for [[dependent type theory]] in [Hofmann (1995, p. 31)](#Hofmann95), later published as [Hofmann (1997, p. 82)](#Hofmann97):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Hofmann-judgements.jpg",
    "width": 610,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 20
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

This eventually became the trademark of the practice of [[dependent type theory]] (though mostly used without any attribution), e.g.: [Jacobs (1998, p. 2, 121, 586)](dependent+type+theory#Jacobs98); [Bauer, Haselwarter & Lumsdaine (2020)](#BauerHaselwarterLumsdaine20).

{#MLDidNot} (Curiously, apparently [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]] did not actually use the general notation (eq:GenericHypotheticalJudgement) in publications: When in [1996, p. 29](#Martin-Löf96) it comes to hypothetical judgements, he switched to using just a vertical "$\vert$" instead of "$\vdash$".)
