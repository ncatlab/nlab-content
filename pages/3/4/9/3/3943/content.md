## Idea

The analog in [[(∞,1)-category]] theory of the/a [[adjoint functor theorem]] in ordinary [[category theory]].

## Statement


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $F = C \to D$ be an [[(∞,1)-functor]] between [[locally presentable (∞,1)-categories]] then

1. it has a right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] precisely if it preserves small [[limit in a quasi-category|colimits]];

1. it has a left [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] precisely if it is an [[accessible (∞,1)-functor]] and preserves small [[limit in a quasi-category|limits]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 5.5.2.9]].
