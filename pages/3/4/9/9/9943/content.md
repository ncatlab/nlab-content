## Idea

The _Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem_ ([Goerss-Hopkins A](#GoerssHopkinsA), [Goerss-Hopkins B](#GoerssHopkinsB)) also called now the _Goerss-Hopkins-Miller-Lurie theorem_ ([[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|Lurie (Survey)]], [[Representability Theorems|Lurie (Representability)]]) as such establishes that the assignment to each [[elliptic curve]] of its [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic]] [[cohomology theory]] lifts in a [[coherence|coherent]] way to an assignment of the [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] [[spectra]] regarded as [[E-∞ rings]]. In summay this makes for a [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}^{der}}$ of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] in [[derived algebraic geometry]], realizing that moduli stack  as a [[derived scheme]] $\mathcal{M}^{der}$ in [[E-∞ geometry]] ("spectral geometry") This is sketched in ([[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|Lurie]]) and discussed in detail in ([Behrens 13](#Behrens13)).

In detail the theorem utilizes and establishes more general tools concerning the [[obstruction]] theory of lifting [[formal group laws]] to [[cohomology theories]] and homotopy associative/commutative [[spectra]] to [[A-∞ rings]] and to [[E-∞ ring]] structure, respectively. 

In the succinct and suggestive form of ([[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|Lurie, theorem 1.1]]) the Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem leads the existence of the lift $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}^{top}}$ in the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    && E_\infty Rings
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}^{der}}}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Brown\;representation}}
    \\
    \mathcal{M}(R)
    &\longrightarrow&
    MCTs
  }
  \,,
$$

where the bottom map sends ([[derived elliptic curve|derived]]) [[elliptic curves]] over a [[ring]] $R$ to their associated [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic]] [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] ("MTC") and where the right vertical map sends a [[spectrum]] to the cohomology theory which it [[Brown representability theorem|represents]].

### Hopkins-Miller theorem

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[pairs]] consisting of a [[perfect field]] $k$ of finite [[characteristic]] and of a [[formal group]] of [[height of a formal group|height]] $n$, and whose [[morphisms]] are base change of fields (as rings).

The **Hopkins-Miller theorem** says that there is a functorial assignment $(k,\Gamma) \mapsto E_{k,\Gamma}$ to such data of an [[A-∞ ring]] [[spectrum]] $E_{k,\Gamma}$ such that

1. $\pi_2 E_{k,\Gamma}$ contains a [[unit]] and $\pi_{2n+1} E_{k,\Gamma} = 0$, hence in particular $E_{k,\Gamma}$ is [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientable]];

1. the corresponding [[formal group law]] over $\pi_0 E_{k,\Gamma}$ is the [[Lubin-Tate formal group|universal deformation]] of $(k,\Gamma)$.

In this form this appears as ([Rezk 97, theorem 2.1](#Rezk97)).

### Goerss-Hopkins theorem

(...) 

this appears reproduced as ([Behrens 13, theorem 4.2](#Behrens13))

### Lurie theorem
 {#LurieTheorem}

By ([[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|Lurie (Survey), theorem 4.1]]), the [[spectral Deligne-Mumford stack]] refinement $(\mathcal{M}_{ell}, \mathcal{O}^{top})$ of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] is the moduli stack of [[derived elliptic curves]], in that there is a [[natural equivalence]] in [[E-∞ rings]] $A$ of the form

$$
  Hom(Spec(A), (\mathcal{M}_{ell},\mathcal{O}^{der}))
  \simeq
  E(A)
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have maps of [[structured (∞,1)-toposes]] and on the right the [[∞-groupoid]] of [[derived elliptic curves]] over $A$.

This is based on the representability theorem ([[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|Lurie (Survey), prop. 4.1]], [[Representability Theorems|Lurie (Representability)]]).
