## Idea

A _solid torus_ is a [[topological space]] (a [[manifold with boundary]]) [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topological space]] $S^1 \times D^2$ of [[generalized the|the]] [[circle]] with [[generalized the|the]] [[2-disk]], whose [[boundary]] is hence [[generalized the|the]] actual [[torus]].
