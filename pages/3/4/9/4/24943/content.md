## Idea

The notion of abstract rewriting system is the simplest mathematical formalization of what is a [[rewriting system]]. It doesn't presuppose anything on the nature of the [[syntax|syntactical]] objects which are rewritten, thus the word "abstract".


## Definition

An **abstract rewriting system** $(X, \rightarrow)$ is given by a [[set]] $X$ and a [[binary relation]] $\rightarrow$ on $X$, ie. a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $X \times X$.

So this is a [[concept with an attitude]]: While an abstract re-writing system is just a [[relation]], calling this relation an abstract rewriting system indicates that one is interested in studying the behaviour of chains of related elements $x \to x_1 \to x_2 \to \cdots$ (thought of as successive stages of [[rewriting]] $x$), for instance to see if they are [[confluent category|confluent]].
