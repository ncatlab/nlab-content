## Idea

The notion of abstract rewriting system is the simplest mathematical formalization of what is a [[rewriting system]]. It doesn't presuppose anything on the nature of the syntactical objects which are rewritten, thus the word "abstract".

## Definition

An **abstract rewriting system** $(X, \rightarrow)$ is given by a [[set]] $X$ and a [[binary relation]] $\rightarrow$ on $X$, ie. a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $X \times X$.
