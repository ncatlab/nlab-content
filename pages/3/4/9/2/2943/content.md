It is practically impossible to model macroscopic systems in terms of microscopic kynematical and dynamical variables of all its particles. Thus one makes a hierarchial reduction in which this complexity is reduced to snall number of collective variables. The theoretical framewok for such reductions for systems is statistical mechanics. One special case of hierarchial reduction is the limit of large volumes $V$, in which the number of particles (of each species) $N/V$ stays constant. This is called the **thermodynamic limit** in statistical physics. Under some standard assumptions like homogeneity (spacial and possibly directional), stability (no transietory effects) there is a small number of collective variables characterizing the system. Such descrpition can be postulated as an independent self-consistent phenomenological theory even without going into the details of statistical mechanics; such a description is called **equilibrium thermodynamics**, however believed to be deducable from statistical mechanics, what is partially proved for some classes of systems. Sometimes transitional finite-time phenomena are described either statistically by studying stochastic processes or by more elaborate hierarchial form of thermodynamics, so-called **nonequilibrium thermodynamics**. 

One of the basic characteristics of the thermodynamical systems is the temperature. Other common thermodynamical variables include pressure, volume, entropy, enthalpy etc.
