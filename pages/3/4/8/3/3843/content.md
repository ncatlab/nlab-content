## Definition

A [[functor]]

$$
  F\colon C\to D
$$ 

is a **$\kappa$-accessible functor** (for $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]]) if $C$ and $D$ are both $\kappa$-[[accessible categories]] and $F$ preserves $\kappa$-[[filtered colimit]]s.  $F$ is an **accessible functor** if it is $\kappa$-accessible for some regular cardinal $\kappa$.

## Properties

### Raising the index of accessibility

If $\lambda\le\kappa$, then every $\kappa$-filtered colimit is also $\lambda$-filtered, and thus if $F$ preserves $\lambda$-filtered colimits then it also preserves $\kappa$-filtered ones.  Therefore, if $F$ is $\lambda$-accessible and $C$ and $D$ are $\kappa$-accessible, then $F$ is $\kappa$-accessible.  Two conditions under which this happens are:

1. $C$ and $D$ are [[locally presentable categories]].

2. $\lambda$ is [[sharply smaller cardinal|sharply smaller]] than $\kappa$, i.e. $\lambda\lhd\kappa$.

In particular, for any accessible functor $F$ there are arbitrarily large cardinals $\kappa$ such that $F$ is $\kappa$-accessible, and if the domain and codomain of $F$ are locally presentable then $F$ is $\kappa$-accessible for all sufficiently large $\kappa$.

### Preserving presentable objects

For any accessible functor $F$, there are arbitrarily large cardinals $\kappa$ such that $F$ is $\kappa$-accessible and preserves $\kappa$-[[presentable objects]].  Indeed, this can be achieved simultaneously for any set of accessible functors.  See [Adamek-Rosicky, Theorem 2.19](#AdamekRosicky).
