## Idea

The _quantum geometric Langlands correspondence_ is a conjectured equivalence between the [[derived category]] of certain twisted [[D-module]]s on the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over some complex curve for some [[reductive group]] $G$, and that of $D$-modules with a dual twist on the stack of ${}^L G$-bundles, for ${}^L G$ the [[Langlands dual group]].

In a certain limit of the twisting parameter the $D$-modules on one side of this correspondence become equivalent to just $\mathcal{O}$-modules, but on the moduli space of [[local system]]s. This limit of the quantum correspondence reproduces the statement of the (ordinary) [[geometric Langlands correspondence]].


Slightly more precisely, writing $Bun_G^\circ$ for the connected component of the moduli stack of $G$-bundles, there is a [[line bundle]] denoted $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes k}$ on $Bun_G^\circ$ and dually a line bundle $\hat \mathcal{L}^{\otimes k}$ on $Bun_{{}^L G}^\circ$ and these serve to defined sheaves $\mathcal{D}^{(k,\lambda)}$ of twisted differential operators on $Bun_{G}^\circ$ and dually sheaves $\hat \mathcal{G}^{(k,\lambda)}$ of twisted differential operators on $Bun_{{}^L G}^\circ$, where the parameters lie in

$$
  (k, \lambda) \in \mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$

Writing then $\mathcal{D}^{k,\lambda} Mod(Bun_{G})$ and $\hat \mathcal{D}^{k,\lambda} Mod(Bun_{{}^L G})$, respectively, for the derived categories of modules over these sheaves, the conjectured statement is:

**Quantum geometric Langlands correspondence**

There is an equivalence

$$
  \mathcal{D}^{k,\lambda} Mod(Bun_{G})
  \simeq
  \hat \mathcal{D}^{\frac{1}{k},\lambda} Mod(Bun_{{}^L G})
  \,.
$$

(In fact $k$ and $\frac{1}{k}$ here should further be shifted by the [[dual Coxeter number]] of $G$ and ${}^L G$, respectively.)


## Embedding in string theory

Where the plain [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] is meant to be a shadow of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal field theory]], the quantum version is meant to correspondingly relate to 6d [[little string theory]] ([Aganagic-Frenkel-Okounkov 17](#AganagicFrenkelOkounkov17)) (which turns into the 6d QFT in the limit that the strings shrink to points).
 
## Examples


### Limiting cases

The twisted sheaves of differential operators $\mathcal{D}^{k,\lambda}$ have the following limits:

* For $\lambda \neq 0$ and $k \neq \infty$ this is the sheaf of differential operators acting on $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes k}$;

* for $\lambda \neq 0$ and $k = \infty$ this is the pushforward $p_*(\mathcal{O}_{Loc_G})$ of the sheaf of $\mathcal{O}$-modules along the canonical $P : Loc_G \to Bun_G$ that sends a local system to its underlying bundle;

* for $\lambda = 0$ and $k$ arbitrary this is $p_*(\mathcal{O}_{T^* Bun_G^\circ})$.

### Abelian case

In the case where $G$ is abelian, the quantum correspondence is given by a [[Fourier-Mukai transform]] and has been constructed in ([Polishuk-Rothenstein](#PolishukRothenstein))
