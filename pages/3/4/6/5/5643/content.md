## Idea

A _smooth super $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[∞-groupoid]] equiped with [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesion]] in the form of [[supermanifold]]-structure.

## Definition

Let [[CartSp]]${}_{super}$ be the [[site]] of [[supermanifold]] of the form $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ and smooth superfunctions between them, equipped with the [[coverage]] of [[good open cover]]s.

This is a [[∞-cohesive site]], by the same argument as [[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$ is.

The [[(∞,1)-topos]] of **super smooth ∞-groupoids** is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]

$$
 SSmooth\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{super})
 \,.
$$

## Properties

This is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. It is an <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive%20(infinity,1)-topos#structures_in_the_presence_of_infinitesimal_cohesion_149">infinitesimal thickening</a> of [[Smooth∞Grpd]]. As such it is similar to [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] but differs subtly from it. Both are unified in the $(\infty,1)$-topos [[SSynthDiff∞Grpd]] of _super synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoids_
