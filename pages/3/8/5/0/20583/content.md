## Idea

When we define internal categories of some category $\mathcal{C}$ as monads in $\mathrm{Span}(\mathcal{C})$, there is a subtlety concerning the definition of internal functors. It is not the case that the morphisms of monads (namely colax monad morphisms) give us internal functors directly: we need to ask that the 1-cell of the morphism is a left adjoint in $\mathrm{Span}(\mathcal{C})$ (which corresponds to asking that the left leg of the span be the identity, or an isomorphism). (This is related to the [[profunctor#Properties|behaviour of profunctors]] in that they correspond to functors (via Yoneda) exactly when they are left adjoints.)  If in considering morphisms of monads in $Span(\mathcal{C})$ we _don't_ require this left-adjoint condition then we end up constructing **Mealy morphisms** between internal categories. 

'Mealy morphisms' are  named after [[Mealy machines]], which, in turn, were named after  [[George H. Mealy]].

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be categories [[enriched category|enriched]] in a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathbf{V}, I, \otimes)$. 

A *Mealy morphism* $(F, \phi) \colon \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$ 
consists of a pair of functions $F \colon Ob\mathbf{A} \rightarrow Ob\mathbf{B}$ and $\phi \colon \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{V}$, 
and for each pair of objects $A, A'$ in $\mathbf{A}$ a function
\[
\phi(A, A') \colon \mathbf{A}(A, A') \otimes \phi(A) \longrightarrow \phi(A') \otimes \mathbf{B}(FA, FA')
\]
satisfying the following commutative diagrams. 
\begin{tikzcd}
I \otimes \phi(A) 
\arrow[d, "\cong"']
\arrow[r, "{j_{A} \otimes 1}"]
& \mathbf{A}(A, A) \otimes \phi(A)
\arrow[d, "{\phi(A, A)}"]
\\
\phi(A) \otimes I
\arrow[r, "{1 \otimes j_{FA}}"']
& \phi(A) \otimes \mathbf{B}(FA, FA)
\end{tikzcd}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathbf{A}(A', A'') \otimes \mathbf{A}(A, A') \otimes \phi(A)
\arrow[r, "{\circ_{A, A', A''} \otimes \phi(A)}"]
\arrow[d, "1 \otimes {\phi(A, A')}"']
&[+3em] \mathbf{A}(A, A'') \otimes \phi(A)
\arrow[dd, "{\phi(A, A'')}"]
\\
\mathbf{A}(A', A'') \otimes \phi(A') \otimes \mathbf{B}(FA, FA')
\arrow[d, "{\phi(A', A'') \otimes 1}"']
& 
\\
\phi(A'') \otimes \mathbf{B}(FA', FA'') \mathbf{B}(FA, FA')
\arrow[r, "1 \otimes \circ_{FA, FA', FA''}"']
& \phi(A'') \otimes \mathbf{B}(FA, FA'')
\end{tikzcd}
