#Idea#

_Directed spaces_ are to general $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]] as ordinary [[topological space|topological spaces]] are to $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] via the [[homotopy hypothesis]].

Directed spaces are studied in [[directed homotopy theory]], a relatively young topic. In generalizatoin of how a [[topological space]] has a [[fundamental groupoid]], a [[directed space]] has a [[fundamental category]].
