#Idea#

_Directed spaces_ are to general $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]] as ordinary [[topological space|topological spaces]] are to $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] via the [[homotopy hypothesis]].

Directed spaces are studied in [[directed homotopy theory]], a relatively young topic. In generalization of how a [[topological space]] has a [[fundamental groupoid]], a [[directed space]] has a [[fundamental category]].

#Discussion#

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: [[ericforgy:Discrete differential geometry on causal graphs|Urs and I]] wrote a paper a few years back, which essential starts with a [[directed graph]] and builds a [[ericforgy:differential envelope|graded differential algebra]], which in turn, specifies something that I would call a [[ericforgy:directed space|directed space (under construction)]]. I've been trying to understand this in the context of [[space and quantity]] as stated [[ericforgy:HomePage|here]]. Seeing your entry gives me hope that all this can be tied together, but my maths chops are not quite up to the task of seeing it myself.

Skimming the paper, it looks like a directed space should have some interpretation in terms of [[poset|posets]] or [[preorder|preorders]], which in turn, could have some physical interpretation in terms of causality. Oh! Thank goodness for search functions. "Preorder" appears many times and this seems to be exactly the answer to a question I was going to ask...

Direction is quite different from orientation (1.3a); the links with ordering are more subtle. Various
$d$-spaces of interest derive from an ordinary space equipped with an order relation (1.4a), as in the
case of the _directed interval_ &#173;$\uparr\text{I} =\uparr [0, 1]$; or, more generally, from a space equipped with a _local preorder_ (1.4b), as for the directed circle &#173;$\uparr\mathbf{S}_1$.

This might help with a conjecture of mine I've been throwing around. Just as a smooth manifold can be triangulated, a directed space can be _diamondated_, i.e. discretized with directed cubes, so that it is locally cubic with a preferred directed. I THINK what I've been after might be consider a finitary/countable version of this notion of directed space.

Any thoughts to help me sort this out would be greatly appreciated.

If it would help I could cooperate on something for the nlab on this.
