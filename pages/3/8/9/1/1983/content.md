* [[Ieke Moerdijk]], [[Gonzalo Reyes|Gonzalo E. Reyes]], _Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis_ Springer (1991)

# Overview #

The book constructs, describes and studies in detail  concrete [[smooth topos]] well-adapted models for [[synthetic differential geometry]].

The construction of the ([[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck]]-) [[topos]] of [[generalized smooth space]]s proceeds in two steps in the [[space and quantity]] yoga:

1. certain [[presheaf|copresheaves]] on Cartesian spaces -- the [[generalized smooth algebra]] -- are regarded as the [[nLab:space and quantity|quantities]] on smooth test spaces.

2. the [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the smooth test spaces thus defined (or on a certain subcategory of them) are the [[generalized smooth space]]s of this model.
