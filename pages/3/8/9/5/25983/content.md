## Idea

A _Lubin-Tate space_ is a space of [[deformations]] of a one-dimensional [[formal group]] of height $h$. One may also construct spaces $\mathcal{M}_{n}$ parametrizing deformations of formal groups with [[level structures]]. The "infinite-level" Lubin-Tate space $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$, also known as the _Lubin-Tate tower_ is some idea of "inverse limit" of these spaces (note that the inverse limit does not actually as a [[rigid analytic space]], see Lecture 2 of [#WeinsteinNotes](#WeinsteinNotes) for the definition of the Lubin-Tate tower on the level of points).

## Application to the local Langlands correspondence

As the infinite-level Lubin-Tate space has actions of the groups appearing in the statement of the [[local Langlands correspondence]] for $\GL_{n}$, it has applications to its proof. See also Theorem 7 in [#WeinsteinNotes](#WeinsteinNotes), which is originally due to Harris-Taylor.

## Generalizations

The infinite-level Lubin-Tate space is a special case of an infinite-level [[Rapoport-Zink space]] (see [#ScholzeWeinstein12](#ScholzeWeinstein12)).
