## Idea

A _Lubin-Tate space_ is a space of [[deformations]] of a one-dimensional [[formal group]] of height $h$. One may also construct spaces $\mathcal{M}_{n}$ parametrizing deformations of formal groups with [[level structures]]. The "infinite-level" Lubin-Tate space $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$, also known as the _Lubin-Tate tower_ is some idea of "inverse limit" of these spaces (note that the inverse limit does not actually as a [[rigid analytic space]], see Lecture 2 of [#WeinsteinNotes](#WeinsteinNotes) for the definition of the Lubin-Tate tower on the level of points).
