An algebraic structure is here taken in a traditional sense as a set $S$ with a (not necessarily finite) number of operations $\alpha$ of various arity and satisfying some axioms (not necessarily of first order).  That is, we are discussing objects of an [[equationally presentable category|equationally presentable]] or [[algebraic category]].

An __$\Omega$-group__ is an algebraic structure which amounts to a [[group]] (usually written additively but not necessarily commutative) together with a set $\Omega$ of operations of any arity, such that for each $n$-ary operation $\alpha\in \Omega$, the distributivity in each variable holds:

$$\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_j+y_j,\ldots,x_n)=
\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_n)+\alpha(x_1,\ldots,y_j,\ldots,x_n)$$

The classical examples are of course groups and [[rings]], but also [[modules]] over a fixed ring: each element of the [[ground ring]] is a unary operation. An older term __group with operators__ is traditionally used for $\Omega$-groups when only unary operations/operators are considered. The general theory of $\Omega$-groups is similar to the basics of group and ring theory, including ideals, quotient $\Omega$-groups, isomorphism theorems, etc. For example, the Jordan--Holder theorem holds: if there is a composition series, then every two composition series are equivalent up to permutation of factors. An obvious horizontal categorification of $\Omega$-groups is also interesting. 

Note that $\Omega$ is a capital Greek letter; $\omega$-[[infinity-group|group]] is rather a synonym for (for some people strict) $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] with a single object, hence nothing to do with $\Omega$-groups.
