In the setup of [[topological spaces]], it is sometimes useful to restrict to a subclass of [[homotopy|homotopies]] which start as [[constant function|constant maps]]. 

More precisely, for $I = [0,1]$ the [[unit interval]], a [[continuous map]] $F:X\times I\to Y$ is a **delayed homotopy** if there exist $t_0\gt 0$ such that $F(x,t)=F(x,0)$ for all $0\leq t\leq t_0$. 

The delayed homotopies appear in an alternative characterization of [[Dold fibration]]s.
