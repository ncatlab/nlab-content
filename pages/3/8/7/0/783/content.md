French mathematician __Alexandre Grothendieck__, (in English usually Alexander Grothendieck), has created a work whose influence has shown him to be the greatest pure mathematician of the 20th century; and  his ideas continue to be developed in this century. 

Initially working in Topological vector spaces and analysis, he then made revolutionary advances in algebraic geometry, documented in the SGA volumes, the account of the seminars at the IHES, Bures-sur-Yvette, where he was based at the time. (See the wikipedia article (link below) for some indication of the stroy from there until the early 1980s.)

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Grothendieck wrote several documents that have been of outstanding importance in the origins of the theory that underlies the nPOV.  These include

* ''_La Longue Marche &#224; travers la Th&#233;orie de Galois'' (1600 manuscript pages written between January and June 1981, plus addenda etc which double its length!) (see [[Long March]] for some discussion of the ideas.)

* ''Esquisse d'un programme'', (January 1984), in which Grothendieck sketches out a vaste programme of research, encorporating many of the ideas from [[Long March]]. A copy is available [here](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/EsquisseFr.pdf). It is discussed in brief at [[Grothendieck's Esquisse]].

*  ''&#192; la poursuite des Champs'' (also entitled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'').  
It starts with a short (12 page) letter to Quillen, dated 19 Feb. 1983, but then discusses a wide ranging vision of homotopy theory and its applicability to problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. 

*  ''[[Les DÃ©rivateurs]]'' (another 2000 page manuscript taking  up some of the themes in Pursuing Stacks, section 69) Dating from the end of 1990 and the start of 1991.





For a good account of his work, including work published in the 1980s, see the [English Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck).
