The influence of Alexander Grothendieck's work  has shown him to be  the greatest pure mathematician of the 20th century;  and  his ideas continue to be developed  in this century. 

For a good account of his work, including work published in the 1980s, see the [English Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck)
