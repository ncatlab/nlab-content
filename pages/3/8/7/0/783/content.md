
The European mathematician __Alexander Grothendieck__ (in French sometimes Alexandre Grothendieck), created a very influential body of work foundational for ([[algebraic geometry|algebraic]]) [[geometry]] but also for modern [[mathematics]] more generally. He is widely regarded as a singularly important figure of 20th century mathematics and his ideas continue to be highly influential in the 21st century.

Initially working on [[topological vector spaces]] and [[analysis]], Grothendieck then made revolutionary advances in [[algebraic geometry]] by developing [[sheaf and topos theory]] and [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] and formulating algebraic geometry in these terms ([[locally ringed spaces]], [[schemes]]). Later [[topos theory]] further developed independently and today serves as the foundation also for other kinds of [[geometry]]. Notably its [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinement to [[higher topos theory]] serves as the foundation for modern [[derived algebraic geometry]].

## Selected writings

Grothendieck's geometric work is documented in texts known as [[EGA]] (with [[Dieudonné]]), an early account [[FGA]], and the many volume account [[SGA]] of the seminars at l'IH&#201;S, Bures-sur-Yvette, where he was based at the time. (See the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck) for some indication of the story from there until the early 1980s.)

On [[fiber bundles]] and [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] [[Čech cohomology]]:

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]], *A General Theory of Fibre Spaces With Structure Sheaf*, University of Kansas, Report No. 4 (1955, 1958) &lbrack;[pdf](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Kansasnotes.pdf), [[Grothendieck-FibreSpaces.pdf:file]]&rbrack;


In the late 1970s and early 1980s Grothendieck wrote several documents that have been of outstanding importance in the origins of the theory that underlies the [[nPOV]].  These include

* _La Longue Marche &#224; travers la Th&#233;orie de Galois_ (1600 manuscript pages written between January and June 1981, plus addenda etc. which double its length!) (see [[Long March]] for some discussion of the ideas.)

* _[[Esquisse d'un programme]]_, (January 1984), in which Grothendieck sketches out a vaste programme of research, incorporating many of the ideas from [[Long March]]. A copy is available [here](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/EsquisseFr.pdf). It is discussed in brief at [[Esquisse d'un programme|Grothendieck's Esquisse]].

*  _&#192; la poursuite des Champs_ (also entitled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'').  
It starts with a short (12 page) letter to Quillen, dated 19 Feb. 1983, but then discusses a wide ranging vision of homotopy theory and its applicability to problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. 

*  _[[Les Dérivateurs]]_ (another 2000 page manuscript taking  up some of the themes in Pursuing Stacks, section 69) Dating from the end of 1990 and the start of 1991.

In the same time he also wrote voluminous intellectual memoirs _Récoltes et Semailles_.

## Quotes
 {#Quotes}

On [[K-theory]]:

> The way I first visualized a K-group was as a group of "classes of objects" of an abelian (or more generally, additive) category, such as coherent sheaves on an algebraic variety, or vector bundles, etc. I would presumably have called this group $C(X)$ ($X$ being a variety or any other kind of "space"), $C$ the initial letter of 'class', but my past in functional analysis may have prevented this, as $C(X)$ designates also the space of continuous functions on $X$ (when $X$ is a topological space). Thus, I reverted to $K$ instead of $C$, since my mother tongue is German, Class = Klasse (in German), and the sounds corresponding to $C$ and $K$ are the same.

from a letter to Bruce Magurn (9th February 1985) quoted after:

* {#Bak87} A. Bak: *Editorial*, K-theory **1** 1 (1987) &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/BF00533984](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00533984)&rbrack;

On [[mathematical structure]]:

> If there is one thing in mathematics that fascinates me more than anything else (and doubtless always has), it is neither "number" nor "size", but above all "form". And among the thousand and one faces that form chooses in presenting itself to our attention, the one that has fascinated me more than any other, and continues to fascinate me, is the structure buried within mathematical objects.

from *[[Récoltes et semailles]]*, [here](https://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/lisker1.pdf#page=64).

On the phrase "[general abstract nonsense](category+theory#AbstractNonsense)":

> The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept
was general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around to take such childish steps...

from a letter to [[Ronald Brown]] (5 May 1982), [here](https://csg.igrothendieck.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/U24d.pdf#page=11).
