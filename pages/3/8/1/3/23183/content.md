## Definition

\begin{definition}
  For $G$ a [[finite group]], its *Artin-Lam induction exponent* is the [[minimum]] $e(G)$ among [[positive numbers|positive]] [[natural numbers]] such that the $e(G)$-dimensional [[trivial representation]] is in the [[ideal]] of the [[rational number|rational]] [[representation ring]] of $G$ which is generated by $G$-representations that are [[induced representation|induced]] by [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroups]] of $G$.
