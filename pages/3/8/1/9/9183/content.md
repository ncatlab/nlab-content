## Idea

The [[observable universe]] at large scales seems to behave as if it contains large amount of [[matter]] which does have a [[gravity|gravitational effect]] but does not emit [[electromagnetic radiation]] and hence remains "dark" to telescopes. This hypothetical matter is therefore called _dark matter_.

There are various astronomical observations that suggest the existence of dark matter

1. galaxy rotation curves -- the speed of rotation of [[galaxies]] as a function of the distance from their center cannot be explained by the observed visible matter, but an explanation of this dependence by gravitating matter requires the presence of plenty of dark matter;

1. cosmic microwave background fluctuations -- the measured fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]] are very well fitted by the [[standard model of cosmology]] with cold dark matter (CDM) included. (see also [Resonaances, 18 Jan 2013](#Resonaances)).

1. Simulations of [[structure formation]] in the universe seem to require existence of dark matter in order to reproduce results compatible with observation.

Any further details about the nature of this hypothetical dark matter remain elusive to date. Possible classes of candidates go by various names. For instance "[[weakly interacting massivle particle|weakly interacting massive particles]]" ("[[WIMP]]"s), hence massive particles that interact via [[gravity]] and the [[weak nuclear force]], but not via [[electromagnetism]].
Certain [[neutrino]]-dark matter scenarios are being discussed ([Neutrino White 16](#NeutrinoWhite16))
 In [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[theory (physics)|theories]] with [[R-parity]] imposed, the _lightest supersmmetric particle_ (LSP, such as the [[gravitino]] or the [[neutralino]]) is traditionally regarded as a natural candidate for dark matter ([EHNOS 84](#EHNOS84), reviewed in [Ellis-Olive 10](#EllisOlive10)).

## On galactic scales
 {#Properties}

The cold dark matter paradigm always worked excellently on cosmic scales, while seemingly facing problems with reproducing various observations on the scale of [[galaxies]]. But various recent computer simulations (e.g. with [FIRE](structure+formation#ReferencesFIRE), see the references [below](#ReferencesComputerSimulation)) point to these problems all going away when the complex dynamics of star-formation feedback/back-reaction on galactic [[structure formation]] (see there for more) is taken into account. We discuss this for:

1. _[The cusp-core behaviour](#CuspCoreProblem)_

1. _[Galactic rotation profiles](#GalacticRotationCurves)_

1. _[Missing satellites](#MissingSatellites)_

### Cusp-core behaviour
 {#CuspCoreProblem}

Early numerical simulation of dark matter exhibited dark matter halos around galaxies with a sharp density maximum at the center of the galaxy -- called a "cusp" in the density profile -- while observation on actual galaxies tends to favour a noticeably smoother density distribution at the center -- called a "core" of the density profile.

This discrepancy between [[theory (physics)|theory]] and [[experiment]] is (or was) known as the _cusp-core problem_ for dark matter [[model (physics)|models]] (see the references [below](#ReferencesCoreCuspProblem)). It is (or was) one of several issues that the dark matter model has (or had) on the scale of galaxies and smaller.

There are two potential resolutions to this problem: a) Either dark matter is more "exotic" than assumed in these simulations, such as being [[fuzzy dark matter]] or similar. Or, b), more mundanely, the existing simulations do not properly resolve a subtle effect shown already by more ordinary dark matter.

Recent investigations support possibility b), indicating that the density cusps seen in previous simulations are but an artifact of overly simplified numerical models, and that would-be cusps are diluted and hence smoothed out by bursty star formation leading to dark matter heating ([Pontzen-Governato 14](#PontzenGovernato14), [Read-Walker-Steger-18](#ReadWalkerSteger18)) and/or by dynamical friction in the interstallar medium ([ESH 01](#ESH01)). See [Read 19](#Read19) for review.


From [[Justin Read]] [22 Aug 2018](https://twitter.com/ReadDark/status/1032176578808168448) on [Read-Walker-Steger 18](#ReadWalkerSteger18):

> On large scales, the [[standard model of cosmology|standard cosmological model]] (LCDM) gives an excellent description of the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[radiation]] and the [[structure formation|growth of structure]]. However, on small scales, in our cosmic backyard known as the Local Group, there have been long-standing puzzles.  The oldest of these is the “cusp-core” problem. Gas rich dwarf galaxies have much less dark matter (DM) in their inner regions than early numerical models predicted. This could point to more exotic DM models, or to a failure of the cosmological model.

> However, there is a simpler solution. The early numerical models, above, considered a universe that contains only DM. Recent models that include gas cooling, star formation, and gas blow-out due to exploding stars find that star formation in dwarfs is bursty.

> This bursty star formation occurs due to repeated cycles of gas inflow and outflow. These cause the inner gravitational potential of the dwarf galaxy to fluctuate, kinematically "heating up" the dark matter and lowering its inner density ([Pontzen-Governato 14](#PontzenGovernato14)).

>  A key prediction of such models is that, at a fixed dark matter halo mass, more star formation leads to more dark matter "heating" and, therefore, a lower inner dark matter density, at least in dwarf galaxies. This is the prediction we set out to test in [Read-Walker-Steger 18](#ReadWalkerSteger18).

### Galactic rotation profile
 {#GalacticRotationCurves}

Computer simulation ([FIRE](https://fire.northwestern.edu)) of [[galaxy|galactic]] [[structure formation]] using the [[standard model of cosmology|standard]] [[cold dark matter]] [[model (physics)|model]] qualitatively reproduces the peculiar [[galactic rotation curves]] that motivated dark matter (or [[MOND]], for that matter) in the first place ([Hopkins et al. 17, Figure 4, Figure 5](#Hopkins17)):

and also reproduces well the baryonic [[Tully-Fisher relation]] ([El-Badry et al. 18, Figure 4](#ElBadry18)) which used to be an issue in the [[standard model of cosmology|standard]] [[cold dark matter]] [[model (physics)|model]]:

  "width": 500
\end{imagefromfile}
\end{center}

> graphics grabbed from ([El-Badry et al. 18](#ElBadry18))

More in detail, [[galaxy rotation curves]] exhibit a close correlation between [[angular velocity]] and total _visible_ enclosed math at any given [[radius]], called the _[[radial acceleration relation]]_ (RAR) or _[[mass-discrepancy acceleration relation]]_. This, too, is reproduced in [[cold dark matter]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)]]  computer simulation ([Santos-Santos et al. 15](#SantosSantosEtAl15), [Cintio-Lelli 15](#CintioLelli15), [Keller-Wadsley 16](#KellerWadsley16), [Ludlow et al 16](#LudlowEtAl16)). These early simulations were not found conclusive in [Lelli et al 16, section 8.2](#LelliEtAl16). But more detailed analysis ([PSF 18](#PSF18)) and more refined simulation ([Dutton-Maccio-Obreja-Buck 19](#DuttonMaccioObrejaBuck19)) has then been claimed to confirm the statement.

A conceptual explanation of the mechanism by stellar feedback is discussed in [GBFH 19](#GBFH19).

### Evidence
 {#Evidence}

Evidence for dark matter on large cosmic scales is extremely strong, see the above reviews (...). Evidence on smaller scales, starting around the scale of galaxies is problematic, see the above reviews (...). In particular, as yet there is no direct detection of any dark matter particle.

(...)



Outlook on prospect of direct detection of dark matter, as of 2018:

* Gianfranco Bertone, Tim M. P. Tait, _A New Era in the Quest for Dark Matter_, Nature volume 562, pages 51–56 (2018)  ([arXiv:1810.01668](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01668))

Argument that dark matter has already be seen across a range of direct detection experiments, but mis-interpreted as noise, due to negligence of the possibility of [[inelastic scattering|inelastic]] [[plasmon]] excitations in [[crystal|crystalline]] detector materials:

* {#KBKK20} Noah Kurinsky, Daniel Baxter, Yonatan Kahn, Gordan Krnjaic, _A Dark Matter Interpretation of Excesses in Multiple Direct Detection Experiments_ ([arXiv:2002.06937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06937))

> The result of [Kurinsky et al.](#KBKK20) should not be taken as evidence for dark matter, although it does highlight the ongoing need to investigate the effect of collective modes how [sic] we detect radiation.
