Robert Gilmer (1938  - 2021) was a Mathematics Professor at Florida State University with many contributions in [[commutative algebra]].

From *Multiplicative Ideal Theory in Commutative Algebra, 
A Tribute to the Work of Robert Gilmer (2006)*:

"For over forty years, Robert Gilmerâ€™s numerous articles and books have had a tremendous impact on research in commutative algebra. It is not an exaggeration to say that most articles published today in non-Noetherian ring theory, and some in Noetherian ring theory as well, originated in a topic that Gilmer either initiated or enriched by his work."
