it says:

> "For over forty years, Robert Gilmerâ€™s numerous articles and books have had a tremendous impact on research in commutative algebra. It is not an exaggeration to say that most articles published today in non-Noetherian ring theory, and some in Noetherian ring theory as well, originated in a topic that Gilmer either initiated or enriched by his work."
