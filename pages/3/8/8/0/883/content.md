A __comparison__ on a set $A$ is a (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on $A$ such that in every pair of related elements, any other element is related to one of the original elements in the same order as the original pair:
$$\forall (x, y, z: A),\; x \sim z \;\Rightarrow\; x \sim y \;\vee\; y \sim z$$
which generalises from $3$ to any (finite, positive) number of elements.  To include the case where $n = 0$, we must explicitly state that the relation is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]].

Comparisons are most often studied in [[constructive mathematics]].
