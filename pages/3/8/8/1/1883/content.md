If [[group cohomology]] studies $[K(A, n), K(B, m)]$, usually in the case $n = 1$, one might imagine **group homotopy** would study $[M(A, n), M(B, m)]$, especially for $m = 1$, where the $M(A, n)$ are Moore spaces.

One difference is that $K(G, 1)$ is defined for nonabelian $G$, whereas $M(G, 1)$ is only defined for abelian $G$. (An asymmetry in the structure and co-structure of the circle?)

According to Baues, the groups $[M(A, n), M(B, m)]$ are not at all understood. This is clear, since for $A = B = \mathbb{Z}$, these are the homotopy groups of the spheres.

Need to say something about homology decomposition and homotopy decomposition (see Baues, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xoM5DxQZihQC">Homotopy Types</a>. Homology decomposition fails to be natural, but Baues introduces 'boundary invariants' which are natural.
