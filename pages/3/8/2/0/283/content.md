A notion of _$\infty$-topos_ is a generalization of that of [[topos]] to [[higher category theory]].

If by $\infty$-category one means an $(\infty,\infty)$-category, then such a notion is still undefined.  However, nowadays many people write "$\infty$-category" to mean what here on the nLab we usually still call an [[(∞,1)-category]], and thus an "$\infty$-topos" means an [[(∞,1)-topos]].  See also [[higher topos theory]] for more.
