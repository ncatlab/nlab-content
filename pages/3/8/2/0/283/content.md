To date there only exists a definition of $(\infty,1)$-topos:
* Jacob Lurie, _Higher Topos Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040))

Note that just as the $\infty$-category of sets is a [[topos]] (that is a $(1,1)$-topos), so the $\infty$-category of $n$-categories is an $(n+1,1)$-topos. In particular, the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories is an $(\infty,1)$-topos.
