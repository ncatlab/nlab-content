The **K-theory spectrum** in the strict sense is the [[spectrum]] that represents the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory [[topological K-theory]]. For complex [[topological K-theory]] this is periodic with period 2 (reflect Bott periodicity) of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z} \times B U ,\; U ,\; \cdots
  \,.
$$

More generally, to every [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is associated a [[K-theory]] _space_ which in good cases, such as when the category is presented by a [[Waldhausen category]] is the degree 0 piece of a corresponding [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum. The detailed construction is known as the [[Waldhausen S-construction]].

[[Domenico Fiorenza]]: Is it possible to say that the K-theory spectrum is the Waldhausen construction on the stabilization of $Vect_{fin.dim.}$ (seen as an $(\infty,1)$-category)? Since $\mathbb{N}$ is the decategorification of $Vect_{fin.dim.}$ by taking dimension, one can expect a map of spectra induced by $dim$, and this could be cojecturally be the Chern character at a spectra level (the fact that the leading therm of $Ch$ is $dim$ seems to support this point of view). I'll try to exand this on my personal area.
