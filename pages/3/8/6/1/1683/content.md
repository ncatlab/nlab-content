## Idea

The **K-theory spectrum** $KU$ (for complex K-theory) or $KO$ (for orthogonal K-theory) in the strict sense is the [[spectrum]] that represents the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory [[topological K-theory]]. For complex [[topological K-theory]] this is periodic with period 2 (reflect Bott periodicity) of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z} \times B U ,\; U ,\; \cdots
  \,.
$$

More generally, to every [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is associated a [[K-theory]] _space_ which in good cases, such as when the category is presented by a [[Waldhausen category]] is the degree 0 piece of a corresponding [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum. The detailed construction is known as the [[Waldhausen S-construction]].

## Properties

### As a localization of an $\infty$-group $\infty$-ring

[[Snaith's theorem]] asserts that the [[K-theory spectrum]] for [[periodic complex K-theory]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[circle 2-group]] localized away from the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

$$
  KU \simeq \mathbb{S}[B U(1)][\beta^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

### Homotopy fixed points and $KR$-theory

[[complex conjugation|Complex conjugation]] on [[complex vector bundles]] induces on the [[complex K-theory]] [[spectrum]] $KU$ an [[involution|involutive]] [[automorphism]]. [[KR-theory]] is the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology]] theory. 

In particular, the [[homotopy fixed point]] of [[KU]] under this automorphism is [[KO]]

$$
  KO \simeq (KU)^{\mathbb{Z}/2}
$$

and this way where in complex K-theory one has [[KU]]-[[modules]] ([[∞-modules]]), so in KR-theory one has $KO$-modules.
