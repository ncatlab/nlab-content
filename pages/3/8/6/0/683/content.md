# Idea #

In great generality, a _homotopy limit_ is a way of constructing appropriate sorts of [[limit]]s in a [[higher category theory|(weak) higher category]] using some "presentation" of that higher category by a stricter structure.  The general study of such presentations is [[homotopy theory]].

In classical homotopy theory, the presentation is given by a [[category with weak equivalences]], possibly satisfying extra axioms such as those of a [[homotopical category]], a [[category of fibrant objects]], or a [[model category]].  Such structures are considered to present an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], and homotopy limits give a way of constructing the appropriate sort of "$(\infty,1)$-limits" in an $(\infty,1)$-category.

In [[enriched homotopy theory]], the presentation is given by an [[enriched model category]] or an [[enriched homotopical category]], and it presents an "enriched $(\infty,1)$-category."  Here the appropriate notion is a [[weighted limit|weighted]] homotopy limit, which is expected to construct "weighted $(\infty,1)$-limits" in the presented "enriched $(\infty,1)$-category."  Note that as yet, no fully general notion of "enriched $(\infty,1)$-category" exists; see [[homotopical enrichment]].

As a special case of enriched homotopy theory, we may consider model categories or homotopical categories that are enriched over a notion of $n$-category as presentations for $(n+1)$-categories.  (Here we allow $n$ to also be of the form [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)]], with the obvious convention that $(n,r)+1 = (n+1,r+1)$ and $\infty+1=\infty$.)  For example:

* [[simplicial set]]s are models for $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] ($(\infty,0)$-categories), so [[simplicial model category|simplicial model categories]] are presentations for $(\infty,1)$-categories.  Of course, arbitrary model categories are also presentations for $(\infty,1)$-categories, but simplicial model categories are easier to work with, and in particular easier to construct homotopy limits in.

* A [[Cat]]-enriched category is just a [[strict 2-category]], so a [[model 2-category]] or [[homotopical 2-category]] is a presentation of a weak [[2-category]] (or [[bicategory]]).  Homotopy limits in a model 2-category give presentations of [[2-limit]]s (bilimits) in its homotopy 2-category.

* A $(2Cat,\otimes_{Gray}$)-enriched category is a [[Gray-category]], and a [[model Gray-category]] or [[homotopical Gray-category]] is a presentation of a weak [[3-category]] (or [[tricategory]]).  Homotopy limits in a model Gray-category may be expected give presentations of [[3-limit]]s in its homotopy 3-category, although this has not been proven since the general theory of 3-limits is fairly nonexistent.


# Definitions #

There are two ways to define homotopy limits:

* with explicit constructions that satisfy a "local" universal property: the homotopy limit object "represents homotopy-coherent cones up to homotopy."

* as [[derived functor]]s that satisfy a "global" universal property: the homotopy limit _functor_ is "universal among homotopical approximations to the strict limit functor."

One of the central theorems of the subject is that in good cases, the two give equivalent results.  This is sort of a folk theorem, especially in classical contexts.  One fairly general statement and proof, in modern language, can be found in

### Global definition ###

Let $C$ be a [[category with weak equivalences]] and let $D$ be a (small) category.  Make the [[functor category]] $[D,C]$ into a category with weak equivalences by taking the weak equivalences to be those [[natural transformation]]s which are objectwise weak equivalences in $C$.

The **homotopy limit** of a functor $F : D \to C$ is the image of $F$ under the right [[derived functor]], if it exists, of the [[limit]] functor $lim_D : [D,C] \to C$ with respect to the given weak equivalences on $C$ and the objectwise weak equivalences on $[D,C]$:
$$
  holim_D F := (R lim_D)F
  \,.
$$
In the enriched case, this must be suitably modified to deal with [[weighted limit|weighted limits]] as well as enrichment of both $C$  and $D$.


### Local definition ##

This definition is rather more complicated, but rather more intuitive.  It requires making precise the notion of a _[[homotopy]] commutative cone_ over a diagram; one then defines the homotopy limit $L$ of a functor $F:D\to C$ to be a representing object for such cones, in the sense that we have a (weak) equivalence
$$ Map(X,L) \simeq HoCones(X,F)$$
of hom-objects (spaces or simplicial sets in the classical context; enriched hom-objects in the enriched context).


# Comparisons #

### Global versus local ##

The global definition is formulated in terms of _weak equivalences_ only, while the local definition is formulated in terms of _[[homotopy|homotopies]]_ only.  However, in practical cases, derived functors exist because their input objects (in this case, the diagram $F$) can be replaced by "good" (fibrant and/or cofibrant) objects in such a way that weak equivalences become _homotopy_ equivalences.  The derived functor of $lim$ at the input object $F$ is then computed by applying the ordinary functor $lim$ to a good replacement $R F$ of $F$.

It then turns out that the "good" (precisely, "fibrant") replacement $R F$ "builds in" precisely the right homotopies so that an ordinary cone over $R F$ is the same as a homotopy-commutative cone over $F$.  Therefore, $lim (R F)$, which is the global homotopy-limit of $F$, is a representing object for homotopy-commutative cones over $F$, and thus is also a local homotopy-limit of $F$.  There is a dual argument for colimits using cofibrant replacements.

Formal versions of this argument can be found in many places; see the references below.


### Homotopy limits versus higher categorical limits

If $C$ is a category enriched over $(n-1)$-categories and we are considering it to _be_ an $n$-category, it is natural to define a "weak equivalence" in the underlying ordinary category of $C$ to a morphism that is an $n$-categorical [[equivalence]].  We call this the _natural_ or _trivial_ homotopical structure on $C$.  In certain cases (such as $n=2)$ it can be made into a model structure, also called _natural_ or _trivial_.

Since higher categorical limits are generally defined as representing objects for cones that commute up to [[equivalence]], it is unsurprising that if $C$ has a natural homotopical structure, (locally defined) homotopy limits and $n$-limits coincide.  For $n=1$ this is trivial.  For $n=2$ it is proven in the paper of Gambino referenced below (particularly section 6).  For $n=(\infty,1)$ it is proven in (among other places) Lurie's book, section 4.2.4.  The case $n=3$ ought to be approachable in theory, but doesn't seem to have been done.

On the other hand, we may also consider a category $C$ enriched over $n$-categories with a _larger_ class of weak equivalences than just the $n$-categorical equivalences.  Then $C$ presents an $n$-category (its "homotopy $n$-category") obtained by formally turing these weak equivalences into $n$-categorical equivalences.  Homotopy limits in $C$ with this homotopical structure should then present $n$-limits in its homotopy $n$-category.  In the case $n=(\infty,1)$ this is also essentially in Lurie's book; for other values of $n$ it may not be in the literature.


# Examples #

## Homotopy pullbacks ##

Let $D = \{ 1\to 0 \leftarrow 2\}$ be the pullback [[diagram]], so that limits over it compute [[pullback]]s, and assume that $F : D \to C$ is such that
$$
  F(1) \to F(0) \leftarrow F(2)
$$
satisfies
* $F(i)$ is fibrant for all $i$;
* and either $F(1) \to F(0)$ or $F(2) \to F(0)$ is a fibration;

then

* $holim_D F$ exists;
* and is weakly equivalent to the ordinary limit $holim_D F \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} lim_D F$.

Conversely this means that on an arbitrary pullback diagram  $holim_D F$ can be computed by finding a natural transformation $F \Rightarrow R F$ whose component morphisms are weak equivalences and such that $R F$ satisfies the above conditions.


###Based loop objects as homotopy limits###

Let $C$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]]. Then for $B$ any [[pointed object]] with point $pt \stackrel{pt_B}{\to} B$ we have

$$
  holim(  pt \stackrel{pt_B}{\to}  B \stackrel{pt_B}{\leftarrow} pt)
  \;\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\;
  \Omega_{pt} B
  \,,
$$
where $\Omega_{pt} B$ is the based [[loop space object]] of $B$.

This follows from the above prescription by noticing that the [[generalized universal bundle]] $\mathbf{E}_{pt} B$ provides a fibrant replacement of the pullback diagram in that we have

$$
  \array{
     pt &\to& B &\leftarrow& pt
     \\
     \downarrow^{\simeq} && \downarrow^{Id} && \downarrow^{Id}
     \\
    \mathbf{E}_{pt}B &\to& B &\leftarrow& pt
  }
$$

with all vertical morphisms weak equivalences and with the left bottom horizontal morphism a fibration.


### Homotopy pullback of a point over a group / universal bundles ##

As a special case of the above general example we get the following.

Let $C =$ [[Grpd]] equipped with the [[folk model structure]]. Write $G$ for a [[group]] regarded as a discrete monoidal groupoid (elements of $G$ are the objects of the groupoids and all morphisms are identities) write and $\mathbf{B}G$ for the corresponding one-object [[groupoid]] (single object, one morphism per element of $G$). Write $pt$ for the terminal groupoid (one object, no nontrivial morphism). 
Notice that there is a unique functor $pt \to \mathbf{B}G$.
Then we have
$$
  holim
  \left(
    \array{
       && pt
       \\
       && \downarrow
       \\
       pt &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  G
  \,.
$$
To see this, we compute using the above prescription by finding a weakly equivalent pullback diagram such that one of its morphisms is a fibration. This is achived in particular by the [[generalized universal bundle]]
$pt \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{E}G \to\gt \mathbf{B}G$, where $\mathbf{E}G$ is the [[action groupoid]] $G//G$ of $G$ 
acting on itself by multiplication from one side. So we have a weak equivalence of pullback diagrams
$$
  \array{
     pt &\to& \mathbf{B}G &\leftarrow& pt
     \\
     \downarrow^{\simeq} && \downarrow^= &&
     \downarrow^= 
     \\
     \mathbf{E}G &\to\gt& \mathbf{B}G &\leftarrow& pt 
  }
$$
and the homotopy limit in question is weakly equivalent to the ordinary limit over the lower diagram. That is directly seen to be $Disc(Obj(\mathbf{E}G)) = Disc(Obj(G//G)) = Disc(G)$ which we just write as $G$:
$$
  holim 
  \left(
    \array{
       && pt
       \\
       && \downarrow
       \\
       pt &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  lim
  \left(
    \array{
       && pt
       \\
       && \downarrow
       \\
       \mathbf{E}G &\to\gt& \mathbf{B}G
    }
  \right)  
  = G
  \,.
$$
This example is important in the context of [[groupoidification]] and [[geometric function theory]], as described there.

### Homotopy pullback of a subgroup over a group ###

The above example generalizes straightforwardly
to the case where the trivial 
inclusion $pt \to \mathbf{B}G$ is replaced by any inclusion  $\mathbf{B}H \hookrightarrow \mathbf{B}G$ of any subgroup $H$ of $G$ pretty much literally by replacing $pt$ by $\mathbf{B}H$ throughout. 

One finds

$$
  holim\left(
   \array{
     && \mathbf{B}H
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{B}H &\to& \mathbf{B}G
   }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  H \backslash\backslash G//H
$$

where on the right we have the [[action groupoid]] of $H \times H$ acting on $G$ by multiplication from the left (first factor) and the right (second factor).

To see this, we again build a fibrant replacement of the pullback diagram. Following the constructions at [[generalized universal bundle]] consider first the groupoid $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H}G$ given by the pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H}G &\to& \mathbf{B}H
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    [I, \mathbf{B}G] &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow^{d_1} 
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

As at [[generalized universal bundle]] one proves that the left vertical morphism
$\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H}G \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a fibration.

Now, notice (which was implicit in the above example) that since $[I,\mathbf{B}G]$ is a [[path object]] in a [[category of fibrant objects]] we have a [[section]]
$
  \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}^\sigma  [I, \mathbf{B}G] 
$
of $[I,\mathbf{B}G] \stackrel{d_0}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$. In the above pullback diagram this induces a morphism 
$
  \mathbf{B}H \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H}G
$ 
making the obvious diagram commute. Now, the latter morphism, being the pullback of an acyclic fibration is an acyclic fibration, so its right inverse $\sigma$ is a weak equivalence. This way we obtain the morphism of pullback diagrams

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}H &\to& \mathbf{B}G &\leftarrow& \mathbf{B}H
    \\
    {}^\simeq\downarrow^{\sigma} && \downarrow^{Id} 
     && \downarrow^{Id} 
    \\
    \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H}G &\to \gt& \mathbf{B}G &\leftarrow& \mathbf{B}H
  }
$$
which is objectwise a weak equivalence and such that the horizontal morphism on the bottom left is a fibration. By the above statement the ordinary limit of the lower horizontal diagram is weakly equivalent to the homotopy limit we are looking for. But this is manifestly the desired action groupoid:

$$
  holim\left(
   \array{
     && \mathbf{B}H
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{B}H &\to& \mathbf{B}G
   }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \lim\left(
   \array{
     && \mathbf{B}H
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{B}H} G &\to& \mathbf{B}G
   }
  \right)
  \simeq
  \lim\left(
   \array{
     && [I,\mathbf{B}G]
     \\
     && \downarrow^{d_0 \times d_1}
     \\
     \mathbf{B}H \times \mathbf{B}H 
     &\to& \mathbf{B}G \times \mathbf{B}G
   }
  \right)
  =
  H \backslash\backslash G//H
  \,.
$$

This example, too, is important at [[geometric function theory]].

+--{.query}
[[Tim Porter|Tim]]  Mike, are you intending to treat the case of when the domain category, $D$ is the above, is enriched as well? This would handle the example of homotopy limts of homotopy coherent diagrams, both in Vogt's sense and in the simplicially enriched case looked at by Bourn and Cordier. This would also allow the $G$ in one of the examples to be a simplicial or topological group, or to be (?) and A-infinity category. (Some of those examples may be already dealt with in others of the entries as different people classify things in different ways.)

Perhaps some of the more classical referencs, Vogt, Bousfield-Kan etc. might be included for completeness.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Yes, certainly; my paper referenced above deals with the case when $D$ is enriched as well.  There are cofibrancy technicalities, of course.  I'm not against including the classical references, although I find them fairly impenetrable myself.
