A [[functor]] $C \to Set$ is **corepresentable** if it is ([[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) a functor of the form $Hom_C(c,-)$ for some [[object]] $c\in C$.

This is equivalently a [[representable functor]] defined on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.  Often no terminological distinction is made between representable and corepresentable ones (both being called simply "representable"), since a functor $C\to Set$ can only be "corepresentable" while a functor $C^{op}\to Set$ can only be "representable".
