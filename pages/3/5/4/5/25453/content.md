## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], what is known as the *variable rule* (or *projection rule*) is the [[structural rule|structural]] [[inference rule]] which, informally speaking, asserts for any [[dependent type]] $A$ the apparent [[tautology]] that "given a variable $a \colon A$" (as a [[hypothesis]]/[[antecedent]]) "then we have that variable $a \colon A$" (as a [[succedent]]).

$$
  VAR
  \frac{
    \Gamma
    \;\;\;\;
    \vdash
    \;\;\;\;
    A \colon Type
  }{
    \Gamma
    ,\;
    a \colon A
    \;\;\;\;
    \vdash
    \;\;\;\;
    a \colon A
  }
$$

As usual in [[dependent type theory]], the meaning of this rule is a little less trivial than it may superficially seem by the generic [[dependent type|type dependency]] involved: In the [[antecedent]] the variable may be picked out of a [[context]] [[type telescope|telescope]], and in the [[succedent]] it is implicitly [[weakening rule|weakened]] to depend on that full context, -- which includes $a \colon A$ itself! 

Accordingly, the [[categorical semantics]] [[categorical semantics of dependent types|as dependent types]] of the variable rule is given by the [[diagonal]] morphism on the [[object]] interpreting $A$, regarded as a [[section]] of the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of the [[bundle]]/[[display map]] $A \to \Gamma$ to its own total space:
