## Idea

A [[duality in string theory]]. The [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] enhancement of [[duality between heterotic and type II string theory]]:

[[F-theory]]$\,$ "[[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]]" on an [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[K3]] with a [[section]] is supposed to be equivalent to [[heterotic string theory]] [[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]] on a [[2-torus]]. 

More generally, [[F-theory]] on a [[complex manifold|complex]] $n$-dimensional $X$ fibered $X\to B$ with elliptic [[K3]]-[[fibers]] is supposed to be equivalent to [[heterotic string theory]] on an [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[Calabi-Yau manifold]] $Z \to B$ of [[complex manifold|complex]] [[dimension]] $(n-1)$.

A detailed discussion of the [[equivalence]] of the respective [[moduli spaces]] is originally due to ([Friedman-Morgan-Witten 97](#FriedmanMorganWitten97)). A review of this is in ([Donagi 98](#Donagi98)).


From the abstract of ([Donagi 98](#Donagi98)).

> The [[heterotic string theory|heterotic string]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $(n-1)$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $Z \to B$ is conjectured to be [[duality in string theory|dual]] to [[F-theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $n$-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $X \to B$, fibered over the same base with [[elliptic fibration|elliptic]] [[K3]] fibers. In particular, the [[moduli]] of the two theories should be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. The cases most relevant to the physics are $n=2$, $3$, $4$, i.e. the [[KK-compactification|compactification]] is to [[dimensions]] $d=8$, $6$ or $4$ respectively. Mathematically, the richest picture seems to emerge for $n=3$, where the [[moduli space]] involves an analytically [[integrable system]] whose fibers admit rather different descriptions in the two theories.



## Aspects

### Singular locus of the elliptic fibration and 24 D7-branes
 {#SingularLocusAndD7Branes}

In passing from [[M-theory]] to [[type IIA string theory]], the locus of any [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]] in 11d becomes the locus of [[D6-branes]] in 10d. The locus of the [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]] in turn (as discussed there) is the locus where the $S^1_A$-circle fibration degenerates. Hence in F-theory this is the locus where the fiber of the $S^1_A \times S^1_B$-[[elliptic fibration]] degenerates to the [[nodal curve]]. Since the [[T-duality|T-dual]] of [[D6-branes]] are [[D7-branes]], it follows that [[D7-branes]] in F-theory "are" the singular locus of the elliptic fibration.

Now an [[elliptically fibered complex K3-surface]] 

$$
  \array{
    T &\longrightarrow& K3
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1
  }
$$

may be parameterized via the [[Weierstrass elliptic function]] as the solution locus of the equation

$$
  y^2 = x^3 + f(z) x + g(z)
$$

for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$, with $f$ a [[polynomial]] of degree 8 and $g$ of degree twelve. The [[j-invariant]] of the complex [[elliptic curve]] which this parameterizes for given $z$ is

$$
  j(\tau(z)) = \frac{4 (24 f)^3}{27 g^2 + 4 f^3} 
  \,.
$$

The [[poles]] $j\to \infty$ of the [[j-invariant]] correspond to the [[nodal curve]], and hence it is at these poles that the [[D7-branes]] are located.

\end{imagefromfile}

Since the order of the poles is 24 (the polynomial degree of the [[discriminant]] $\Delta = 27 g^2 + 4 f^3$, see at _[[elliptically fibered K3-surface]]  -- [singular points](elliptic+fibration+of+a+K3-surface#SingularPoints)_) there are necessarily _24 D7-branes_ ([Sen 96, page 5](#Sen96), [Sen 97b](#Sen97b), see also [Morrison 04, sections 8 and 17](#Morrison04), [Denef 08, around (3.41)](#Denef08), [Douglas-Park-Schnell 14](duality+between+M%2FF-theory+and+heterotic+string+theory#DouglasParkSchnell14)).

Under [[T-duality]] this translates to 24 [[D6-branes]] in [[type IIA string theory]] on [[K3]] ([Vafa 96, Footnote 2 on p. 6](#Vafa96)).

Notice that the _net charge_ of these 24 D7-branes is supposed to vanish, due to [[S-duality]] effects (e.g. [Denef 08, below (3.41)](#Denef08)).

(This reminds one of the situation for the [[third stable homotopy group of spheres]]...)

### Non-reducible heterotic $E_8$-gauge backgrounds
 {#NonReducibleHeteroticGaugeBackgrounds}

There are some [[F-theory]] backgrounds whose supposed dual in [[heterotic string theory]] involves an [[E8]]-[[principal connection]] which is not [[reduction of the structure group|reducible]] to [[SemiSpin(16)]] ([Distler-Sharpe 10, section 5](#DistlerSharpe10)), while in fact the traditional construction of the heterotic [[worldsheet]] theory only covers this case. In ([Distler-Sharpe 10, section 7-8](#DistlerSharpe10)) it is argued that therefore a more general formulation of [[heterotic string theory]] needs to involve [[parameterized WZW models]]. See also at _[heterotic string -- Properties -- General gauge backgrounds and parameterized WZW models](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/heterotic+string+theory#GeneralGaugeBackgroundsAndParameterizedWZWModels)_.
