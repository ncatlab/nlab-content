I am currently the Managing Director of a very small Computer Consultancy called PerceptiSys Ltd here in the UK.  

As an _engineer_, one of the aims of my little company is to build systems that _think_.  That is, systems that are capable of learning about and then reasoning about their _environment_.  

As a _mathematician_, I find that I require aspects of n-Category theory to be able to understand what the engineering should do.  Basically _systems that think_ (aka _Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beasties_ (Robert Burns' _To a Mouse_ November 1785)) need to keep track of how _spacetime_ is constructed from finite measurements and the results of past actions.

Given the deep moral implications of this work, another aim of my little company is to create an _open_ patent covering as much of this technology as possible. (Any suggestions on how to create _open_ patents would be most welcome!)

In my past life I have been, until 1996, an academic (research assistant with various academics) at the University of Warwick's Mathematics Institute.  I obtained my PhD under Anthony Manning in 1992 (for what it is worth, my mathematical genealogy can be found [here](http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=23941)). When the Berlin wall fell in 1989, there was such a surplus of _superb_ Mathematicians in my area, Dynamical Systems, coming from the old Soviet Block countries, that, in 1996, I decided, instead of moving my young family around the world, I would, instead, move into industry.
