## Statement

The Baum-Connes conjecture asserts that under suitable technical conditions, the [[operator K-theory]]/[[KK-theory]] of the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of an [[action groupoid|action]] [[topological groupoid]] $X//G$ is equivalent to the _$G$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]]_ [[topological K-theory]]/[[operator K-theory]]/[[KK-theory]] of $X$. Moreover, it says that this equivalences is exhibited by the _[[analytic assembly map]]_.
(Just the [[injective map|injectivity]] of this map is related to the [[Novikov conjecture]].)

The original version of the Baum-Connes conjecture ([Baum-Connes](#BaumConnes00)) stated for a suitable [[topological group]] $G$ that with $X = E G \simeq \ast$ the point incarnated as the $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] with its free $G$-[[action]] the [[analytic assembly map]] (the $G$-equivariant [[index]] map)

$$
  K_\bullet^G(E G) \stackrel{}{\to} K_\bullet(C(\mathbf{B}G))
  \,,
$$

from the $G$-equivariant $K$-theory of $E G$ to the [[operator K-theory]] of the [[group algebra]], hence the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of the [[delooping]] groupoid $\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast // G$, is an [[isomorphism]].

This Baum-Connes conjecture is known to be true for

* [[compact topological groups]],
* [[abelian groups]],
* [[Lie groups]] with finitely many [[connected components]];
* $p$-adic groups,
*  adelic groups.

It is not known if the conjecture is true for all [[discrete groups]].

Later the statement was generalized ([Tu 99](#Tu99)) to more general groupoids and to [[KK-theory]]
