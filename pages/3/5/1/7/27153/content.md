## Definition
A **dominion** is a [[category with display maps]] whose display maps are [[monomorphisms]] closed under [[composition]]. It can be considered a minimal setting in which [[partial maps]] can be defined.

## Relation to dominances

A [[dominance]] on $\Omega$ [[subobject classifier]] of a [[topos]] $C$ induces a dominion: the maps are the monics whose classifying maps factors through the dominance.
