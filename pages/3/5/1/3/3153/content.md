Configuration schemes are a generalization of schemes, which are obtained via formal gluing of usual schemes along closed embeddings. In fact, the categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] are glued. Standard cohomology theory and the study of coherent sheaves extend to them. The configuration schemes are thought of to provide a nonclassical type of resolution of singularities, and can be a part of a categorical version of resolution of singularities.
