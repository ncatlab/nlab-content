## Statement

In [[set theory]], the axiom of **dependent choice** (DC) states that if $X$ is a nonempty ([[inhabited set|inhabited]]) set and if $R$ is a [[entire relation|total]] binary relation on $X$, then there exists a sequence $x\colon \mathbb{N} \to X$ such that $(x_n, x_{n+1})$ belongs to $R$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. It is strictly weaker than the full [[axiom of choice]], but strictly stronger than the axiom of [[countable choice]]. It is called _dependent_ choice because the available choices for $x_{n+1}$ depend on the choice of $x_n$ made at the previous stage.


## Applications

Typical applications of dependent choice include [[KÅ‘nig's lemma]] and the [[Baire category theorem]] for [[complete metric spaces]].


## Acceptability

For a number of schools of [[constructive mathematics]], dependent choice is considered an acceptable alternative to full AC, and the principle holds (assuming that it holds in [[Set]]) in quite a few [[toposes]] of interest in which full AC doesn't hold, including all [[presheaf toposes]] and the [[effective topos]].  In fact, it follows from the stronger [[presentation axiom]], which holds in many of these toposes and also has a constructive justification.
