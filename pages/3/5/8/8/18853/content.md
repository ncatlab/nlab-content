## Idea

The _Lamb shift_ is a tiny shift in the [[energy]] spectrum of excitations of the [[electron]] orbits in the [[hydrogen atom]].

This is a "fine structure" effect not seen by the [[quantum mechanics]] of the [[electron]], but resulting from [[radiative corrections]] involving [[photon]] emission/absorption only seen by regarding the electron in [[perturbative quantum field theory]], here in [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The Lamb shift may be attributed to [[loop order|1-loop]] [[Feynman diagram]]-contributions giving "[[radiative corrections]]" to the basic [[tree level]] [[electron-photon vertex]] that describes the basic [[interaction]] of the [[electron]] with the [[background field|background]] [[electromagnetic field]], via the [[electron-photon vertex]], hence called _vertex corrections_ and governed by the [[coupling constant]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]], the _[[fine structure constant]]_.

(Here the dot on the right is the external vertex for the [[background field|background]] [[electromagnetic field]].)

The main contribution (often referred to as _the_ vertex correction) is due to the [[radiative correction]] induced by the [[electron]] emitting a [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[photon]], then interacting with the [[background field|background]] [[electromagnetic field]], and and finally re-absorbing the [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[photon]]; described by this [[Feynman diagram]]:

Historically, the observation of the Lamb shift in [[experiment]] catalyzed the theoretic development of [[quantum electrodynamics]] specifically and of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] generally.
