* [[William Lawvere]],

  _Toposes of laws of motion_ , 

  transcript of a talk in Montreal, Sept. 1997 

  ([pdf](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf))

on the formulation of [[differential equations]]/[[continuum mechanics]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Another early text in this direction is Lawvere's _[[Categorical dynamics]]_. Related texts on the [[foundations]] of [[physics]] in [[topos theory]] include the collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_.

An open question concerning the characterization of "Toposes of laws of motion" is raised as question 7 "The algebra of time" in

* _Open problems in topos theory_, April 2009 ([pdf](http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/pssl88/lawvere.pdf))


Entries with related discussion include _[[geometry of physics]]_ and _[[higher category theory and physics]]_.

## Laws of motion


p. 9 

> What, more precisely, do we mean by a 'law'? and how could the laws possibly form a topos as promised in my title? First, note that the usual 'dynamical systems' involving for example the smooth [[actions]] of a [[monoid]], if properly construed, will surely form a [[topos]]

The [[topos]] of [[actions]], [[G-sets]]

Let $R$ be a [[line object]] or similar, hence an [[monoid]] or [[abelian group]] under addition (e.g. the [[continuum]] [[real line]]), then an [[action]] of $R$ on  soem $X \in \mathbf{H}$ is an $R$-parameterized 
[[flow]]


an object and $Aut(X) \hookrightarrow End(X)$ its [[automorphism]]

From p. 9:

> Likewise, the infinitesimal version of such systems i.e. vector fields or first-order ODE's, will also form a topos as I pointed out in my Chicago lecture. But what about actual dynamical systems in the spirit of [[Galileo]], for example, second-order ODE's? (Of course, the symplectic or Hamiltonian systems that are also much studied do address this question of states of [[becoming|Becoming]] versus locations of [[being|Being]], but in a special way which it may not be possible to construe as a topos;

This is solved by [[Higher toposes of laws of motion]]
