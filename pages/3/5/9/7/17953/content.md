## Idea

What is called the _Myers effect_ ([Myers 99](#Myers99)) in [[string theory]] is the phenomenon that given $N$  [[D0-branes]] in a constant [[background field|background]] [[RR field]] $F_4$ (the [[field strength]] associated with [[D2-brane]] [[D-brane charge|charge]]) with, crucially, nonabelian effects included via a [[nonabelian DBI action]], then these D0-branes expand into a [[fuzzy 2-sphere]] which represents a spherical [[D0-D2 brane bound state]] of a [[D2-brane]] and $N$ [[D0-branes]] ([Myers 99, section 6, see p. 21 (22 of 33)](#Myers99), [Myers 03, section 4](#Myers03)).
