## Posets ##

A relation $x\lt y$ of a [[poset]] is a **covering relation** if there is no $z$ such that $x\lt z$ and $z\lt y$. In this case, you would say that "$y$ covers $x$".

## Directed Graphs ##

An edge $x\to y$ of a [[directed graph]] satisfies the **covering relation** if there is no vertex $z$ with edges $x\to z$ and $z\to y$.
