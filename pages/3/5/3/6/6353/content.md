## Idea

A _T-fold_ ([Hull 04](#Hull04)) is supposed to be a kind of [[space]] that locally has [[charts]] which are [[Riemannian manifolds]] equipped with a [[B-field]] (i.e. a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] or [[bundle gerbe with connection]]) but where the charts are glued together  not just by [[diffeomorphisms]] (as an ordinary [[smooth manifold]] is) but also by [[T-duality]] transformations along some [[torus]] [[fibers]].

The idea is that a T-fold is a [[target space]] for a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] that is only locally a [[Riemannian manifold]] but globally a more general kind of [[geometry]], due due [[duality in string theory]]. In the literature sometimes the term _[[non-geometric backgrounds]]_ is used for such "generalized geometric" backgrounds.

It is expected that T-folds should have a description in terms of spaces that locally are [[fiber products]] of one [[torus]] [[fiber bundle]] with its T-dual, as the correspondence spaces considered in [[topological T-duality]]. In the [[rational homotopy theory|rational]]/[[Lie theory|infinitesimal]] approximation this is derived from analysis of [[geometry of physics -- fundamental super p-branes|super p-brane WZ-terms ]] in [FSS 16](#FSS16). A proposal for a (non-supersymmetric) global description of T-folds as total spaces of [[principal 2-bundles]] for the [[T-duality 2-group]] is in [Nikolaus-Waldorf 18](#NikolausWaldorf18).

One may then consider [[local field theory]] on these double torus fibrations, and this should be closely related to what is called _[[double field theory]]_ ([Hull 06](#Hull06)).

### Via higher geometry
 {#ReferencesViaHigherGeometry}

A global definition of [[T-folds]] (with [[T-duality]] understood as [[topological T-duality]]) in [[higher differential geometry]], concretely as [[principal 2-bundles]] for the [[T-duality 2-group]] (as described in _[[T-Duality and Differential K-Theory]]_) is proposed in 

* {#Nikolaus14} [[Thomas Nikolaus]], _T-Duality in K-theory and elliptic cohomology_, talk at _String Geometry Network Meeting_, Feb 2014, ESI Vienna ([website](http://www.ingvet.kau.se/juerfuch/conf/esi14/esi14_34.html))

* {#NikolausWaldorf18} [[Thomas Nikolaus]], [[Konrad Waldorf]], _Higher geometry for non-geometric T-duals_, Commun. Math. Phys. **374**  (2020) 317-366 &lbrack;[arXiv:1804.00677](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00677), [doi:10.1007/s00220-019-03496-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-019-03496-3)&rbrack;

The local [[superspace]] [[supergeometry]] of T-folds compatible with this proposal is derived from [[Green-Schwarz action functionals|fundamental super $p$-brane structure]] in:

* {#FSS16} [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:T-Duality from super Lie n-algebra cocycles for super p-branes]]_, [ATMP Volume 22 (2018) Number 5](http://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/atmp/content/vols/0022/0005/) ([arXiv:1611.06536](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06536), [doi:10.4310/ATMP.2018.v22.n5.a3](https://dx.doi.org/10.4310/ATMP.2018.v22.n5.a3))


The [[automorphism 2-group]] of the [[T-duality 2-group]] (and hence potentially the full structure of T-folds) is determined in:

* [[Konrad Waldorf]], *Categorical symmetries of T-duality* &lbrack;[arXiv:2202.09187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09187), [spire:2035224](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2035224)&rbrack;
