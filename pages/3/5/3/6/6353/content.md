## Idea

A _T-fold_ ([Hull 04](#Hull04)) is supposed to be a kind of [[space]] that locally has [[charts]] which are [[Riemannian manifolds]] equipped with a [[B-field]] (i.e. a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] or [[bundle gerbe with connection]]) but where the charts are glued together  not just by [[diffeomorphisms]] (as an ordinary [[smooth manifold]] is) but also by [[T-duality]] transformations along some [[torus]] [[fibers]].

The idea is that a T-fold is a [[target space]] for a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] that is only locally a [[Riemannian manifold]] but globally a more general kind of [[geometry]], due due [[duality in string theory]]. In the literature sometimes the term _[[non-geometric backgrounds]]_ is used for such "generalized geometric" backgrounds.

It is expected that T-folds should have a description in terms of spaces that locally are [[fiber products]] of one [[torus]] [[fiber bundle]] with its T-dual, as the correspondence spaces considered in [[topological T-duality]]. In the [[rational homotopy theory|rational]]/[[Lie theory|infinitesimal]] approximation this is derived from analysis of [[geometry of physics -- fundamental super p-branes|super p-brane WZ-terms ]] in [FSS 16](#FSS16). A proposal for a (non-supersymmetric) global description of T-folds as total spaces of [[principal 2-bundles]] for the [[T-duality 2-group]] is in [Nikolaus-Waldorf 18](#NikolausWaldorf18).

One may then consider [[local field theory]] on these double torus fibrations, and this should be closely related to what is called _[[double field theory]]_ ([Hull 06](#Hull06)).
