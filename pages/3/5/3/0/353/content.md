#Idea#

An $n$-category is an [[infinity-category]] which is _trivial_ in degree greater than $n$. 

More precisely, an $n$-category is an $(n,n)$-category in the sense of [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]].

In a more restrictive sense 
an _$n$_-category is an [[infinity-category]] which has only trivial cells ([[identity]] cells) in degrees greater than $n$.

#Examples#

* A 0-category is a [[set]].

* A 1-category is an ordinary [[category]].

* A 2-category is either a [[strict 2-category]] or a [[bicategory]].

One also speaks of [[(-1)-category|(-1)-categories]].
