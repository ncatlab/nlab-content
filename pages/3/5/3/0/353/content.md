$n$-categories are the main subject of [[higher category theory]], and give their names to [[About|the <i>n</i>Lab]].

#Idea#

An $n$-category is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category]] such that all $(n+1)$-morphisms are [[equivalence]]s, and all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j > n$. (One says that the $\infty$-category is _trivial_ in degree greater than $n$.) This is the same thing as an $(n,n)$-category in the sense of $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]].

Up to equivalence, you may assume that all equivalent pairs of $j$-morphisms for $j > n$ are in fact equal, and many authorities include this as a requirement. On the other hand, you can also write down a definition of $n$-category from scratch (without passing through $\infty$-categories), and then this question never comes up. The point is that you don\'t talk about $j$-morphisms for $j > n$; you stop at $n$-morphisms.

#Examples#

* A $0$-category is a [[set]].

* A $1$-category is an ordinary [[category]].

* A $2$-[[2-category|category]] is (depending on how strict was your initial notion of $\infty$-category) either a [[strict 2-category]] or a [[bicategory]].

One also speaks of $(-1)$-[[(-1)-category|categories]] and $(-2)$-[[(-2)-category|categories]], but these concepts are not as well behaved.
