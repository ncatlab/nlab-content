## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[type theory]] a _definition_ is the construction of a [[type]] or a [[term]] of a certain [[type]]. By "construction", we mean that the [[type]] has a [[formation rule]] and the [[term]] has an [[introduction rule]]. Then, there are in general two ways to complete the construction: 

* by adding to the [[type theory]] the [[elimination rules]], [[computation rules]], and [[uniqueness rules]] for [[types]] and their associated [[terms]] which characterize the [[universal property]] of the type (see *[[natural deduction]]*),

* by adding to the type theory a rule stating that the type or term [[equality|is equal to]] an existing term or type.

Many types in type theory, such as [[function types]], [[product types]], [[coproduct types]], [[booleans type]], [[natural numbers type]], [[integers]], et cetera, are defined in both ways, by [[universal properties]] and by [[equality]] with another type. 

## Rules for definitions and single assignment operators

One way that definitions of types and of terms could be formalized inside the type theory is by the use of [[equality]] with another term or type. More specifically, every definition of a symbol $A$ comes with a **formation rule** for the symbol which states that it is a type or an **introduction rule** for the symbol which states that it is a term of a type, and a **definition rule** that the term or type $A$ is equal to some existing term or type $B$. The equality used in the definition rule is called **[[definitional equality]]**. 

As documented in the article on [[equality]], there are three notions of equality used in type theory: judgmental equality, propositional equality, and typal equality. All three notions of equality could be used in the definition rule. In [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] and [[cubical type theory]], symbols and abbreviations are defined using judgmental equality. In [[ZFC]] and [[ETCS]], they are defined using propositional equality, and in [[objective type theories]], they are defined using typal equality. 

For example, suppose that the type $B$ is already derived in some context $\Gamma$. Then, in order to define the symbol $A$ to be the type $B$ there are the following formation and definition rules for $A$:

* Formation and judgmental definition rules for $A$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{type}}$$

* Formation and propositional definition rules for $A$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash A = B\; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Formation and typal definition rules for $A$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \: \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash \delta_A:A \simeq B}$$

Similarly, suppose that the term $b:A$ is already derived in some context $\Gamma$. Then, in order to define the symbol $a$ to be the term $b:A$ there are the following introduction and definition rules for $a$:

* Introduction and judgmental definition rules for $a$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash a:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash a = b:A}$$

* Introduction and propositional definition rules for $a$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash a:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Introduction and typal definition rules for $a$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash a:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \delta_a:a =_A b}$$

However, including separate rules for each new term or type is very cumbersome and would lead to an explosion of rules in the type theory. To handle that, one usually introduces the **single assignment operator**, **initialization operator**, **initialisation operator**, or **definition operator** $\coloneqq$ to the type theory, which is formally defined as a pair of judgments 

* $B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}$, where we judge $B$ to be defined as the type $A$, or assigned the type $A$ 
* $b \coloneqq a:A$, where we judge $b$ to be defined as the term $a:A$, or assigned the term $a:A$ 

in addition to the [[judgments]] for [[types]], [[terms]], and [[judgmental equality]]. $B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}$ is called **type definition**, **type initialization**, **type initialisation** or **type single assignment**, while $b \coloneqq a:A$ is called **term definition**, **term initialization**, **term initialisation**, or **term single assignment**. Judgmental single assignment is different from judgmental equality as judgmental equality is an [[equivalence relation]], while judgmental single assignment is not an equivalence relation, but instead has a reflection rule into [[equality]]. 

Depending upon what notion of [[equality]] is used for [[definitional equality]], the single assignment operator has the following formation and equality reflection rules for type definitions

* Formation and judgmental equality reflection rules for type definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \equiv A\; \mathrm{type}}$$

* Formation and propositional equality reflection rules for type definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \equiv A\; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Formation and typal equality reflection rules for type definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash P:B \simeq A}$$

There are also the following introduction and equality reflection rules for term definitions:

* Introduction and judgmental equality reflection rules for term definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash b:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash b \equiv a:A}$$

* Introduction and propositional equality reflection rules for term definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash b:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash b \equiv_A a \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Introduction and typal equality reflection rules for term definition:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash b:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \coloneqq a:A}{\Gamma \vdash p:b =_A a}$$

## Copy definitions

Another way of typally defining a type $A$ to be a type $B$ is via **copying**. Copying becomes important for typally defining the [[type of equivalences]], as the usual way of typally defining types involves the [[type of equivalences]] and thus isn't available. There are two ways to copy a type $A$ to a type $B$, by using **unary sums** or **unary products**. 

### Unary sums

The rules for copying the type $A$ over to the symbol $B$ are given as follows:

Formation rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}$$

Introduction rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{copy}(a):B}$$

Elimination rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma, z:B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash c:C[\mathrm{copy}(x)/z] \quad \Gamma \vdash e:B}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{ind}_{B}^C(c, e):C[e/z]}$$

Computation rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma, z:B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash c:C[\mathrm{copy}(x)/z] \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \beta_B:\mathrm{ind}_{B}^C(c, \mathrm{copy}(a)) =_{C[\mathrm{copy}(a)/z]} c[a/x]}$$

Uniqueness rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma, z:B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash c:C[\mathrm{copy}(x)/z] \quad \Gamma \vdash e:B \quad \Gamma, y:B \vdash u:C \quad \Gamma, a:A \vdash i_\mathrm{copy}(u):u[\mathrm{copy}(a)/y] =_{C[\mathrm{copy}(a)/y]} c[a/x]}{\Gamma \vdash \eta_{B}:u[e/z] =_{C[e/z]} \mathrm{ind}_{B}^C(c, e)}$$

\begin{theorem}
$\mathrm{copy}$ is an [[equivalence of types]] between $A$ and $B$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose one takes the type family $C$ in the elimination, computation, and uniqueness rules to be the type family $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B (-)$. Then the elimination rule states that $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B b$ has an element for all elements $b:B$, the computation rule states that given all elements $a:A$ the type $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B \mathrm{copy}(a)$ is contractible, and the uniqueness rule states that if the type $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B \mathrm{copy}(a)$ is contractible for all elements $a:A$, then the type $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B b$ is contractible for all elements $b:B$. Thus, $\mathrm{copy}$ is an [[equivalence of types]], since the type $\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{copy}(x) =_B b$ is contractible for all elements $b:B$. 
\end{proof}

### Unary products

The rules for copying the type $A$ over to the symbol $B$ are given as follows:

Formation rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}$$

Introduction rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{copy}(a):B}$$

Elimination rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash b:B}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{original}(b):A}$$

Computation rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{original}(\mathrm{copy}(a)) \equiv a:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{original}(\mathrm{copy}(a)) \equiv_A a \; \mathrm{true}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \beta_{B}(a):\mathrm{original}(\mathrm{copy}(a)) =_A a}$$

Uniqueness rules for the symbol $B$:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash b:B}{\Gamma \vdash b \equiv \mathrm{copy}(\mathrm{original}(b)):B} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash b:B}{\Gamma \vdash b \equiv_{B} \mathrm{copy}(\mathrm{original}(b)) \; \mathrm{true}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash b:B}{\Gamma \vdash \eta_{B}(b):b =_{B} \mathrm{copy}(\mathrm{original}(b))}$$

Unary products results in defining $\mathrm{copy}$ to be a [[quasi-inverse function]]. Unary products with typal [[conversion rules]] are the same as unary sums in the presence of [[UIP]]/[[axiom K]] and [[function extensionality]], but they are in general not the same. Unary products with judgmental or propositional [[conversion rules]] turn $\mathrm{copy}$ into a [[judgmentally strict equivalence]] and a [[propositionally strict equivalence]] respectively. 

### Copying as assignment

There is an alternative to the typal structural rules for type definitions, which use the [[natural deduction]] rules for copying types instead of a reflection rule into an [[equivalence of types]]. We use unary sums because they result in the right notion of equivalence in all conditions, even in type theories without judgmental or propositional equality or [[UIP]]/[[axiom K]] or [[function extensionality]]. 

* Formation and introduction rules for type definitions
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{copy}(a):B}$$

* Elimination rules for type definitions
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B \coloneqq A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, z:B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash c:C[\mathrm{copy}(x)/z] \quad \Gamma \vdash e:B}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{ind}_{B}^C(c, e):C[e/z]}$$
