## In type theory

In [[type theory]] a _definition_ is the construction of a [[term]] of a certain [[type]]. 

As such definitions are no different from [[proofs]] of [[theorems]] (due [[propositions-as-types]]). For instance the [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] proof that there _exists_ a [[natural number]] consists of exhibiting one, and hence the definition of, say $2 \in \mathbb{N}$ is the same as a specific proof that $\exists x \in \mathbb{N}$.
