##Idea

A **pointed type** is a [[type]] equipped with a [[term]] of that type.

The [[categorical semantics]] is a [[pointed object]].

## Properties

There is a way of pointing any type $X$ by forming the sum $X+\mathbf{1}$ and taking $inr(\star_{\mathbf{1}})$ as the base point. 

### Propositions as types

In the [[propositions as types]] interpretation of [[type theory]], every pointed type represents a [[true]] [[proposition]]. Contrast this to an inhabited type, which only represents the [[double negation]] of a true proposition. 

## Type of pointed types

For a given type universe $\mathcal{U}$ the type of pointed types is

$$\mathcal{U}_+\equiv \sum_{X:\mathcal{U}}X$$
