#Definition#

A **semipresheaf** on a [[semicategory]] $C$ is a [[semifunctor]]

$$
 F : C^{op} \to Set
$$

from the opposite semicategory $C^{op}$ of $C$ to the category [[Set]] of [[set]]s.

The **category of semipresheaves** on $C$, usually denoted $[C^{op},Set]_{semi}$, or just $[C^{op},Set]$ when the context is clear has:

* semifunctors $F : C^{op} \to Set$ as objects;

* [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between such semifunctors as morphisms.
