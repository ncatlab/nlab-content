Geometric measure theory studies various [[measure]]s of subsets of [[Euclidean spaces]] (and possibly of some geometric generalizations) and their geometric properties. Especially, one studies [[rectifiability]] of subsets of some lower dimensionality, to define notions like area, arc length etc. and to study distributions and currents on such spaces. Very central questions and motivations belong to the [[variational calculus|variational problems]] including the study of minimal surfaces.
