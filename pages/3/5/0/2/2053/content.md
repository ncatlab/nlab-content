## Idea

Given a [[pair]] of [[groups]] $G_1, G_2 \,\in\,$ [[Grp]],
or more generally an [[n-tuple|$n$-tuple]] $\big(G_1, G_2, \cdots, G_n\big)$ of groups, what is traditionally called their __free product__ and denoted

$$
  G_1 \star G_2
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp
$$

or generally

$$
  \star_i G_i
  \;\coloneqq\;
  G_1 \star G_2 \star \cdots \star G_n
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp
$$ 

is really their *[[coproduct]]* in [[Grp]]:

$$
  \star_i G_i \;\simeq\; \amalg_i G_i
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp 
  \,.
$$

More generally, if each of the given groups is equipped with a [[homomorphism]] 

$$
  \iota_i \,\colon\, H \longrightarrow G_i
$$

from a fixed group $H \,\in\, Grpd$

> (often taken to be [[monomorphisms]], hence [[injections]], hence [[subgroup]]-inclusions $A \hookrightarrow G_i$ and reducing to the previous situation when $H = 1$ is the [[trivial group]]) 

then what is traditionally called their **amalgamated free product** (or similar), and denoted

$$
  G_1 \star_A G_2
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp
$$

or generally

$$
  \underset{A}{\star_i} G_i
  \;\coloneqq\;
  G_1 \star_A G_2 \star_A \cdots \star_A G_n
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp
$$ 

is the corresponding [[pushout]] 

$$
  G_1 \star_A G_2
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  G_1 \overset{H}{\amalg} G_2
  \;\;
  \in
  \;
  Grp
$$


(or generally the [[colimit]]) in the [[category]] [[Grpd]], hence the unique group, up to [[isomorphism]], which

1. receives [[homomorphisms]] $q_i$ from the $G_i$ such that their [[precompositions]] with the respective $\iota_i$ all agree,

2. is [[universal property|universal with this property]] in that for any other group $Q$ receiving such homomorphisms $f_i$ these factor through the respective $q_i$ via a single and unique comparison homomorphism, shown as a dashed arrow in the following diagram:

\begin{tikzcd}[sep=25pt]
  & 
  G_1
  \ar[dr, "{ q_1 }"{description}]
  \ar[drr, bend left=20, "{ f_1 }"{description}]
  \\
  H 
  \ar[ur, "{ \iota_1 }"{description}]
  \ar[dr, "{ \iota_2 }"{description}]
  \ar[rr, phantom, "{ \scalebox{.6}{(po)} }"]
    && 
  G_1 \star_{{}_H} G_2
  \ar[r, dashed]
  &
  Q
  \\
  & 
  G_2
  \ar[ur, "{ q_2 }"{description}]
  \ar[urr, bend right=20, "{ f_2 }"{description}]
\end{tikzcd}


## Examples

\begin{example}
  For $S \in $ [[Sets]], the [[free group]] on $S$ is equivalently the [[free product]] of $S$ copies of the [[additive group of integers]]:
$$
  F(S) \;\simeq\; \star_S \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$
An abstract way to understand this elementary fact is to notice that $F$ is the [[free construction]] [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] which sends a [[group]] $G$ to its [[underlying]] [[set]] $U(G)$:
$$
  F \,\colon\,Set \rightleftarrows Grp \,\colon\, U
  \,.
$$
But since 

1. [[left adjoints preserve colimits]] and hence in particular [[preserved colimit|preserve]] [[coproducts]], 

1. every set is the [[coproduct]] of copies of the [[singleton set]] $\ast \,\in\,$ [[Set]] indexed by its [[elements]] $s \in S$, 

1. the [[free group]] on the [[singleton set]] is the additive group of [[integers]]

we have
$$
  \begin{array}{l}
    F(S)
    \\
    \;\simeq\;
    F\Big(\underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} \ast\Big)
    \\
    \;\simeq\;
    \underset{s \in S}{\coprod} F(\ast)
    \\
    \;\simeq\;
    \underset{s \in S}{\coprod} \mathbb{Z}    
    \\
    \;\simeq\;
    \underset{s \in S}{\star} \mathbb{Z}
    \,.
  \end{array}
$$
\end{example}


## Properties

### Presentation
 {#Presentation}

If all the $G_i$ have [[group presentations]], then their free product $\star_i G_i$ has a [[group presentation]] as follows: 

Assume $G_i = \langle S_i|R_i\rangle = F_i/N_i$, where 

1. each $F_i=\langle S_i\rangle$ is the [[free group]] on a [[set]] $S_i$ 

1. $N_i\subset F_i$ is the [[normal subgroup]] of $F_i$ generated by the subset $R_i\subset F_i$, 

then the free product

$$
  \star_i G_i 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \left\langle 
    \coprod_i S_i | \coprod_i R_i 
  \right\rangle 
  \;=\; 
  (\star_i F_i)/\langle\cup_i N_i\rangle
$$
is [[group presentation|presented]] by the [[disjoint unions]] of the $S_i$ and the $R_i$.  

(As with anything satisfying a [[universal property]], the result does not depend on the presentations, up to unique [[isomorphism]].)

### Existence

Free products of groups always exist. 

With the [above](#Presentation) discussion of presentations this follows from the fact that any group $G_i$ has a presentation: we can always take $S_i$ to be the [[underlying set]] of $G_i$ and take $R_i$ to be the set of all [[words]] in $F_i$ that become [[equality|equal]] to the [[neutral element]] in $G_i$.  

The value of the more general construction above is that one often has much smaller $S_i$ and $R_i$ to work with.  Even if $G_i$ is infinite, the $S_i$ and $R_i$ might be [[finite set|finite]] (in the strictest sense), making this part of [[finite mathematics]] and directly subject to the methods of [[combinatorial group theory]].

## References

The notion of amalgamated free products of groups seems to be due to

* [[Otto Schreier]], §1 in: *Die Untergruppen der freien Gruppen*, Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hambg. **5** (1927) 161–183 &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/BF02952517](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02952517)&rbrack;

where it is discussed (though not under any name) complete with the [[universal property]] of what today we recognize as a [[colimit]] (long before this [[category theory]]-notion was formulated in generality).
