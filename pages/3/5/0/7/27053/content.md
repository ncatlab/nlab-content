There are several Macdonald conjectures, including [[Macdonald conjecture on plane partitions]], Macdonald positivity conjecture (see wikipedia: [Macdonald polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_polynomials))

Useful disambiguation is at wikipedia: [Macdonald conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_conjecture) (disambiguation)

## Idea

[[Freeman Dyson]] introduced a conjecture about a constant term of certain Laurent polynomial in $n$ variables.

Macdonald conjecture is ist generalization to any [[root system]], including affine root systems.

It has been proved by Cherednik in 1995; for that purpose he (earlier) introduced [[double affine Hecke algebra]]s.
