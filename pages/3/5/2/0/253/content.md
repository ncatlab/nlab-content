#Idea#

A **bicategory** is a particular [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] notion of _weak [[2-category]]_.  The idea is that a bicategory is a category _weakly_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Cat]]: the [[hom-object|hom-objects]] of a bicategory are categories, but the associativity and unity laws of [[enriched category|enriched categories]] hold only up to coherent isomorphism.
