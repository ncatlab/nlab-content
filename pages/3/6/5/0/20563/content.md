## Idea

A _sphere packing_ in a [[Euclidean space]] of [[dimension]] $n+1$ is an [[embedding of differentiable manifolds|embedding]] of congruent [[n-spheres]] of some fixed [[radius]], that do not intersect but may touch.

## Sphere packing problem

The _sphere packing problem_ is the problem of finding the densest possible sphere packings in any dimension.

### Low dimensional cases

For $n+1 = 1$ the problem is trivial. 

For $n+1 = 2$ it is relatively easy to show that the densest packing is given by spheres centered on the [[vertices]] of the [[honeycomb lattice]].

For $n+1 = 3$ it used to [[Kepler's conjecture]] that the densest packing is that given by spheres centered on the cubical lattice. This was proven only with ample computer assistance by the [[Flyspeck project]].


### Exceptional cases 

For $n+1 = 8$ the denest packing is that of spheres centered on the [[E8-lattice]] ([Viazovska 16](#Viazovska16)).

For $n+1 = 24$ the densists packing is that of spheres centered on the [[Leech lattice]] ([CKMRV 17](#CKMRV17)).

An interpretation of the ingredients entering these proofs in terms of bounds on scaling dimensions of fields in [[conformal field theories]], and interpretation of the result, via [[AdS/CFT]] as related to the [[weak gravity conjecture]] in AdS-[[quantum gravity]], is due to ([HMR 19](#HMR19)).



### Irregular cases

For other values of $n$ exact solutions remain unknown, but numerlical simulation shows that the densest sphere packings in the remaining dimensions will not be controlled by [[lattice in a vector space|lattices]], but be highly irregular.
