A **pseudofunctor** is a specific algebraic notion of _weak functor_ between [[bicategory|bicategories]] (or [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]), i.e. a functor which preserves composition and identities only up to coherent specified isomorphism.

When the domain and codomain are known to be bicategories, there is not much reason to say "pseudofunctor" instead of "functor," since in most situations the only relevant type of functor between bicategories is weak.  However, if the domain and codomain are [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]] (including the case of ordinary 1-categories equipped with only identity 2-cells), it can be helpful to say "pseudofunctor" or "weak functor" to emphasize that the functor is not strict.

Pseudo or weak functors are also to be distinguished from [[lax functor|lax]] and oplax functors, which preserve identities and composition only up to a non-invertible transformation in one direction or the other.

An older terminology, which the author of this page believes should be avoided at all costs, uses "homomorphism of bicategories" for a weak functor and "morphism of bicategories" for a lax one.
