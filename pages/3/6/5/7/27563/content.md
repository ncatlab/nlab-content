## Idea

In the context of [[higher category theory]], the concept of a **double ∞-category** plays the same role as that of a [[double category]] in ordinary category theory.

A double ∞-category is a 2-dimensional construct that has (a space of) objects and two types of (spaces of) arrows (1-cells) between objects: vertical arrows and horizontal arrows. A double ∞-category also contains (a space of) 2-cells.
