## Topics

### General

Lawvere introduced [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] as a category-theoretic way to describe finitary [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]].  He generalised [[Grothendieck toposes]] to [[elementary toposes]], revolutionising the [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]]; in this vein, he developed the foundation [[ETCS]].  He also introduced and worked on [[synthetic differential geometry]].  Building on the he introduced the notion of [[cohesive topos]]. 


### Motivation from foundations of physics
 {#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysica}

Lawvere's fundamental motivation for most of his work is apparently interest in the [[foundations]] of [[physics]], specifically of ([[classical physics|classical]]) [[continuum mechanics]].

From the [Wikipdia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawvere):

> Lawvere studied [[continuum mechanics]] as an undergraduate with [[Clifford Truesdell]]. He learned of [[category theory]] $[...]$ found it a promising framework for simple rigorous [[axioms]] for the physical ideas of Truesdell and [[Walter Noll]]. 

The title of the early text _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_, which is often cited as the text introducing [[synthetic differential geometry]], clearly witnesses the origin and motivation of these ideas in [[classical mechanics]].

A review of this with more comments on more relations to physics is in the introduction to the book collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_, which is the proceedings of a meeting organized by Lawvere in 1982

The [Wikipdia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawvere) concludes

> Lawvere continues to work on his 50-year quest for a rigorous flexible base for physical ideas, free of unnecessary analytic complications.
