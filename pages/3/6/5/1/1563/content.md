F. William Lawvere 

* ([web site](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/))

is one of the greatest [[category theory|category theorists]] of all time.  

He invented  [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] as a category-theoretic way to describe finitary [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]].  He generalised [[Grothendieck topos]]es to elementary [[topos]]es, revolutionising the [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]]; in this vein, he developed the foundation [[ETCS]].  He also introduced and worked on [[synthetic differential geometry]].  Building on the he recently introduced the notion of [[cohesive topos]]. 

His motivation for all of this, believe it or not, is to better understand classical [[physics]]. See [[higher category theory and physics]] for more on this.
