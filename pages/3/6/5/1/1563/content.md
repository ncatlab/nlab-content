F. William Lawvere is one of the greatest category theorists of all time.  He invented [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] as a category-theoretic way to describe finitary [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]].  He generalised [[Grothendieck topos]]es to elementary [[topos]]es, revolutionising the [[foundations]] of mathematics; in this vein, he developed the foundation [[ETCS]].  He also works on [[synthetic differential geometry]].  His motivation for all of this, believe it or not, is to better understand classical [[physics]].
