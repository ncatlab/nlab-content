**Universality** is a "term of the art" which means the following:

+-- {: .standout}
Under the proper conditions, different systems can exhibit the same behaviour, as measured by quantitative indices, if they meet the same qualitative criteria.  Sets of systems which are equivalent in this manner are known as **universality classes**.

If we have some complicated phenomenon we can't understand directly, and we figure out (or make a good stab at guessing) the universality class to which it belongs, we can make testable predictions about the complicated thing by working with a simpler member of that universality class.  Membership in a universality class depends on properties like how many spatial dimensions a system lives in, symmetries and the like.  People have identified universality classes, with varying degrees of rigour.  Lots of them have names, sometimes even with dashes inside; the ones we understand less well and aren't so familiar with get abstruse symbols for labels instead.  A non-exhaustive tabulation of these labels might look something like this:

Stable Distributions | Equilibrium | Random Matrices | Non-Equilibrium | Extreme-Value Distributions | Dynamical Maps |
--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
Gaussian      | 2D Ising          | Unitary         | Directed percolation | Gumbel  | 1D Feigenbaum |
Cauchy        | 2D Potts          | Orthogonal      | Dynamic percolation  | Fr&#233;chet | 2D Volume-preserving |
L&#233;vy          | 2D Tricritical Ising    | Symplectic | CDP  | Weibull | $\vdots$ |
&#160;              | 2D Tricritical Potts | $U(N+M)/U(N)\times U(M)$ | TDP | | |
&#160;              | 2D Other RSOS | $ Sp(N+M)/Sp(N)\times Sp(M)$ | Manna | | |
&#160;              | 3D Ising | $ Sp(2N) $ | Edwards--Wilkinson | | |
&#160;              | 3D Potts | $ SO(2N) $ | KPZ | | |
&#160;              | $\vdots$ | $ O(N+M) / O(N) \times O(M) $ | $\vdots$ | | |
&#160;              | &#160; | $ SO(2N) / U(N) $ | &#160; | | |
&#160;              | &#160; | $ Sp(2N) / U(N) $ | &#160; | | |

The general concept of [[renormalization]] is really important here.  The universality classes we understand best correspond to fixed points of renormalization-group transforms.

The first column, "stable distributions", basically comes from the central limit theorem and the ways in which the conditions necessary for it to apply can fail to obtain.  The middle column with all the funny symbols comes from [[Ã‰lie Cartan]]'s classification of [[symmetric space|symmetric spaces]].  The 2D part of the equilibrium statistical systems can be given a taxonomy based on the [[ADE classification]] of [[Dynkin diagram|Dynkin diagrams]] and [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]].

Relationships from one column to another do exist. For example, dynamical surface growth and [[random matrix theory]] are, unexpectedly, linked: the [[eigenvalue]] distributions of the Gaussian Unitary and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles show up as surface heights in Kardar-Parisi-Zhang phenomena.
