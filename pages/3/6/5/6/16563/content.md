## Idea

A nominal set is a formalization of the idea of a set whose elements can have "variables" or "atoms" in them. Nominal sets are used in [[computer science]] to formalize notions of bound variables and [[alpha-equivalence]].

## Definition

A nominal set is an object of the [[Schanuel topos]].
One concrete description of this topos is that it is the [[category of G-sets]] for the group of permutations of the natural numbers topologized as a subspace of the [[Baire space of sequences]]. The continuity can be described as the finite support property below.

A nominal set is a set $X$ with an action of the group of permutations of natural numbers such that each element has finite support: for each $x \in X$ there is some finite subset $supp(x) \subseteq N$ such that if $\pi$ fixes $supp(x)$ then $\pi \cdot x = x$.
