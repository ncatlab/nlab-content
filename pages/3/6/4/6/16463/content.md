## Idea

In _[[quantum physics|quantum]] [[physics]]_, specifically in fundamental physics/[[high energy physics]], the term "theory of everything" is used to refer to a (hypothetical) [[theory (physics)|theory]] which coherently subsumes "all" of fundamental physics, in some sense.

Taken at face value this terminology has its evident problems, but its usage is to be understood in the context of the situation of the field of theoretical physics at the turn to the 21st century, where it has the evident and justified restricted meaning of a theory which, somehow, coherently subsumes and possibly explains from more fundamental principles both: 

* the [[nLab:standard model of particle physics]], based on [[nLab:Yang-Mills theory]];

* the [[nLab:standard model of cosmology]], based on [[nLab:Einstein gravity]]. 

One issue here is to unify these at the level of [[quantum field theory]] proper (which seems to be accomplished by [[string theory]] at least in broad outline, for more see at *[[quantum gravity]]*), the next issue is to go beyond [[perturbative quantum field theory]] and account for still largely elusive [[non-perturbative effects]] (working title: "[[M-theory]]") such as [[confinement]] via the [[mass gap problem|mass gap]] of [[QCD]]. Yet another issue is to possibly find an explanation for some of the random-looking structures in these standard models, for more on this see also at *[[grand unified field theory]]* and *[[exceptional naturalism]]*; or else to understand these as just random artefacts (in a "[[multiverse]]" of physically allowed structures).

Notice here that in their colloquial meaning the terms _theory of everything_ and _grand unified field theory_ largely overlap, but that as technical terms they are understood quite differently: The term _[[grand unified field theory]]_ is used almost exclusively for [[nLab:gauge group]]-unification, which is not even part of all proposals for a "theory of everything".
