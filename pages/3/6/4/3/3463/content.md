A **Stone space** is a [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[connected space|totally disconnected]] [[topological space]].

Stone spaces are sometimes called [[profinite spaces]], since they are precisely the spaces which are small [[cofiltered limits]] of discrete finite spaces, and moreover (as a consequence of [[Stone duality]]) the category of Stone spaces is equivalent to the category $pro(FinSet)$ of [[pro-objects]] in [[FinSet]] and finite sets sit $FinSet\hookrightarrow pro(FinSet)$ as finite discrete spaces.  This is especially common when talking about [[profinite group]]s and related topics.
