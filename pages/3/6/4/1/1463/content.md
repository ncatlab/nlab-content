[[!redirects ultrafilter principle]]


In classical mathematics, the ultrafilter theorem is a theorem about ultrafilters, proved as a standard application of [[Zorn's lemma]].  In the [[foundations]] of mathematics, however, it is interesting to consider which results are implied by it or equivalent to it (very few imply it without being equivalent, other than those that imply the full axiom of choice itself).


## Statement and proof

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Ultrafilter theorem

Given a [[set]] $X$, every proper [[filter]] on $X$ may be extended to an [[ultrafilter]] (that is, a maximal proper filter) on $X$.

###### Standard proof

Given a proper filter $F$ on $X$, consider the [[partial order|poset]] of proper filters that refine (contain) $F$, ordered by inclusion (reverse refinement).  Of course, $F$ is in this poset.  Given a chain $\mathcal{C}$ of proper filters that refine $F$, the [[union]] $F \cup \bigcup \mathcal{C}$ is a proper filter that refines $F$ and is an upper bound of $\mathcal{C}$.  By [[Zorn's lemma]], there is a proper filter maximal among those that refines $F$, which is therefore maximal among all proper filters.

Although this proof uses Zorn's lemma, the statement itself is weaker.  In particular, it is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]] (even assuming the principle of [[excluded middle]]).

## Other formulations

Here are several statements equivalent (internal to an arbitrary [[topos]]) to the ultrafilter theorem.

The first three are, if you work through the definitions, almost direct rephrasings of the theorem above:
*  Every [[net]] has a universal subnet.  (We must define 'subnet' and 'universal net' properly to make this work, at which point the equivalence is immediate.)
*  The Boolean prime ideal theorem: every proper [[ideal]] in a [[Boolean ring]] is contained in a [[prime ideal]].  (Stronger formulations of the Boolean prime ideal theorem also follow.)
*  The Stone representation theorem: every [[Boolean algebra]] is a subalgebra of some (classical) [[power set]] $2^X$.  (Stronger formulationss of the Stone representation theorem also follow.)

These basic results in [[logic]] are equivalent to the ultrafilter theorem:
*  Consistency: if a set $\Sigma$ of formulas in propositional [[classical logic]] is syntactically consistent (proves no contradiction), then it is semantically consistent (has a model).  (The converse is immediate; stronger formulations of the consistency theorem, including for predicate logic, also follow.)
*  Compactness: if every finite subset of $\Sigma$ has a model, then so does $\Sigma$.  (The converse is immediate; stronger formulations of the compactness theorem, including for predicate logic, also follow.)

Various characterisations of [[compact space]]s are equivalent to the ultrafilter theorem:
*  Given a set $S$, the space $2^S$ (in the product topology) is compact.  (This can be seen as a very weak form of the Tychonoff theorem below.)
*  More generally, if every ultrafilter on a [[convergence space]] $X$ is convergent, then $X$ is compact.
*  A [[uniform space]] is compact if it is complete and totally bounded.  (The converse is immediate.)

These classical results in analysis are equivalent to the ultrafilter theorem in a [[Boolean topos]] with [[natural numbers object]]:
*  The [[Tychonoff theorem]] for [[Hausdorff space]]s: any product of compact Hausdorff spaces is compact; equivalently, any product of compact Hausdorff spatial [[locale]]s is spatial.  (If we drop the Hausdorff condition, then the result is equivalent to the full [[axiom of choice]].)
*  [[Stone-Cech compactification]]: the [[compact Hausdorff space]]s form a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Top]].  (The classical result that they form a reflective subcategory of the category $T_3$ of completely regular Hausdorff spaces is enough; the classical result that the reflection is a dense embedding on $T_3$ also follows.)
*  [[Banach-Alaoglu theorem]]: the closed unit ball of the double dual of a [[Banach space]] is weak* compact.  (The result for *separable* spaces does not require the ultrafilter theorem.)

It\'s possible that I\'ve made some mistakes above in deciding which of these use excluded middle or the existence of a natural numbers object.  (I very much doubt that any of them use replacement.)
