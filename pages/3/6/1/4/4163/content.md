## Idea

Perturbative quantum field theory is [[quantum field theory]] where the [[interaction]] (between [[field (physics)|fields]]/[[particles]]) is treated as a tiny correction to the [[free field theory]], so that the resulting [[quantum observables]] are [[formal power series]] (in [[Planck's constant]] and) in the [[coupling constant]] which measures the strength of the interaction ("[[perturbation theory]]"). 

For all interesting theories this [[formal power series]] has vanishing [[radius of convergence]] ([Dyson 52](perturbation+theory#Dyson52)) and is regarded as an [[asymptotic series]]. Despite this apparent restriction, the perturbative quantum field theory of the [[standard model of particle physics]], where just the first handful of terms in the [[formal power series]] ("loop orders") is used, are in agreement with [[experiment]] to extremely high precision. There are however [[non-perturbative effects]] which are not captured (such as [[instantons in QCD]]).

The rigorous construction of [[quantum field theories]] tends to be hard. The only _complete_ constructions known to date are either [[free field theories]] or [[topological field theories]] or [[interaction|interacting]] field theories on [[spacetimes]] of [[dimension]] $\leq 3$. In particular the [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of [[Yang-Mills theory]] this open problem is one of the "Millenium Problems" (see at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_).

A rigorous formulation of perturvative quantum field theory is given by _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ and its extension to _[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_. See there for more.
