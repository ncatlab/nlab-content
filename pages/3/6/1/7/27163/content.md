## Idea

The correct notion of a [[Kähler differential]] for [[C^∞-rings]]

## Definition

See the article [[Kähler C^∞-differentials of smooth functions are differential 1-forms]] for motivation and definition and the article [[smooth differential forms form the free C^∞-DGA on smooth functions]] for further developments and applications like the [[Poincaré lemma]].
