## Idea 

The notion of *cobordism categories* in the original sense of [Stong 1968](#Stong68)
abstracts basic properties of (variants of) [[categories]] whose [[objects]] are [[compact topological space|compact]] [[manifolds with boundary]], with the [[concept with an attitude|intent]] of regarding these as [[cobordisms]] between their boundary components.

A closely related but nominally different notion are categories whose *[[morphisms]]* are taken to be cobordisms between their boundary components. 

Beware that the use of terminology not always brings out this distinction; but these days the second meaning is more prevalent, in particular in discussion of [[cobordism cohomology]] and of [[topological field theory]].





## Definitions

### Cobordisms as objects

The axiomatization below is motivated as capturing the following familiar situation:

The category $D$ of [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifolds]] with [[boundary]], has finite [[coproducts]] and the boundary operator $\partial \colon D\to D$, $M\mapsto \partial M$ is an [[endofunctor]] commuting with [[coproducts]]. (Often these coproducts are referred to as [[direct sums]]. Notice that $D$ is similar to but not actually an [[additive category]]. The inclusions $i_M \colon \partial M\to M$ form a [[natural transformation]] of functors $i \colon \partial\to Id$. Finally, the [[isomorphism classes]] of objects in $D$ form a set, so $D$ is [[essentially small category|essentially small]] (svelte).


\begin{definition}

A __Stong cobordism category__ is a triple $(D,\partial,i)$ where 

* $D$ is a [[svelte category]] (i.e. an [[essentially small category]])

  * with finite [[coproduct]]s (called [[direct sum]]s, often denoted by $+$), 

  * including an [[initial object]] $0$ (also often denoted by $\emptyset$), 

* $\partial:D\to D$ is an additive (direct-sum-preserving) [[functor]] 

* and $i:\partial\to Id_D$ is a [[natural transformation]] such that $\partial\partial M = 0$ for all [[object]]s $M\in D$.

\end{definition}

[Stong 1968, p. 4](#Stong68).


\begin{remark}
Note that $i$ is *not* required to be a *[[subfunctor]]* of the identity, i.e. the components $i_M$ are not required to be [[monomorphism|monic]], which is however often the case in examples.
\end{remark}


\begin{definition}

Two objects $M$ and $N$ in a cobordism category $(D,\partial,i)$ are said to be __cobordant__, written $M\sim_{cob} N$, if there are objects $U,V\in D$ such that $M+\partial U \cong N+\partial V$ where $\cong$ denotes the relation of being [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] in $D$. 

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
In particular, isomorphic objects are cobordant. Being cobordant is an [[equivalence relation]] and for any object $M$ in $D$, one has $\partial M\sim_{cob} 0$. 

\end{remark}


+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

Objects of the form $\partial M$ where $M$ is an object in $D$ are said to be *boundaries* and the objects $V$ such that $\partial V = 0$ are said to be *closed*. 

=--


+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

In particular, every boundary is closed. A direct sum of closed objects (resp. boundaries) is a closed object (resp. a boundary). If an object $M$ is a boundary and $M\cong N$ then $N$ is also a boundary. 

=--


+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

By the above, the relation of being cobordant is compatible with the direct sum, in the sense that the direct sum induces an associative commutative operation on the set of equivalence classes, which hence becomes a commutative [[monoid]] called the __cobordism semigroup__ 

$$
  \Omega(D,\partial,i)
  \,,
$$ 

of the cobordism category $(D,\partial,i)$.

## Properties

The following properties concern the notion ob cobordism categories with cobordisms serving as morphisms.

### The homotopy type of the cobordism category
 {#GMTWTheorem}

#### Topological case

\begin{theorem}
**(Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem)**
The loop space of the [[classifying space]] ([[geometric realization]] of the [[nerve]]) of the [[cobordism category]] $Cob_k$ is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the [[infinite loop space]] of the spectrum [[MTO(k)]], hence:
$$
\Omega|N Cob_k|
\simeq\Omega^\infty MTO(k)
\coloneqq\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\Omega^{n+k}Th\left({\gamma_\mathbb{R}^{k,n}}^\perp\right).
$$
(Alternatively it is written as $|N 
Cob_k|\simeq\Omega^{\infty-1}MTO(k)$.) ${\gamma_\mathbb{R}^{k,n}}^\perp\twoheadrightarrow Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^{n+k})$ is the orthogonal complement of the real [[tautologial bundle]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
**(Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem)**
The loop space of the [[classifying space]] ([[geometric realization]] of the [[nerve]]) of the [[oriented]] [[cobordism category]] $Cob_k^+$ is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the [[infinite loop space]] of [[MTSO(k)]], hence:
$$
\Omega|N Cob_k^+|
\simeq\Omega^\infty MTSO(k)
\coloneqq\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\Omega^{n+k}Th\left({\widetilde\gamma_\mathbb{R}^{k,n}}^\perp\right).
$$
(Alternatively it is written as $|N Cob_k^+|\simeq\Omega^{\infty-1}MTSO(k)$.) ${\widetilde\gamma_\mathbb{R}^{k,n}}^\perp\twoheadrightarrow\widetilde{Gr}_k(\mathbb{R}^{n+k})$ is the orthogonal complement of the [[oriented]] real [[tautologial bundle]].
\end{theorem}

This is [Galatius, Tillmann, Madsen & Weiss 2009, main theorem](#GMWT09).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This statement may be thought of as a limiting case, of the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem. See there for more.

#### Geometric case

* ([Ayala](#Ayala))

The [[Thom group]] $\mathcal{N}_*$ of cobordism classes of unoriented compact smooth manifolds is the cobordism semigroup for $D=Diff_c$.


## Examples

Examples of cobordism categories besides those of manifolds with [[(B,f)-structure|$(B,f)$-structure]]:

* "foams" used in [[link homology]] following [Khovanov 2004](Khovanov+homology#Khovanov04)
