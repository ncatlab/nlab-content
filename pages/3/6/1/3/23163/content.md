## Definition

An __entire functional calculus algebra__ is a product-preserving functor
$$CartHolo \to Set,$$
where $CartHolo$ is the category of finite-dimensional complex [[vector spaces]]
and holomorphic maps.

This is in complete analogy to [[C^∞-rings]],
and EFC-algebras are applicable in similar contexts.

## Properties

The category of globally finitely presented [[Stein spaces]]
is contravariantly equivalent to the category of finitely presented
EFC-algebras.
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its EFC-algebra of global sections.

The category of [[Stein spaces]] of finite embedding dimension
is contravariantly equivalent to the category of finitely generated EFC-algebras.
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its EFC-algebra of global sections.


These statements can thus be rightfully known as __Stein duality__.
