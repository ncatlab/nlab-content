  Chicago lectures (1967 )

  pp. 1-28 in:

  [[Anders Kock]] (ed.), 

  _Topos Theoretic Methods in Geometry_, 

  Aarhus Univ. Var. Pub. Ser. **30** (1979).

  PDF files of [chapter](https://github.com/mattearnshaw/lawvere/blob/master/pdfs/1978-categorical-dynamics.pdf) and [volume](https://dmitripavlov.org/scans/kock.pdf).

  _Categorical Dynamics Revisited_, talk at _Sets Within Geometry_, Nancy, France 26-29 July 2011 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXATg9_6iWE))

which together with _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_ forms the beginning of the theory of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and its use in the [[foundations]] of [[continuum physics]].
