##Idea

When the [[lattice of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]] is the primordial example of a [[Heyting algebra]] then its dual _lattice of [[closed subsets]]_ is the primordial example of a **co-Heyting algebra**.

In general, co-Heyting algebras are [[duality|dual]] to Heyting algebras and like them come equipped with non-Boolean logical operators that make them interesting players in [[modal logic|modal]], [[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]], and co-intuitionistic logic, [[linguistics]], [[topos theory]], [[continuum physics]], [[quantum theory]] and in [[mereology]].

##Definition

A **co-Heyting algebra** is a bounded [[distributive lattice]] $L$ equipped with a binary _subtraction_ operation $ \backslash :L\times L\to L$ such that $x\backslash y\leq z$ iff $x\leq y\vee z$.[^Dist]

[^Dist]: Existence of $\backslash$ amounts to an [[adjunction]] \_$\backslash y\dashv y\vee$\_ and the existence of a left adjoint implies that $y\vee$\_ preserves limits $\wedge$ hence the assumption of distributivity in the definition is redundant and has been put in for emphasis only.

A **bi-Heyting algebra** is a bounded distributive lattice $L$ that carries a Heyting algebra structure with implication $\Rightarrow$ and a co-Heyting algebra structure with subtraction $\backslash$.

## Remarks

* Co-Heyting algebras were initially called _Brouwerian algebras_ . Bi-Heyting algebras were introduced and studied in a series of papers by Cecylia Rauszer in the 1970s who called them _semi-Boolean algebras_ which suggests to view them as a generalization of [[Boolean algebra|Boolean algebras]].

* A [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ such that the lattice $sub(X)$ of subobjects is a bi-Heyting algebra for every object $X\in\mathcal{E}$ is called a [[bi-Heyting topos]].

## Examples

* The lattice of closed subsets of a topological space is a co-Heyting algebra with $X\backslash Y=\overline{X\cap Y^c}\quad$.

* A Boolean algebra provides a (degenerate) example of a bi-Heyting algebra by setting $x\Rightarrow y:=\neg x\vee y$ and $x\backslash y:=x\wedge\neg y$.

##Properties

* $a\backslash b=0$ iff $a\backslash b\leq O$ iff $a\leq b\vee 0$ iff $a\leq b$. In particular, $a\backslash a=0$.

* As \_$\backslash x$ has a right adjoint it preserves colimits hence: $(a\vee b)\backslash x =(a\backslash x)\vee (b\backslash x)\quad$.

* $a\backslash 0\leq a\backslash 0$ iff $a\leq 0\vee (a\backslash 0)$ iff $a\leq a\backslash 0\quad$. On the other hand, $a\leq 0\vee a$ and the adjunction yield $a\backslash 0\leq a\quad$, hence $a\backslash 0 = a\quad$.

* Suppose $a\leq b\vee x $ then $a\backslash b\leq x$. As from $a\backslash b\leq a\backslash b$ follows $a\leq b\vee (a\backslash b)$, hence $a\backslash b =\Wedge\{x|a\leq b\vee x\}\quad$.

* The subtraction operation permits to define the [[co-Heyting negation]] $\sim: L\to L$, called _non a_ in Lawvere (1991), by setting $\sim a:=1\backslash a$.

* $\sim$ in turn can then be used to define the [[co-Heyting boundary|co-Heyting boundary operator]] $\partial :L\to L$ by $\partial a:=a\wedge\sim a$. That $\partial a$ is not necessary trivial is dual to the non-validity of the _tertium non datur_ for general Heyting algebras and points to the utility of co-Heyting algebras for [[paraconsistent logic]].

* In [[bi-Heyting toposes]] like e.g. [[essential subtoposes]] of presheaf toposes ([Lawvere](#Law91a), [Reyes](#Reyes)), the co-Heyting algebra operations are generally not preserved by [[inverse image functor|inverse image functors]], so that the co-Heyting logical operators are subject to _[[de re and de dicto]]_ effects. The parallel between this and the [[commutator]] in quantum mechanics has been suggested by Lawvere thereby somewhat anticipating the view of D&#246;ring (2013).
