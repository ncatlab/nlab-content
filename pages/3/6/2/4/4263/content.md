## Idea

A spatial locale is a [[locale]] that comes from a [[topological space]].  This is an [[extra property]] of locales, a property of having enough [[point of a locale|points]].


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  Then we may define a [[locale]], denoted $\Omega(X)$, whose [[frame of opens]] is precisely the [[frame]] of [[open subspaces]] of $X$.

A locale is __spatial__ if it is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\Omega(X)$ for some topological space $X$.

A locale $L$ has __enough points__ if, given any two opens $U$ and $V$ in $L$, $U = V$ if (hence iff) precisely the same [[point of a locale|points]] of $L$ belong to $U$ as belong to $V$.


## Properties

The following conditions are all logically equivalent on a [[locale]] $L$:

1.  $L$ is spatial, as defined above.
2.  $L$ has enough points, as defined above.
3.  Given any two opens $U$ and $V$ in $L$, $U \leq V$ if (hence iff) every point of $L$ that belongs to $U$ also belongs to $V$.
4.  $L$ is isomorphic to $\Omega(pt(L))$, where $pt(L)$ is the [[space of points]] of $L$.
5.  The natural morphism $\eta_L\colon \Omega(pt(L)) \to L$ (the [[counit]] of the [[adjunction]] from [[Top]] and [[Loc]]) is an [[isomorphism]].

(It would be nice to state this as a theorem and put in a proof.)

Basically, what is going on here is that we have an [[idempotent adjunction]] from topological spaces to locales, and the spatial locales comprise the image of this adjunction.  The corresponding condition on topological spaces is being [[sober space|sober]].

Therefore, the [[full subcategory]] of $Loc$ on the spatial locales is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the full subcategory of $Top$ on sober spaces.


## Terminology

The term 'spatial locale' can be confusing; it suggests a locale [[internalization|in]] [[Top]] or in some category [[Sp]] of spaces, which is not correct.  Instead, the adjective 'spatial' should be taken in the same vein as 'localic' in '[[localic topos]]' or 'topological' in 'topological [[convergence space|convergence]]'.  These two terms also suggest that these other locales are not [[spaces]], which is incorrect.

The really clear term for a spatial locale is 'locale with enough points to separate the opens', but 'locale with enough points' should be unambiguous.  However, it is still a bit long.  Occasionally one sees 'spacial' instead of 'spatial'.

## Criteria for spatiality

1. Hofmann–Lawson duality (1978; see Picado–Pultr, Theorem VII.6.4.3 and Proposition VII.6.3.3): assuming the [[axiom of choice]], [[locally compact locales]] are spatial.
In particular, [[compact regular locales]] are locally compact, hence automatically spatial.

2. Every [[coherent locale]] is spatial.
In particular, [[Stone locales]], [[Stonean locales]], and [[hyperstonean locales]] are spatial.

3. The meet of a countable family of open sublocales (i.e., a $G_\delta$-sublocale) of a [[compact regular locale]] is spatial.

4. The completion of a [[uniform locale]] with a countable basis of uniformity is spatial.
