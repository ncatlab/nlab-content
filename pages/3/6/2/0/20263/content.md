## Idea

A _homotopy sphere_ is a [[topological space]] which need not be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but which has the same [[homotopy type]] as an $n$-sphere. 

## Properties

\begin{corollary}
Every homotopy sphere is a [[rational homotopy sphere]].
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
Every homotopy sphere is a [[homology sphere]].
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
Every [[simply connected]] [[homology sphere]] is a homotopy sphere.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
A [[connected space|path-connected]], $n$-connected, orientable and closed $2n$-manifold is a homotopy-$2n$-sphere.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
A [[connected space|path-connected]], $n$-connected, orientable and closed $2n+1$-manifold is a homotopy-$2n+1$-sphere.
\end{proposition}

* Every [[smooth manifold]] homotopy-[[4-sphere]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the actual [[4-sphere]].
