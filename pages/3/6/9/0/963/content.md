A **quantale** is a [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal]] [[suplattice]].  This means it is a poset having all [[join]]s and an associative, unital tensor product $\otimes$ which distributes over joins (the internal-homs then come automatically by the [[adjoint functor theorem]]).

Additional conditions often imposed on a quantale include:

* Commutativity: $x\otimes y = y\otimes x$
* Idempotence: $x\otimes x = x$
* The unit for $\otimes$ is the top element: $1=\top$.

If all three of commutativity, idempotence, and $1=\top$ are assumed, they force $\otimes$ to be the [[meet]] and therefore the quantale to be a [[frame]].  General quantales are sometimes considered to be a "noncommutative" version of a frame, whose [[opposite category]] would be a category of "noncommutative [[locale]]s" (hence the name, a [portmanteau](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of "quantum" and "locale").
