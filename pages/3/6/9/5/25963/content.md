## Definition

A **constant polynomial** is a [[polynomial]] where not having [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] $0$ implies that it is the zero polynomial. (In [[classical mathematics]] this is equivalent to saying that a constant polynomial is a polynomial which either has [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] $0$ or is the zero polynomial.) 

Equivalently, given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, [[polynomial rings]] $R[S]$ are [[free object|free]] [[commutative algebra|commutative $R$-algebras]] on an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[finite set]] of [[generators]] $S$; and are characterized by the universal property that it is the [[initial object]] with a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[S]$ and a [[function]] $i:S \to R[S]$. A **constant polynomial** of $R[S]$ is a polynomial which is in the [[image]] of the canonical [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[S]$. 

As a result, the subring of constant polynomials is in [[isomorphism]] with the [[ground ring]].
