Let $\Gamma^{op}$ (see [[Segal's category]]) be the [[skeleton]] of the category of [[finite set|finite]] [[pointed sets]].  We write $\underline{n}$ for the finite pointed set with $n$ non-basepoint elements.  Then a **$\Gamma$-set** is a functor $X\colon \Gamma^{op}\to Set$.

The [[topos]] $\Set^{\Gamma^{op}}$ of $\Gamma$-sets is the [[classifying topos]] for [[pointed objects]] ([MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/85600/what-do-gamma-sets-classify)). For more on this see also at _[[classifying topos for the theory of objects]]_.
