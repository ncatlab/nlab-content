##Idea 
Let $\Gamma^{op}$ (see [[Segal's category]]) be the [[skeleton]] of the category of [[finite set|finite]] [[pointed sets]].  We write $\underline{n}$ for the finite pointed set with $n$ non-basepoint elements.  Then a **$\Gamma$-set** is a functor $X\colon \Gamma^{op}\to Set$.

The [[topos]] $\Set^{\Gamma^{op}}$ of $\Gamma$-sets is the [[classifying topos]] for [[pointed objects]] ([MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/85600/what-do-gamma-sets-classify)). For more on this see also at _[[classifying topos for the theory of objects]]_.

By contrast, in ([Connes & Consani 15, 2.1](#ConnesConsani15)) the authors define a $\Gamma$-set to be a pointed functor $X\colon \Gamma^{op}\to Set_{\ast}$, the category of [[pointed sets]]. The category of $\Gamma$-sets in this sense is no longer a topos, but it is a [[symmetric monoidal closed category]]. This construction is used in their approach to the [[field with one element]].
