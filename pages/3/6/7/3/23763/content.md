## Idea ##

A notion of Cauchy space where only certain Cauchy nets with a particular modulus of convergence converges in the space. 

## Definition ##

Let $S$ be a [[Cauchy space]] (such as a [[uniform space]] or a [[metric space]]). Given a [[directed set]] $I$, $S$ is **$I$-modulated Cauchy complete** if every [[Cauchy net]] in $S$ with index set $I$ and with a $I$-[[modulus of convergence]] [[converges]].

A Cauchy space is said to be **sequentially modulated Cauchy complete** if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $S$ with a $\mathbb{N}$-modulus of convergence converges. 

## Examples ##

* The [[Dedekind real numbers]] are sequentially modulated Cauchy complete. 
* The [[HoTT book real numbers]] are sequentially modulated Cauchy complete.
