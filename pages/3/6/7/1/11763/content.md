## Idea

The principle of _identity of indiscernibles_ states that two objects are [[identical]] if they have all the same [[properties]].

This is also known as "Leibniz's Law", in honor of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (not to be confused with his [[product rule]], also so-called).

{#LeibnizWroteTheFollowing} Concretely, Leibniz wrote the following,  (in translation from [Lewis 1918, p. 373](#Lewis18) with original Latin terms in parenthesis; see also [Cartwright 1971, p. 119](#Cartwright71) and [Gries & Schneider 1998](#GriesSchneider98)):


> Two terms are the *same* (*eadem*) if one can be substituted for the other without altering the truth of any statement (*[[salva veritate]]*). If we have $A$ and $B$, and $A$ enters into some true proposition, and the substitution of $B$ for $A$ wherever it appears results in a new proposition that is likewise true, and if this can be done for every proposition, then $A$ and $B$ are said to be the same; ...

This sentence of Leibniz in fact closes with a statement of the converse, often known as the "[[principle of substitutivity]]" but which may deserve to be called the *indiscernibility of identicals*:

> ... conversely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the same, they can be substituted for one another.

The paragraph ends with the assertion that 

> $A$ and $A$ are, of course, said to be the same

This is what [[Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre|Fichte 1794]] later called the "first, absolutely unconditioned principle" and [[Science of Logic|Hegel 1812-]] [called](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Science+of+Logic#875) the "[[first law of thought]]". 

From the perspective of [[homotopy type theory]], the "[[first law of thought]]" is the [[term introduction]]-rule for [[identity types]], and "indiscernability of identicals" is the [[transport]]-rule, which together with "identiy of indiscernible" is implied by the [[induction]]-rule of the [[identity type]] (the "[[J-rule]]"). For more on this see [below](#InHomotopyTypeTheory).

In [[set theory]] with [[power sets]], the [[inference rule]] for the identity of indiscernables is given by 

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{set}}{\Gamma, x \in A, y \in A \vdash \left(\forall P \in \mathcal{P}(A).P(x) \iff P(y)\right) \implies x =_A y \; \mathrm{true}}$$


## In dependent type theory
 {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

### Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles

In [[dependent type theory]], a direct translation of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles requires a way to quantify over all [[propositions]] and [[predicates]]. The only way this is possible is if the dependent type theory comes with a [[type of all propositions]] and thus [[power sets]], the latter of which are the type of all [[predicates]] on a type. In addition, unlike with [[set theory]], one cannot simply say that there is a dependent function 

$$\mathrm{idOfInd}_A:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} \left(\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)\right) \to (x =_A y)$$

This is because the [[identity type]] has more than one element, and thus indiscernibles could be identified in more than one way. Instead, the identity of indiscenibles for type $A$ is given by the dependent function 

$$\mathrm{idOfInd}_A:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} (x =_A y) \simeq \left(\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)\right)$$

More concretely, for all $x:A$ and $y:A$, the [[principle of substitution]] is always true because by induction on reflexivity, one could define a function 
$$\mathrm{idToInd}_A(x, y):(x =_A y) \to \left(\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)\right)$$
The identity of indiscernibles is simply the statement that $\mathrm{idToInd}_A(x, y)$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. This is the same concept that motivates the definition of [[partial orders]], [[Kolmogorov topological spaces]], and [[skeletal categories]] in terms of equivalences between identity types and a [[binary endorelation]]. 

If we define the local membership relation $x \in_A P$ as $x \in_A P \coloneqq P(x)$, then Leibniz's identity of indiscenibles becomes

$$\mathrm{idOfInd}_A:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} (x =_A y) \simeq \left(\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} (x \in_A P) \simeq (y \in_A P)\right)$$

This is similar to but not identical to the [[axiom of extensionality]]: the axiom of extensionality is given by
$$\mathrm{extax}_A:\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} \prod_{Q:\mathcal{P}(A)} (P =_{\mathcal{P}(A)} Q) \simeq \left(\prod_{x:A} (x \in_A P) \simeq (x \in_A Q)\right)$$

If Leibniz's identity of indiscenibles is true for $A$, then $A$ is a set, because the type 
$$\prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)$$ 
is always a proposition, in the context of [[weak function extensionality]], and thus by the [[equivalence of types]], $x =_A y$ is also a proposition for all $x:A$ and $y:A$, which means that $A$ is a set. Thus, if Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles is true for all types $A$, the [[dependent type theory]] becomes a [[set-level type theory]] with Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles as an [[axiom of set truncation]]. 

On the other hand, one does not necessarily need Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles to be true for all types $A$, because the type family 
$$x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{ind}_A(x, y) \coloneqq \prod_{P:\mathcal{P}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)$$ 
is always an [[equivalence relation]], and thus one could construct the [[quotient set]] 

$$A/\mathrm{ind}_A$$

as the type 

$$A/\mathrm{ind}_A \coloneqq \sum_{Q:\mathcal{P}(A)} \left[\sum_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} Q(x) \simeq \mathrm{ind}_A(x, y)\right]$$

In [[topology|topological]] terms, this means that every type $A$ with its power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is an [[R0-space]] and the quotient $A/\mathrm{ind}_A$ is a [[T1-space]]. 

### Type-theoretic identity of indiscernibles 

For a version of the identity of indiscernibles which applies to not just sets, but other non-set types, one would have to go from quantifying over predicates to quantifying over [[type families]]: For this, one has to use a [[type universe]] $U$, upon which the identity of indiscenibles for type $A$ is given by the dependent function 

$$\mathrm{idOfInd}_U:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} (x =_A y) \simeq \left(\prod_{P:A \to U} P(x) \simeq P(y)\right)$$

The type-theoretic identity of indiscernibles is similar to but not identical to the [[univalence axiom]] for [[Tarski universes]]: univalence for Tarski universe $(U, T)$ quantifies over $U$-small types and fixes the type reflector type family $A:U \vdash T(A)$ for Tarski universes, while the identity of indiscernables for type $A$ quantifies over $U$-small type families and fixes the type $A$. 

Alternatively, if we want the usual identity of indiscernibles to apply to non-set types, then we have to restrict the identity types to precisely the identity types which are [[propositional equalities]] in the sense of having a [[unique]] [[identification]]:

$$\mathrm{idOfInd}:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} \mathrm{isContr}(\mathrm{Id}_A(x, y)) \simeq \prod_{x:A \to \mathrm{Prop}} P(x) \simeq P(y)$$

### Other versions

In addition, extensionality principles like [[function extensionality]], [[propositional extensionality]], and [[univalence]] ("typal extensionality") are naturally regarded as a stronger form of identity of indiscernibles.
In particular, the [[consistency]] of [[univalence]] means that in [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] without univalence, one cannot define any [[predicate]] that provably distinguishes [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] [[types]]; thus equivalent types are "externally indiscernible", and univalence incarnates that principle internally by making them identical.

"There are several ways to think about the axiom of [[univalence]]. One can see it as a sophisticated updating of Leibniz's principle of the identity of indiscernibles." --[[John Baez]] [nCaf&#233;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/categories_for_the_working_phi.html)

On the other hand, the converse substitution/substitutivity principle of "indiscernibility of identicals" is expressd by *[[transport]]* in [[homotopy type theory]].

## In point-set topology
 {#InPointSetTopology}

A [[topology|topological]] or geometrical version of the idea of identity of indiscernibles is [[separation axioms|separation]]: if two points are distinct, then they are separated in some sense. This means in turn that if two points in a space subject to a given separation axiom can not be separated by any admissible separation condition then they are identical.

{#InTopologicalSpacesMoreInDetail} More in detail: 

Given a [[topological space]] one might declare that "topological observations" about the space are questions of the form: "Which points are contained in a given open subset?", and hence that two points are "discernible", namely "topologically distinct", if there exists an [[open subset]] that contains one but not the other. 
With this convention, the condition that "indiscernibles be identical" is equivalently the condition that the topological space
satisfies the $T_0$-[[separation axiom]], hence that it is a [[Kolmogorov space]]. Generally, one could regard the [$T_0$-reflection](Kolmogorov+topological+space#KolmogorovQuotient) as the [[modality]] under which identity becomes indiscernibility, in this sense.

In [[dependent type theory]], given a [[dominance]] $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$, let $\mathcal{O}(A)$ denote the type of $\Sigma$-[[open sets]] of the type $A$, the type of functions $A \to \Sigma$. The $T_1$-[[separation axiom]] for type $A$ is given by the dependent function

$$T_0:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} (x =_A y) \simeq \left(\prod_{P:\mathcal{O}(A)} P(x) \simeq P(y)\right)$$

Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles is simply the $T_1$-separation axiom where the [[type of all propositions]] $\Omega$ is the dominance and where the [[predicates]]/[[subsets]] are the $\Omega$-[[open sets]]. 

In addition, given an type universe $U$, Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles for $U$ is simply the $T_1$-separation axiom where the type of $U$-small propositions $\mathrm{Prop}_U \coloneqq \sum_{A:U} \mathrm{isProp}(A)$ is the dominance, and where the $U$-small [[predicates]]/[[subsets]] are the $\mathrm{Prop}_U$-[[open sets]]
