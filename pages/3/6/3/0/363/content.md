#Idea#

A Gray-category is a certain type of [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strict]] [[3-category]], in which composition is strictly associative and unital, but the [[interchange law]] holds only up to isomorphism.

#Definition#

A **Gray-category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the symmetric monoidal category Gray, which is the category of [[strict 2-category|2-categories]] and 2-functors with the [[Gray tensor product]].



#Coherence Theorem#

Gordon, Power, and Street proved that every [[tricategory]] (that is, weak 3-category) is equivalent to a Gray-category.  Not every tricategory is equivalent to a fully strict 3-category; any doubly-degenerate [[braided monoidal category]] which is not [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] is an example.  So this is "the best one can do" in one sense, although there are other incomparable paths one can take, such as [[Simpson's conjecture|weakening units]] but keeping interchange strict.
The inclusion of Gray-categories into tricategories is non-canonical -- there is a left and right-hand version (from a remark in Example 9.3.9 of Leinster's book cited below). 

#Gray-Groupoid#

A Gray category that is a [[3-groupoid]] is a [[Gray-groupoid]].
