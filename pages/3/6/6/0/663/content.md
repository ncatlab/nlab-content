A mathematically structure is 'essentially algebraic' if its definition involves partially defined operations satisfying equational laws, where any given operation is defined on a subset where various other operations happen to be equal.  The most familiar example may be the notion of [[category]]: a [[small category]] consists of a set $C_0$ of objects, a set $C_1$ of morphisms, source and target maps $s,t : C_1 \to C_0$ and so on, but composition is only defined for pairs of morphisms where the source of one happens to equal the target of the other. 

Such partially defined operations may be understood using the notion of [[pullback]].  So, just as an [[algebraic theory]] is defined using a category with finite products, an 'essentially algebraic theory' is defined using a category with finite [[limit|limits]] --- or in other words, finite [[product|products]] and also pullbacks.
