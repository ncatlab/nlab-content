## Statement

[[Gabriel's theorem]] ([Gabriel 72](#Gabriel72)) says that connected [[quivers]] with a [[finite number]] of [[indecomposable object|indecomposable]] [[quiver representations]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] are precisely the _[[Dynkin quivers]]_: those whose underlying [[undirected graph]] is a [[Dynkin diagram]] in the [[ADE classification|ADE series]]

Moreover, the [[indecomposable object|indecomposable]] [[quiver representations]] in this case are [[bijection]] with the positive [[root (in representation theory)|roots]] in the [[root system]] of the [[Dynkin diagram]].
