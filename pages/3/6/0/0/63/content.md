What is called the "BRST complex" in physics literture is the [[L-infinity algebroid|qDGCA]] which is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the [[L-infinity algebroid]] which is the differential version in [[Lie theory]] if the $\infty$-groupoid 

 * whose space of objects is the space of configurations/histories of a given physical system;

 * whose morphisms describe the gauge transformations between these configurations/histories;

 * whose $k$-morphisms descrive the $k$-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations.

The generators of the BRST complex are called

 * in degree 0: _fields_;

 * in degree 1: _ghosts_;

 * in degree 2: _ghosts of ghosts_;

etc.
