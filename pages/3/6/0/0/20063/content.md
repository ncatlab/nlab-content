## Definition

A [[weak factorization system]] $(L,R)$ on a [[locally presentable category]] is **combinatorial** if it is cofibrantly generated by a set of morphisms.  That is, there is a set $I$ of morphisms such that for any morphism $f$, we have $f\in R$ if and only if $f$ has the right lifting property with respect to all $i\in I$.

## Construction

By the [[small object argument]], any set $I$ of morphisms in a locally presentable category generates a combinatorial weak factorization system.

## Properties

* Combinatorial wfs can be both right- and left-lifted along adjunctions; see [[transferred model structure]].

## Related concepts

* A [[combinatorial model category]] is a [[model category]] whose two constituent weak factorization systems are combinatorial.

* A more general notion is an [[accessible weak factorization system]].

* Any combinatorial weak factorization system can be equipped with the structure of an [[algebraic weak factorization system]] (generally in more than one way).
