##Idea

The aim of **formal category theory**  is to axiomatise the constructions of category theory -- [[adjunctions]], [[monads]], [[limits]], etc. -- so that they refer to structures within a generic [[2-category]], and not only [[Cat]].

> The purpose of category theory is to try to describe certain general aspects of the structure of mathematics.  Since category theory is also part of mathematics, this categorical type of description should apply to it as well as to other parts of mathematics. ([Gray 74](#Gray74))

Contexts to develop formal category theory include [[Yoneda structures]], [[proarrow equipments]], and [[KZ doctrines]].
