## Idea

[[Jordan algebras]] were invented to axiomatize some properties of the Jordan product $a \circ b = (a b + b a)/2$ of self-adjoint complex matrices, which serve as [[observables]] in quantum mechanics.  As work proceeded, some researchers found it convenient to focus on another binary operation on self-adjoint matrices, 

$$ U_a (b) = 2 a \circ (a \circ b) - (a \circ a) \circ b = a b a \, . $$

Axiomatizing the properties of this operation led to the definition of a [[quadratic Jordan algebra]].
