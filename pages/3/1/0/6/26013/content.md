## Idea

An _Euler system_ is a collection of classes in [[Galois cohomology]] satisfying certain compatibility conditions. The existence of a nontrivial Euler system can imply bounds on the [[Selmer group]] and thus the theory of Euler systems finds applications in the study of [[special values of L-functions]], for instance in Victor Kolyvagin's work on the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].
