## Idea

A **strict [[inequality relation]]** or **tight apartness relation** $\#$ is an [[apartness relation]] which is also a [[tight relation]]. An **inequality space** is a set with a strict inequality relation. Strict inequalities are contrasted with [[weak inequality]] or [[denial inequality]], which is the [[negation]] of [[equality]]. In the context of [[excluded middle]], every weak inequality is a strict inequality relation, so one simply talks about "inequality". 

## Definition

### In set theory

In [[set theory]], an **inequality space** is a [[set]] $S$ with a [[binary relation]] $\#$ such that 

* for all $a \in S$, $\neg(a \# a)$
* for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $a \# b$ implies $b \# a$
* for all $a \in S$, $b \in S$, and $c \in S$, $a \# c$ implies that either $a \# b$ or $b \# c$
* for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $a = b$ if and only if $\neg(a \# b)$  

### In dependent type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], an **inequality space** is a type $T$ with 

* a type family $a:T, b:T \vdash a \# b \; \mathrm{type}$ 
* a family of terms $a:T, b:T \vdash \mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\mathrm{isProp}(a \# b)$
* a family of terms $a:T \vdash \mathrm{irr}(a):(a \# a) \to \mathbb{0}$
* a family of terms $a:T, b:T \vdash \mathrm{sym}(a, b):(a \# b) \to (b \# a)$
* a family of terms $a:T, b:T, c:T \vdash \mathrm{com}(a, b, c):(a \# c) \to \left[(a \# b) + (b \# c)\right]$
* a family of terms $a:T, b:T \vdash \mathrm{tight}(a, b):\mathrm{isEquiv}(\mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, b))$ 

where $a:T, b:T \vdash \mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, b):(a =_T b) \to ((a \# b) \to \mathbb{0})$ is inductively defined by 

$$a:T \vdash \beta_{\mathrm{idtonotapart}}^{\mathrm{refl}_T}(a):\mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, a)(\mathrm{refl}_T(a)) =_{(a \# a) \to \mathbb{0}} \mathrm{irr}(a)$$

The last condition ensures that the type is an [[h-set]].

## Properties

### Strongly extensional functions

Given two inequality spaces $S$ and $T$, a [[function]] $f\colon S \to T$ is __[[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]]__ if $f(x) \# f(y)$ implies $x \# y$; that is, $f$ reflects apartness. $f$ is a [[strongly injective function|strongly injective]] if $f(x) \# f(y)$ is logically equivalent to $x \# y$. The [[contrapositive]] of the both conditions imply that $f$ preserves equality and is an [[injection]] respectively. 

### Stable and decidable inequality

Strict inequality is stable if it is logical equivalent to [[denial inequality]]; i.e. for all elements $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $a \neq b$ if and only if $a \# b$. Stable strict inequality is simply called "inequality", as there is no need to distinguish between strict inequality and [[denial inequality]] in this case. 

Strict inequality is decidable if for all elements $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $a \# b$ or $a = b$. Decidable strict inequality implies stable strict inequality, so it is usually called decidable inequality. In the context of [[excluded middle]], every strict inequality relation is decidable. 

## The category of inequality spaces

In the category of inequality spaces, [[monomorphisms]] between inequality spaces are strongly extensional functions that preserve strict inequality, or strong [[injections]]. These monomorphisms are [[regular monomorphisms]]. The category of inequality spaces has all (small) [[limits]], [[created limit|created]] by the [[forgetful functor]] to [[Set]]. (For example, $(a,b) \# (x,y)$ iff $a \# x$ or $b \# y$.) Similarly, it has all finite [[coproducts]], and it has [[quotient object|quotients]] of [[equivalence relations]]. In fact, this category is a [[complete category|complete]] [[pretopos]]. It is *not*, however, a [[Grothendieck topos]] (or even a [[topos]] at all), because it doesn\'t have all infinite coproducts. (To be precise, the statement that it has all small coproducts, or even that it has a subobject classifier, seems to be equivalent to excluded middle.)

We can say, however, that it has coproducts indexed by inequality spaces, although to make this precise is a triviality. More interestingly, it has products indexed by inequality spaces; that is, it is (even [[locally cartesian closed category|locally]]) a [[cartesian closed category]]. In particular, given inequality spaces $X$ and $Y$, the set $\StrExt(X,Y)$ of strongly extensional functions from $X$ to $Y$ becomes an inequality space under the rule that $f \# g$ iff $f(x) \# g(x)$ for some $x\colon X$. Finally, the category of inequality spaces has a [[real numbers object]], the [[Dedekind real numbers]]. 

## Foundational status

### In set theory

In [[classical mathematics]], it is true that every [[set]] is an [[inequality space]]. In [[constructive mathematics]], however, not all sets are inequality spaces. Instead, one can add an axiom to the [[foundations of mathematics]] which states that every set is an inequality space. 

**Axiom of inequality spaces**: Every set has a strict inequality relation. 

Alternatively, one could take the strict inequality to be foundational, in which the [[axiom of extensionality]] becomes

**[[axiom of extensionality|Axiom of extensionality]]**: for any set $x$ and $y$, $\neg(x \# y)$ if and only if for all $z$, $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$. 

### In dependent type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], one can make every type into an inequality space by adding the following set of rules to the type theory:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A \vdash a \# b \; \mathrm{type}} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{proptrunc}(a, b):\mathrm{isProp}(a \# b)}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A \vdash \mathrm{irr}(a):(a \# a) \to \mathbb{0}} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{sym}(a, b):(a \# b) \to (b \# a)}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A, c:A \vdash \mathrm{comp}(a, b, c):(a \# c) \to \left[(a \# b) + (b \# c)\right]}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, b):(a =_A b) \to ((a \# b) \to \mathbb{0})}$$ 
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A \vdash \mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, a)(\mathrm{refl}_A(a)) \equiv \mathrm{irr}(a):(a \# a) \to \mathbb{0}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{tight}(a, b):\mathrm{isEquiv}(\mathrm{idtonotapart}(a, b))}$$

This implies [[axiom K]] and [[uniqueness of identity proofs]]. 

### Omniscience principles

There are also generalisations of the [[principles of omniscience]] involving [[inequality spaces]]:

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[decidable tight apartness]], which generalises [[LPO]] and [[analytic LPO]]

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[decidable equality]], which generalises [[WLPO]] and [[analytic WLPO]]

* Every [[inequality space]] has [[stable relation|stable]] [[tight apartness]], which generalises [[Markov's principle]] and [[analytic Markov's principle]]

These are all still weaker than [[excluded middle]] since in general, the [[set of truth values]] is only an [[inequality space]] if and only if [[excluded middle]] holds. 

## In algebra

Since inequality spaces have finite limits, the usual constructions of [[universal algebra]] apply; it\'s straightforward to define inequality [[groups]], inequality [[rings]], and so on.

The various subsets that appear in algebra (such as [[subgroups]], [[ideals]], and [[cosets]]) become less fundamental than certain subsets that are, classically, simply their complements. For example, a left ideal in a ring $R$ is a subset $I$ such that $0 \in I$, $x + y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$, and $x y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$. But a left _[[antiideal]]_ in an inequality ring $R$ is an $\#$-open subset $A$ such that $0 \in A$ is false, $x \in A$ or $y \in A$ whenever $x + y \in A$, and $x \in A$ whenever $x y \in A$.  (The $\#$-openness requirement is automatic if $\neg(0\in A)$ is strengthened to $p\# 0$ for all $p\in A$, using that the ring operations are strongly extensional.)  Note that the complement of an antiideal is an ideal, but not every ideal can be constructively shown to be the complement of an antiideal; so antiideals are more fundamental than ideals, in an inequality ring.

[[prime ideal|Prime ideals]] are even more interesting. A two-sided antiideal $A$ (so also satisfying that $y \in A$ whenever $x y \in A$) is _antiprime_ (or simply _prime_ if no confusion is expected) if $1 \in A$ and $x y \in A$ whenever $x, y \in A$. Now the complement of an antiprime antiideal may *not* be a prime ideal (as normally defined). But in fact, it is antiprime antiideals that are more important in constructive algebra. In particular, an [[integral domain]] in constructive algebra is an inequality ring in which the antiideal of nonzero elements is antiprime.

Any [[apartness relation]] on an inequality space $X$ is the same as the (strongly) [[closed subspace|closed]] [[equivalence relation]] on the discrete locale $X$. This localic perspective on [[apartness relations]] extends naturally to anti-algebra: an antiideal is the same as a *closed* ideal in a discrete localic ring that respects the closed equivalence relation corresponding to $\#$. Equivalently, this is a closed ideal of the $\#$-topology regarded as a (non-discrete) localic ring.  The spatial part of this closed localic ideal is then the ordinary ideal complementary to the antiideal, and so on.  Moreover, since unions of closed sublocales correspond to intersections of their open complements, an antiideal $A$ is antiprime exactly when its corresponding closed localic ideal $\mathsf{C}A$ is "prime" in an appropriate internal sense in [[Loc]], namely that $m^*(\mathsf{C}A) \subseteq (\mathsf{C}A \times R) \cup (R\times \mathsf{C}A)$, where $m:R\times R\to R$ is the multiplication.  The fact that the complement of an antiprime antiideal need not be prime in the usual sense corresponds to the fact that taking the spatial part of sublocales doesn't commute with unions.
