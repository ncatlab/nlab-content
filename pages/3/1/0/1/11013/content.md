on [[foundations of mathematics]] in [[categorical logic]] and the role of [[adjoints]] in the formalization of [[quantifiers]] ([[base change]]). The main point is that the logical operations on [[propositions]]

[[existential quantifier]] $\dashv$ [[context extension]] $\dashv$ [[universal quantifier]]

constitute an [[adjoint triple]]. In [[type theory]] this is lifted from operations on propositions to operations on [[types]], where it becomes

[[dependent sum]] $\dashv$ [[context extension]] $\dashv$ [[dependent product]].

In [[topos theory]] and [[geometry]] this adjoint triple is often know as _[[base change]]_.
