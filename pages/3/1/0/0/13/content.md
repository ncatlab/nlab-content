I am [Toby Bartels](http://tobybartels.name/) (they/them).

My main interests here are the [[foundations]] of mathematics, including [[constructive mathematics]] and how to formalise [[higher category theory]] [[internalization|internally]].  I have a liking for [[centipede mathematics]], which I sometimes take too far, but usually it has applications somewhere.  I also have an aptitude for [[negative thinking]]; my favourite mathematical object is the [[empty set]].  Along these lines, I advocate learning [[order theory]] before [[category theory]], just as one learns category theory before [[higher category theory]]; see [[category theory vs order theory]].

The regulars here may be especially interested in my PhD dissertation, [Higher Gauge Theory I: 2-Bundles](http://tobybartels.name/2bundles/).

I also have [[Toby Bartels:HomePage|my own personal web here]], although not much is on it.
