I am [Toby Bartels](http://toby.bartels.name/).

The readers here may be especially interested in my PhD dissertation, [Higher Gauge Theory I: 2-Bundles](http://toby.bartels.name/2bundles/).

[[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: Toby, I can't figure out what your last edit on [[Froelicher space]] was (#9 -> #10).  Did you change anything that time?

Do you have any ideas on what I ask about in my query boxes on that page.

_Reply_:  I forget.  So I opened the edit box for both versions, copied and saved to separate files, then ran `diff` on them.  Here is the result:

<pre>
37c37
< Fr&#246;licher spaces are examples of [[generalized smooth space|generalised smooth spaces]].  They are also examples of [[space and quantity|generalised spaces]] in the following sense.

> Fr&#246;licher spaces are examples of [[generalized smooth spaces|generalised smooth spaces]].  They are also examples of [[space and quantity|generalised spaces]] in the following sense.
</pre>

(I know that doesn\'t show up right, but I can\'t get it to do what I want, and this is honestly the closest that I can get to what I intend.)

I've noticed before that edits to the target of a link never show up in Instiki\'s diffs; that\'s what happened here.

I have no answers for your query boxes yet.

[[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: Thanks, that's clear enough.  That's been on my "to do" list for a while on that page so thanks for that - and the other cleaning up you've done.

(I'll let you delete this query box)
