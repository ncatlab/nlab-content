I am [Toby Bartels](http://toby.bartels.name/).

If you came to this page by following my name at the bottom of an article, don\'t assume that I wrote that article!  Go back and check the article\'s History to see who wrote it before you send me email about it.  Even if I did write it, it\'s better if you make a comment right on the page, using a [[HowTo|query block]].  (But if you understand that and still want to send me email, then that\'s OK too.)

My main interests here are the [[foundations]] of mathematics, including [[constructive mathematics]] and how to formalise [[higher category theory]] [[internalization|internally]].  I have a liking for [[centipede mathematics]], which I sometimes take too far, but usually it has applications somewhere.  I also have an aptitude for [[negative thinking]]; my favourite mathematical object is the [[empty set]].

The regulars here may be especially interested in my PhD dissertation, [Higher Gauge Theory I: 2-Bundles](http://toby.bartels.name/2bundles/).

I also have [[Toby Bartels:HomePage|my own personal web here]], although not much is on it yet.
