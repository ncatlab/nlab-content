## Definition

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, the __Lie bracket__ of [[vector fields]] $u$ and $v$ can be defined in several ways.

### As commutator of derivations

Since [[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]], we can identify $u$ and $v$ with the corresponding derivations $C^\infty(X)\to C^\infty(X)$.

Taking the [[commutator]] $u v-v u$ of these derivations produces another [[derivation]], which is denoted by $[u,v]$, and which can be identified with a vector field on $X$.

### As a Lie derivative

Alternatively, we can set
$$[u,v]=\mathcal{L}_u v=-\mathcal{L}_v u,$$
where $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the [[Lie derivative]] of a [[vector field]].

## Properties

The real [[vector space]] of [[vector fields]] on $X$ equipped with the Lie bracket forms a [[Lie algebra]].
