## Definition

A [[cardinal]] $\kappa$ is __strongly compact__ if any $\kappa$-complete [[filter]] can be extended to a $\kappa$-complete [[ultrafilter]].

Here a [[filter]] is $\kappa$-complete if it is closed under intersections
of families with fewer than $\kappa$ elements.

## Properties

Strongly compact cardinals are [[measurable cardinals]].

The existence of a [[proper class]] of strongly compact cardinals
implies that images of [[accessible functors]]
are accessible as long as they are [[complete]] or [[cocomplete]].
