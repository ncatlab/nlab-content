#Idea#

Recall that a [[sheaf]] on a [[site]] $S$ is a [[presheaf]] $A \in PSh(S)$ such that for all [[local isomorphism]]s $Y \to X$ in $PSh(S)$ thre induced morphism  $A(X) \to A(Y)$ is an [[isomorphism]].

The presheaf $A$ is called _separated_ if it comes close to satsifying this condition.

#Definition#

A [[presheaf]] $A \in PSh(S)$ with respect to some [[site]] $S$ is **separated** if for all [[local isomorphism]]s $Y \to X$ the induced morphism $Hom(X,A) \to Hom(Y,A)$ is a [[monomorphism]].

As for the [[sheaf]] condition itself, this is equivalent to the same condition evaluated just for [[dense monomorphism]]s.
