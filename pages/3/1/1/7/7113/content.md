## Idea

An _Archimedean ordered field_ is an [[ordered field]] that satisfies the [[archimedean property]].

## Definition

### Using field homomorphisms from the rationals

The [[rational numbers]] are the [[initial]] [[ordered field]], so for every ordered field $F$ there is a field homomorphism $h:\mathbb{Q}\to F$. Since every field homomorphism between ordered fields is an [[injection]], the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is a [[subset]] of the ordered field $F$, and we can suppress the field homomorphism via [[coercion]], such that given $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ one can derive that $q \in F$. Thus, $F$ is _Archimedean_ if for all elements $x \in F$ and $y \in F$, if $x \lt y$, then there exists a rational number $q\in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt q$ and $q \lt y$. 

### Using Dedekind cut-like conditions

A [[real number]] in an [[ordered field]] $F$ is an element $x \in F$ which satisfies the [[Dedekind cut]] axioms:

1. there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q \lt x$
1. there exists a rational number $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt q'$ and $q' \lt x$ implies that $q \lt x$
1. for all rational numbers $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r' \in \mathbb{Q}$, $x \lt r'$ and $r' \lt r$ implies that $x \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt x$ implies that there exists a rational number $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$, such that $q \lt q'$ and $q' \lt x$
1. for all rational numbers $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $x \lt r$ implies that there exists a rational number $r' \in \mathbb{Q}$, such that $x \lt r'$ and $r' \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt x$ and $x \lt r$ implies that $q \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt r$ implies that $q \lt x$ or $x \lt r$

We have the following results:

* The first and second conditions say that every element $x \in F$ is bounded below and above by rational numbers, and thus strictly not an [[infinite]] element. This also implies that there are no infinitesimal elements, because there are no element $x \in F$ whose multiplicative inverse is an infinite element. 

* The fifth and sixth conditions independently imply that every element $x \in F$ is strictly not an [[infinitesimal]] element. 

These four conditions together imply the [[archimedean property]] for the ordered field $F$. 

* The third, fourth, and seventh conditions are always true for all elements $x \in F$ because of transitivity of the [[strict order]] relation. 

* Finally, the eighth condition says that every element $x \in F$ is located, and is true for all elements $x \in F$ because the [[pushout]] of the [[open intervals]] $(q, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, r)$ with canonical inclusions $(q, r) \to (q, \infty)$ and $(q, r) \to (-\infty, r)$ is equivalent to $F$ itself. 

Thus, an **Archimedean ordered field** is an ordered field $F$ where every element $x \in F$ is a real number. 

Note that this definition is not the same as saying that $F$ contains every [[real number]] - the latter definition results in the [[Dedekind real numbers]], which is the union of all Archimedean ordered fields and the [[terminal object|terminal]] Archimedean ordered field. 

## Properties

Every Archimedean ordered field is a [[dense linear order]]. This means that the [[Dedekind completion]] of every Archimedean ordered field is the field of all [[real numbers]]. 

### Dedekind cuts

Every element $x \in F$ in an Archimedean ordered field satisfies the axioms of [[Dedekind cuts]]:

1. there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q \lt x$
1. there exists a rational number $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt q'$ and $q' \lt x$ implies that $q \lt x$
1. for all rational numbers $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r' \in \mathbb{Q}$, $x \lt r'$ and $r' \lt r$ implies that $x \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt x$ implies that there exists a rational number $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$, such that $q \lt q'$ and $q' \lt x$
1. for all rational numbers $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $x \lt r$ implies that there exists a rational number $r' \in \mathbb{Q}$, such that $x \lt r'$ and $r' \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt x$ and $x \lt r$ implies that $q \lt r$
1. for all rational numbers $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $q \lt r$ implies that $q \lt x$ or $x \lt r$

We have the following results:

* The first condition is always true because for all $x \in F$, we have $x - 1 \in F$, and by the Archimedean principle there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x - 1 \lt q \lt x$. 

* The second condition is always true because for all $x \in F$, we have $x + 1 \in F$, and by the Archimedean principle there exists a rational number $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt r \lt x + 1$. 

* The fifth condition is always true because for all $x \in F$ and $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, if $q \lt x$, then by the Archimedean principle there exists a rational number $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q \lt q' \lt x$. 

* The sixth condition is always true because for all $x \in F$ and $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, if $x \lt r$, then by the Archimedean principle there exists a rational number $q' \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt r' \lt r$. 

* The third, fourth, and seventh conditions are always true for all elements $x \in F$ because of transitivity of the [[strict order]] relation. 

* Finally, the eighth condition says that every element $x \in F$ is located, and is true for all elements $x \in F$ because the [[union]] $(q, \infty) \cup (-\infty, r)$ of the [[open intervals]] $(q, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, r)$ is the [[improper subset]] of $F$. 

### Continuous and differentiable structure

Every Archimedean ordered field is a [[differentiable space]]:

#### Pointwise continuous functions

Let $F$ be an Archimedean ordered field. A function $f:F \to F$ is __continuous at a point__ $c \in F$ if 

$$isContinuousAt(f, c) \coloneqq \forall \epsilon \in (0, \infty). \forall x \in F. \exists \delta \in (0, \infty). (\vert x - c \vert \lt \delta) \implies (\vert f(x) - f(c) \vert \lt \epsilon)$$

$f$ is __pointwise continuous__ in $F$ if it is continuous at all points $c$:
$$isPointwiseContinuous(f) \coloneqq \forall c \in F. isContinuousAt(f, c)$$

The set of all pointwise continuous functions is defined as 

$$C^0(F) \coloneqq \{f \in F \to F \vert isPointwiseContinuous(f)\}$$

#### Pointwise differentiable functions

Let $F$ be an Archimedean ordered field. A function $f:F \to F$ is __differentiable at a point__ $c \in F$ if 

$$isDifferentiableAt(f, c) \coloneqq isContinuousAt(f, c) \times \exists L \in F. \forall \epsilon \in (0, \infty). \forall x \in F. \exists \delta \in (0, \infty). \forall h \in (-\delta, 0) \cup (0, \delta). \left| \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} - L \right| \lt \epsilon$$

$f$ is __pointwise differentiable__ in $F$ if it is differentiable at all points $c$:
$$isPointwiseDifferentiable(f) \coloneqq \forall c \in F. isDifferentiableAt(f, c)$$

The set of all pointwise differentiable functions is defined as 

$$D^0(F) \coloneqq \{f \in F \to F \vert isPointwiseDifferentiable(f)\}$$

### Admissibility 

Let $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$ be a [[subobject|sub]]-[[sigma-frame|$sigma$-frame]] of the [[frame of truth values]]. Then an Archimedean ordered field $F$ is [[admissible Archimedean ordered field|admissible for $\Sigma$]] if the [[pseudo-order]] $(-)\lt(-):F \times F \to \Omega$ restricts to a binary function $(-)\lt(-):F \times F \to \Sigma$. 

## Category of Archimedean ordered fields

The **category of Archimedean ordered fields** is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are Archimedean ordered fields and whose [[morphisms]] are [[ring homomorphisms]] between Archimedean ordered fields. (Every ring homomorphism between Archimedean ordered field can be proven to be a [[strictly monotonic]] field [[homomorphism]]). 

The category of Archimedean ordered fields is a [[thin category]]. It is also a [[skeletal category]] and a [[gaunt category]], and impredicatively is the subset of the [[power set]] of [[real numbers]] which consists of all the Archimedean ordered [[subfields]] of the real numbers. 

The [[initial object]] in the category of Archimedean ordered fields is the [[rational numbers]] and the [[terminal object]] in the category of Archimedean ordered fields is the ([[Dedekind real number|Dedekind]]) [[real numbers]]. 

More generally, one can consider, for every sub-$\sigma$-frame $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$ of the [[frame of truth values]], the subcategory of Archimedean ordered fields which are admissible for $\Sigma$ and ring homomorphisms between Archimedean ordered fields admissible for $\Sigma$. While the rational numbers are still the [[initial object]] in this category, the [[terminal object]] in this object is a version $\mathbb{R}_\Sigma$ of the [[Dedekind real numbers]], which are constructed using [[Dedekind cuts]] valued in $\Sigma$. In the larger category of all Archimedean ordered fields, the ring homomorphism $\mathbb{R}_\Sigma \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}_D$ is not provably an [[isomorphism]]. 

## Examples

Archimedean ordered fields include

* [[rational numbers]]
* [[real closed fields]]
* [[real numbers]]

In [[constructive mathematics]], one has the different notions of real numbers

* [[Cauchy real numbers]] (terminal Archimedean ordered field where every element merely has a [[locator]])
* [[HoTT book real numbers]] (initial [[Cauchy complete]] Archimedean ordered field)
* [[Dedekind real numbers]] (terminal Archimedean ordered field, also initial [[Dedekind complete]] Archimedean ordered field)

These notions of real numbers are the same if every Dedekind real number merely has a [[locator]], so that the Cauchy real numbers are Dedekind complete. Both [[excluded middle]] and [[countable choice]] imply that every Dedekind real number has a [[locator]]. 

Non-Archimedean ordered fields include

* [[finite fields]]

* [[complex numbers]]

* [[p-adic numbers]]

* [[surreal numbers]]
