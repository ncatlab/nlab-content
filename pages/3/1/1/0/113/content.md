#Definition#

The **source object** of a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in some [[category]] is the [[object]] $x$. 

Given a category $C$ with objects $C_0$ and morphisms $C_1$, a **source morphism** is a map $s:C_1\to C_0$ that maps each morphism to its source object.

The source is also called the 'domain'.
