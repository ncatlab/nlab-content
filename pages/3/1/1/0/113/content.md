#Definition#

The **source object** of a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in some [[category]] is the [[object]] $x$. 

Given a category [[internal category|internal to]] $C$ with object of objects $C_0$ and object of morphisms $C_1$, a **source morphism** is a morphism $s:C_1\to C_0$ that maps each morphism in $C_1$ to its source object in $C_0$.

The source is also called the 'domain'.
