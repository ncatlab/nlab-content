A __flag__ in a vector space or a projective space is a 'nest' of subspaces, one of each dimension
from $0$ to $n-1$. Given a field $k$, the space of all flags in $n$-dimensional $k$-vector space has a structure of a projective $k$-variety. If $k$ is the field o real or complex numbers then it has a structure of a smooth manifold. It can be considered as the homogeneous space $SL(n,k)/B$ where $B$ is the subgroup of lower (or upper if you like) triangular matrices. The __generalized flag variety__ is the coset space $G/K\cong G^{\mathbb{C}}/B$ where $G$ is a compact Lie group, $K$ its maximal compact, $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ the complexification of $G$ which is complex semisimple group and $B$ its Borel subgroup. It is a special case of the bigger family of coset spaces of semisimple groups modulo parabolics which includes for example grassmanians. There are quantum, noncommutative and infinite-dimensional generalizations. Flag varieties have rich combinatorial and geometric structure and play an important role in [[representation theory]] and [[integrable systems]].
