A __[[flag]]__ in a [[vector space]] or a [[projective space]] is a 'nest' of subspaces, one of each dimension
from $0$ to $n-1$. Given a [[field]] $k$, the space of all flags in an $n$-dimensional $k$-vector space has the structure of a [[projective variety]] over $k$, the __flag variety__. If $k$ is the field of real or complex numbers, then it has a structure of a smooth [[manifold]]. It can be considered as the [[homogeneous space]] $SL(n,k)/B$ where $B$ is the subgroup of lower (or upper if you like) triangular matrices. By the [Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization procedure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process), one shows the isomorphism as real manifolds $SL(n,\mathbb{C})/B\cong SU(n)/T$ where $T$ is the subgroup of the diagonal $n\times n$-matrices. 

More generally, the __generalized flag variety__ is the complex projective variety obtained as the coset space $G/T\cong G^{\mathbb{C}}/B$ where $G$ is a [[compact Lie group]], $T$ its [[maximal torus]], $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ the [[complexification]] of $G$, which is a complex semisimple group, and $B\subset G^{\mathbb{C}}$ is the [[Borel subgroup]]. It has a structure of a compact Kaehler manifold. It is a special case of the bigger family of coset spaces of semisimple groups modulo parabolics which includes for example [[grassmanian]]s. There are quantum, noncommutative and infinite-dimensional generalizations. Flag varieties have rich combinatorial and geometric structure and play an important role in [[representation theory]] and [[integrable systems]].
