A __[[flag]]__ in a [[vector space]] or a [[projective space]] is a 'nest' of subspaces, one of each dimension
from $0$ to $n-1$. Given a [[field]] $k$, the space of all flags in an $n$-dimensional $k$-vector space has the structure of a [[projective variety]] over $k$. If $k$ is the field of real or complex numbers, then it has a structure of a smooth [[manifold]]. It can be considered as the [[homogeneous space]] $SL(n,k)/B$ where $B$ is the subgroup of lower (or upper if you like) triangular matrices. The __generalized flag variety__ is the coset space $G/K\cong G^{\mathbb{C}}/B$ where $G$ is a [[compact Lie group]], $K$ its maximal compact, $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ the complexification of $G$ which is complex semisimple group and $B$ its [[Borel subgroup]]. It is a special case of the bigger family of coset spaces of semisimple groups modulo parabolics which includes for example [[grassmanian]]s. There are quantum, noncommutative and infinite-dimensional generalizations. Flag varieties have rich combinatorial and geometric structure and play an important role in [[representation theory]] and [[integrable systems]].

In '$G$ is a compact Lie group, $K$ its maximal compact', $K$ is the maximal compact *what*?  The phrase that I know best is 'maximal compact subgroup', but that is $G$ itself if $G$ is compact.  Is it the maximal compact something else?, or might $G$ not be compact?  ---Toby
