* [[Roland OmnÃ¨s]],

  _Converging Realities: Toward a common philosophy of physics and
mathematics_

  Princeton University Press, 2005

on the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and the [[philosophy of physics]].

A review by [[David Corfield]] is here: _[pdf](http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/corfield/omnes.pdf)_

The thesis of the book -- called _physism_ -- is the following (from p. 215)

> There are basic [[axioms]] for [[logic]] and [[mathematics]]. These axioms are laws of [[physics]]. They are recognized through two inseparable criteria: their fecundity in the construction of mathematics and their necessity for a statement of the law of physics. Their fecundity can be explained in view of the universality, subtlety, and richness of the laws: the basic axioms must be fecund enough to allow a statement of the laws in the language of mathematics. Conversely, they generate every possible field of mathematics. New laws, new axioms, new fields, are possible and they may be discovered by further research. [[consistency|Consistency]] is equally necessary in mathematics and in the laws of physics, which are inseparable. Consistency cannot be explained, but it stands as one of the two criteria of [[truth]]. The other one is [[experiment|experimental]] falsification of a mathematical proposition purporting to express a law of nature.
