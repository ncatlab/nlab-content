> this entry is going to contain some discussion of models of [[elliptic cohomology]] that are analogous to how [[integral cohomology]] is modeled by [[line bundle]]s and [[bundle gerbe]]s, etc. and how [[K-theory]] is modeled by [[vector bundle]]s.

For the moment we have just the following exposition:

It is an old idea that analogous to how [[differential K-theory]] is modeled by parallel transport in [[vector bundle]]s and hence by [[functor]]s $Bord_1(X) \t Vect$,   [[elliptic cohomology]] should somehow be modeled by functors $Bord_2(X) \to Vect$, where $Bord_2(X)$ is a 1-category of [[cobordism]]s equipped with maps to $X$.

[[Stephan Stolz]] and [[Peter Teichner]] have initiated a prrogram studying this in the article [[What is an elliptic object?]]. 

The fundamental result of this program so far is that there is a useful notion of 2d [[FQFT]] over $X$ such that its [[partition function]] is indeed [[topological modular form]]-valued, so that it is a candidate for a model of [[tmf]].

The following is going to be an exposition of this partial result:
