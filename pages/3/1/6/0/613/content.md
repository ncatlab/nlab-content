The [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of a space.

The fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a topological space $X$ is suppossed to be the [[infiniy-groupoid]] whose $k$-morphisms are $k$-dimensional paths in $X$. Concrete realizations depend onthe model of [[infinity-category]] or [[omega-category]] chosen:

* In the context of $\infty$-groupoids modeled as [[Kan complex]]es, the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid is simply the [[simplicial set]] familiar as the _singlular simplicial complex_ $S(X)$ of a space, where $S(X)^n = Top(\Delta^n, X)$
with $\Delta^n$ denoting the standard topological $n$-[[simplex]] (familiar from [[geometric realization]]).

* The definition of [[Trimble n-category]] has the concept of fundamental $n$-groupoid built right into it.

* (... Batanins weak fundamental $\omega$-groupoid)

* (.. strict versions, such as [[Ronnie Brown]]s ...)

*  etc. pp.

* The fundamental $\infty$-groupoid plays a crucial role in the [[homotopy hypothesis]].
