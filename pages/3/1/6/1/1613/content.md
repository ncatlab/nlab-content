## Idea

The FFRS-formalism (after Fr&#246;hlich, Fuchs, [[Ingo Runkel|Runkel]], [[Christoph Schweigert|Schweigert]]) is a [[state sum model]] description of the topological part of rational 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]].

It proceeds by constructing a kind of [[holographic principle of higher category theory|boundary field theory]] to the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]]: given a [[modular tensor category]] $C$ the a 2-dimensional [[TQFT]] which is such that

* if the MTC $C$ is equivalent to a [[representation category]] of a [[vertex operator algebra]], one can construct an identification of the linear map assigned by the construction to a surface to an element in the space of [[conformal block]]s of that surface.

  * A conformal block is a function that depends onthe conformal structure on the surface, so that after this identification the construction yields an assignment of data to conformal surfaces. It is well known that a CFT assigns to a surface a conformal block in this way. What the FFRS prescription achieves is that it provides a way to pick all these conformal blocks in such a way that they actually satisfy the [[sewing constraint|sewing law]], i.e. that they actually conspire to yields a functor on conformal cobordisms.
