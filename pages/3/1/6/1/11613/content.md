## Idea

A _[[domain specific programming language]]_ is one designed for  a specialized kind ("domain") of applications. A _domain specific embedded programming language_ (DSEL) is a domain specific language realized "inside" a general-purpose high level ([[type theory|typed]]) [[programming language]].

## {#RelationToSyntheticMathematics} Relation to synthetic mathematics
 
 
There is at least some similarity between DSELs and [[synthetic mathematics]], see for instance ([Hudak 98, section 3.2](#Hudak98)). In ([Hudak 98, figure 2](#Hudak98)) this shows aspects of a real-world DSL for "geometric region analysis" embedded in [[Haskell]] which under the [[relation between type theory and category theory]]/[[computational trinitarianism]] one immediately recognizes as a fragment of [[synthetic geometry]].

### Quantum programming
 {#QuantumProgramming}

Many existing [[quantum programming languages]] are actually domain-specific languages for the description of [[quantum circuits]], and as such many are embedded in ambient [[type theories]].


For instance:

* *[[Quipper]]* is embedded into into [[Haskell]] &lbrack;[Green, Lumsdaine, Ross, Selinger & Valiron (2013)](Quipper#GLRSV13)&rbrack;;

* *[[QWIRE]]* has been embedded into [[Coq]] ([Rand, Paykin & Zdancewic (2018)](QWIRE#RandPaykinZdancewic18)) and [[homotopy type theory]] &lbrack;[Paykin & Zdancewic (2019)](QWIRE#PaykinZdancewic19)&rbrack;.

* [[CoqQ]] is another quantum programming language embedded in [[Coq]] &lbrack;Ying et al. (2022)&rbrack;

See also [Rennela & Staton (2020)](#RennelaStaton17) for more general discussion.
