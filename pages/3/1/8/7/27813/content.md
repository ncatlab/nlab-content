## Idea

The *Bochner linearization theorem* &lbrack;[Bochner 1945](#Bochner1945)&rbrack; states that for a [[differentiable map|differentiable]] [[group action]] of a [[compact Lie group]] on a [[differentiable manifold]] there exists around each [[fixed point]] a (similarly differentiable) local  [[coordinate chart]] on which the action is [[linear representation|linear]].

(The analogous statement for [[analytic manifolds]] and [[analytic function|analytic]] [[group actions]] is attributed by [Bochner 1945](#Bochner1945) to [[Henri Cartan]], referencing [Martin 1944](#Martin44).)

This linearization theorem is the special case (for [[fixed loci]] of [[dimension of a manifold|dimension]]$=0$) of the existence of *[[equivariant tubular neighbourhood|equivariant tubular neighbourhoods]]*, see there for more.
