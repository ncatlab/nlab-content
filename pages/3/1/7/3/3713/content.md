## Idea

What is called **geometrical optics** is an approximate theoretical treatment of [[wave]] [[optics]] in the short wavelength limit. The [[wave equation]] of physical optics is thus replaced by the so called **eikonal equation**.

A formal analogue to this limit in [[quantum mechanics]] is the [[semiclassical approximation]]. 

Integrals involving exponential function with rapidly oscillating phase have main contributions close to the classical paths which in optics correspond to the light rays of geometric optics. However the geometric optics can tell much more than the crude light ray representation, for example the asymptotic behaviour of light near caustics and phase jumps when passing through focal points.
