
Hermann Grassmann was a German polymath, 1809-1877. Among many other accomplishments, an early inventor of [[linear algebra]] and notably of [[Grassmann algebra]] ([[exterior algebra]], hence [[superalgebra]]), which he laid out in his book _[[Ausdehnungslehre]]_.

From [Drew Armstrong](https://plus.google.com/103061162497127117651/posts/f4HHK1XhUL1):

> Perhaps owing to the abstraction of his work, he was not recognized by the mathematical community and was more famous during his lifetime for his work in philology (including a translation of the Rig Veda). Despite his failure to achieve mathematical success, Grassmann never doubted that his work was significant. Here's a striking quote from the preface of the 1862 second edition of the _[[Ausdehnungslehre]]_:

>> {#CompletelyConvinced} I remain completely confident that the labour I have expended on the science presented here and which has demanded a significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. But I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) that even if this work should again remain unused for another seventeen years or even longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still that time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit. I know that if I also fail to gather around me (as I have until now desired in vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate to develop and enrich them further, yet there will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and will enter into a living communication with contemporary developments. For truth is eternal and divine.

Grassmann's ideas were finally studied in

* Hermann Hankel, _Vorlesungen über die Complexen Zahlen und ihre Functionen_, Leipzig: Leopold Voss, 1867. 

His ideas were developed by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who turned Grassmann algebras into _[[Clifford algebras]]_ in 

* [[William Clifford]], _Applications of Grassmann's extensive algebra_, American Journal of Mathematics 1 (4): 350&#8211;358. (1878). doi:[10.2307/2369379](https://doi.org/10.2307/2369379). 

Today [[Grassmann algebra]] is ubiquituous in [[differential geometry]] ([[de Rham algebra]], [[supergeometry]]) and [[superalgebra]]. In fact, Grassmann had invented the [[signs in supergeometry|sign rule]] of [[supercommutative superalgebra]], which was fully appreciated only in the second half of the 20th century:

This way Grassmann's prediction on the eventual impact of his work did become true. From [[Freeman Dyson]], _Missed opportunities_ ([doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1972-12971-9](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9904-1972-12971-9)):

> In  the  year  1844 two  remarkable  events  occurred,  the  publication  by   Hamilton of  his  discovery  of  [[quaternions]],  and  the  publication  by Grassmann of  his  "[[Ausdehnungslehre]]."  With  the  advantage  of  hindsight  we  can  see  that  Grassmann's  was  the  greater  contribution  to   mathematics,  containing  the  germ  of  many  of  the  concepts  of  modern algebra,  and  including  vector  analysis  as a  special  case. However, Grassmann  was an  obscure  high-school  teacher  in Stettin, while Hamilton  was the  world-famous  mathematician  whose  official  titles  occupy  six  lines  of  print  after  his name at the beginning  of his 1844 paper.  So it  is regrettable,  but  not surprising,  that  quaternions  were  hailed  as  a  great  discovery, while Grassmann  had  to  wait  23  years  before  his  work  received  any recognition  at  all  from  professional  mathematicians.  When  Grassmann's  work  finally became  known,  mathematicians  were  divided  into  quaternionists and antiquaternionists, and  were spending more energy in polemical arguments  for  and  against  quaternions  than  in  trying  to  understand how  Grassmann  and  Hamilton  might  be  fitted  together  into  a  larger scheme  of  things.


Grassmann also had a profound influence on the thought of [[Gottlob Frege]]. See Sec. 2.1.1 of
