## Idea

A symbol in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] to indicate that a particular variable is being initialized or assigned a value or that a particular symbol is being defined.

One sometimes distinguishes between assignment operators which allow reassignment, with what are known as [[single assignment operators]], which do not allow reassignment. 

The assignment operator in purely [[functional programming]] languages like [[Haskell]] amd [[Agda]] is an example of a single assignment operator. As purely functional programming languages can be represented in [[type theory]], and every [[foundations of mathematics]] could also be represented in type theory, the assignment operators used in [[definitions]] in mathematics, such as $\coloneqq$, are single assignment operators; see [[definition]] for more details.
