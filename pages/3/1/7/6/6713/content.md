## Idea

An abstractly defined $n$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] is a consistent assignment of [[state]]-space and correlators to $n$-dimensional [[cobordism]]s with certain structure (topological structure, conformal structure, Riemannian structure, etc. see [[FQFT]]/[[AQFT]]). In an _open-closed QFT_ the cobordisms are allowed to have boundaries. 

In this abstract formulation of QFT a **D-brane** is a type of data assigned by the QFT to boundaries of cobordisms. 

### In $2d$ rational CFT

A well understood class of examples is this one: among all 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]] that case of _full rational 2d CFT_ has been understood completely, using [[FFRS-formalism]]. It is then a theorem that full 2-rational CFTs are classified by 

1. a [[modular tensor category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (to be thought of as being the category of representaitons of the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d CFT);

1. a special symmetric [[Frobenius algebra]] object $A$ [[internalization|internal]] to $\mathcal{C}$.

In this formulation a type of **brane** of the theory is precisely an $A$-[[module]] in $\mathcal{C}$ (an $A$-[[bimodule]] is a [[bi-brane]] or _defect line_ ):

the 2d cobordisms with boundary on which the theory defined by $A \in \mathcal{C}$ carry as extra structure on their connected boundary pieces a label given by an equivalence class of an $A$-module in $\mathcal{C}$. The assignment of the CFT to such a cobordism with boundary is obtained by

* triangulating the cobordism, 

* labeling all internal edges by $A$

* labelling all boundary pieces by the $A$-module

* all vertices where three internal edges meet by the multiplication operation 

* and all points where an internal edge hits a moundary by the corresponding [[action]] morphism 

* and finally evaluating the resulting [[string diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

So in this abstract algebraic formulation of QFT on the worldvolume, a brane is just the datum assigned by the QFT to the boundary of a cobordism. But abstractly defined QFTs may arise from [[quantization]] of [[sigma model]]s. This gives these boundary data a geometric interpretation in some space. This we discuss in the next section.

### In $2d$ TFT

Another case where the branes of a QFT are under good mathematical control is [[TCFT]]: the [[(infinity,1)-category]]-version of a 2d [[TQFT]].

Particularly the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] are well understood.

* the branes of the B-model ("B-branes") form the the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[chain complex]]es of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on the target space (often considered just in terms of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]], the [[derived category]] of quasicoherent sheaves);

*  the branes of the A-model form the [[Fukaya category]] of the target space.



* the category of D-branes of the A-model on a symplectic [[Landau-Ginzburg model]], is a [[Fukaya-Seidel category]];

* the category of D-branes of the B-model on a complex Landau-Ginzburg model is a category of [[matrix factorization]]s.



There is also a mathematical structure called _[[string topology]]_  with D-branes. At present this is more "string inspired" than actually derived from string theory, though.

### In terms of geometric data of the $\sigma$-model background 

An abstractly defined QFT (as a consistent assignment of state spaces and propagators to cobordisms as in [[FQFT]]) may be obtained by [[quantization]] from _geometric data_ :

Sich a _[[sigma-model]] QFT_ is the [[quantization]] of an [[action functional]] on a space of maps $\Sigma \to X$ from a cobordims ("worldvolume") $\Sigma$ to some target space $X$ that may carry further geoemtric data such as a [[Riemannian metric]],  or other background [[gauge field]]s.

One may therefore try to match the geometric data on $X$ that encodes the $\sigma$-model with the algebraic data of the [[FQFT]] that results after quantization. This gives a geometric interpretation to many of the otherwise purely abstract algebraic properties of the worldvolume QFT.

It turns out that if one checks which geometric data corresponds to the $A$-modules in the above discussion, one finds that these tend to come from structures that look at least roughly like _submanifolds_ of the target space $X$. And typically these submanifolds themselves carry their own background [[gauge field]] data.

A well-understood case is the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]]: for this the target space $X$ is a simple [[Lie group]] $X = G$ and the background field is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] (a [[bundle gerbe]]) on $G$, representing the background field that is known as the [[Kalb-Ramond field]].

In this case it turns out that branes for the sigma model on $X$ are given in the smplest case by conjugacy classes $D \subset G$ inside the group, and that these carry [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundle]] with the twist given by the Kalb-Ramond background bundle. These vector bundles are known in the [[string theory]] literature as _[[Chan-Paton vector bundles]]_ . The geometric intuition is that a QFT with certain boundary condition comes form a quantization of spaces of maps $\Sigma \to G$ that are restricted to take the boundary of $\Sigma$ to these submanifolds.

More generally, one finds that the geometric data that corresponds to the branes in the algebraically defined 2d QFT is given by cocycles in the twisted [[differential K-theory]] of $G$. These may be quite far from having a direct interpretation as submanifolds of $G$.

The case of rational 2d CFT considered so far is only the best understood of a long sequence of other examples. Here the collection of all [[D-branes]] -- identified with the colleciton of all internal modules over an internal frobenius algebra, forms an ordinary [[category]].

More generally, at least for 2-dimensional [[TQFT]]s analogous considerations yield not just categories but [[stable (âˆž,1)-categories]] of boundary condition objects. For instance for what is called the [[B-model]] 2-d [[TQFT]] the category of [[D-branes]] is the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on some Calabi-Yau space.

Starting with Kontsevich's [[homological algebra]] reformulation of [[homological mirror symmetry|mirror symmetry]] the study of (derived) D-brane categories has become a field in its own right in pure mathematics.

... lots of further things to say ...

## Properties

### Characterization in terms of Dirac structures

D-branes may be identified with [[Dirac structures]] on 
a [[Courant Lie 2-algebroid]] over spacetime related to the [[type II geometry]] ([Asakawa-Sasa-Watamura](#AsakawaSasaWatamura)). See at _[[Dirac structure]]_ for more on this.

### D-brane charge
 {#DBraneCharge}

In analogy to how in [[electromagnetism]] [[magnetic charge]] is given by a class in [[ordinary cohomology]], so D-brane charge is given in ([[twisted K-theory|twisted]]) [[K-theory]], or, if preferred, in its image under the [[Chern character]].

The [[Chan-Paton bundle]] carried by a D-brane defines a class in [[twisted K-theory]] on the D-brane [[worldvolume]] and the D-brane charge is the push-forward ([[Umkehr map]]) of this class to [[spacetime]], using a [[K-orientation]] of the embedding of the D-brane (a [[spin^c structure]]).

More in detail this means the following ([BMRS2](#BMRS2)).

Let $X$ be a manifold regarded as [[spacetime]] and $i \colon Q \hookrightarrow X$ a [[submanifold]] regarded as the [[worldvolume]] of a D-brane. For 
$\nabla_B \colon X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}$ the [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] which models the [[background gauge field|background]] [[B-field]], write $\chi_B \colon X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ for the underlying [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]]. 

The corresponding [[Chan-Paton bundle]] (a [[twisted bundle|twisted]] [[line bundle]] for the case of a single D-brane) is the trivialization $\xi$ in 

$$
  \array{
    && Q
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow_{\xi} && X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\chi_B}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq 
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && Q
    \\
    & \swarrow &\downarrow& \searrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    \ast &\swArrow_{\xi}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i^\ast \chi_B}} &\swArrow_{id}& X
    \\
    & \searrow &\downarrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\chi_B}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Assuming that $i \colon Q \to X$ is [[K-orientation|K-oriented]] in that for instance $X$ has a [[spin-structure]] and $Q$ a [[spin^c-structure]], then under the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] [[functor]] $C^\ast$ this is incarnated as a [[Hilbert bimodule]] which defines a class in [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[operator K-theory]], realized as the following comoposite in [[KK-theory]]

$$
  \mathbb{C}
   \stackrel{\Gamma(\xi)}{\to}
  C(Q)_{i^\ast \chi_B}
   \stackrel{i_!}{\to}
  C(X)_{\chi_B}
  \,,
$$

where 

* $C(Q)$ and $C(X)$ are the [[C*-algebra|C*-]][[algebras of functions]] ([[vanishing at infinity]]) on the D-brane and on [[spacetime]], respectively;

* $C(X)_{\chi_B}$ is the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of [[sections]] of $\chi_B$ regarded as a [[centrally extended groupoid]] over a [[Cech groupoid]] [[resolution]] of $X$ which supports a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] for $\chi_B$, and similarly for $C(Q)_{i^\ast \chi B}$ and the pullback/restriction $i^\ast \chi_B$ of the background B-field to the brane;

* $i!$ is the push-forward ([[Umkehr map]]) dual to $i^\ast \colon C(X)_{\chi_B} \to C(Q)_{i^\ast \chi_B}$, realizes as a [[KK-theory]] class

  $$
    D_Q = i! = \in KK(C(Q), C(X)_{\chi_B})
    \,.
  $$

The corresponding **D-brane charge** in KK-theory is the resulting composite (relative [[index]])

$$
  i_!(\xi) =  D_Q(\xi) \in KK(\mathbb{C}, C(X)_{\chi_B}) \simeq K^{[\chi_b]}(X)
$$

in [[twisted K-theory]]. Traditionally only the image of this under the [[Chern character]] 

$$
  ch \colon KK \to HL
$$

in real cohomology/[[cyclic cohomology]] is considered, $ch(D_Q(\xi))$. Moreover, traiditonally one thinks of first applying $ch$ to $\xi$ and then pushing forward in $HL$. By the [[C*-algebra|C*-algebraic]] [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]] this gives the [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] expression 

$$
  ch(D_Q(\xi)) \otimes_{C(X)_{\chi_B}} Todd
  \in HL
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the relative [[Todd class]]. This is the form the D-brane charge was originally found in the physics literature and in which it is still often given.

(In ([BMRS2, section 8](#BMRS2)) this is discussed for the untwisted case.)
