_Doctrinal Adjunction_ is the title of a 1974 paper by [[Max Kelly]] that gives conditions under which [[adjunction|adjoint morphisms]] $f \dashv u$ in a [[2-category]] $K$, and additionally the unit and counit, may be lifted to $T$-Alg, for some [[2-monad]] $T$ on $K$.  Here $T$-Alg is the 2-category of strict $T$-algebras, lax $T$-morphisms and $T$-transformations.

There is a bijection between 2-cells $\bar u$ making $(u,\bar u)$ a lax $T$-morphism and 2-cells $\tilde f$ making $(f,\tilde f)$ a colax $T$-morphism; it is given by taking [[mates]] with respect to the adjunctions $T f \dashv T u$ and $f \dashv u$.

The proof relies solely on the properties of the mate correspondence.

Further, for the unit and counit of the adjunction $f \dashv u$ to be $T$-transformations, and hence for the adjunction to live in $T$-Alg, it is necessary and sufficient that $\tilde f$ have an inverse $\bar f$ that makes $(f,\bar f)$ into a lax $T$-morphism.

Again, the proof hinges on the properties of mates:  we take the conditions for the unit and counit to be $T$-transformations and pass to mates wrt $T f \dashv T u$ and $1 \dashv 1$.  Noting that $\tilde f$ is the mate of $\bar u$, the conditions are seen to be equivalent to requiring that $\bar f$ and $\tilde f$ are mutually inverse.

It follows that $(f, \bar f) \dashv (u, \bar u)$ in $T$-Alg if and only if $f \dashv u$ in $K$ and $\bar f$ has inverse $\tilde f$ = the mate of $\bar u$.
