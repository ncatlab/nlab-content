#Definition#

By $CartSp$ we denote the category

* whose objects are the [[cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ -- the [[real line]] to its $n$th cartesian power -- equipped with their standard smooth structure;

* whose morphisms are all smooth (infinitely differentiable) maps between these spaces.

So $CartSp$ is in particular the full [[subcategory]] of [[Diff]] consisting of the spaces for $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.


#Remarks#

* Let $CartSp_{pr} \hookrightarrow CartSp$ be the subcategory of $CartSp$ whose morphisms are restricted to be the standard injections and projections on $CartSp$. 
If we write [[FinSet]] for the skeletal version of the category of finite sets, with objects identified with the natural numbers, then $CartSp_{pr} \simeq FinSet$.

* $CartSp$ appear as test objects in the context of [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth spaces]] and [[generalized smooth algebra|generalized smooth algebras]].

* One can define $Cart Sp$ with other choices of morphism; see [[cartesian space]] for some idea.
