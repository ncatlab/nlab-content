#Definition#

A **diagram** in a [[category]] $C$ is simply a [[functor]] $F: J \to C$. The category $J$ is called the **shape** or **index category** of the diagram, and is typically understood to be a [[small category]]. 

For example:
* Every category $C$ admits a unique diagram whose shape is the empty ([[initial object|initial]]) category, which is called the **empty diagram** in $C$.
* Specifying a diagram in $C$ whose shape is the [[terminal category]] $1$ is the same as specifying an [[object]] of $C$, the image of the unique object of $1$. (See [[global element]])
* A [[span]] is a diagram whose shape is a category with just three objects and single morphisms from one of the objects to the other two.
* Dually, a [[cospan]] is a diagram whose shape is [[opposite category|opposite]] to the shape of a span.
* A parallel pair of [[morphism|morphisms]] (two morphisms with a common [[source]] and a common [[target]]) is a diagram whose shape is a category with two objects and two morphisms from one to the other.
