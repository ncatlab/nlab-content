## Idea

In [[homotopy theory]] and in [[higher category theory]] by _rectification_ one (usually, often) means the equivalent presentation of a [[homotopy]]-[[coherence|coherent]] structure equivalently by apparently more naive "strict" data. 

Many or most rectification statements are examples of the general _[Rectification theorem for algebras over an operad](model+structure+on+algebras+over+an+operad#RectificationOfAlgebras)_ which states sufficient conditions for the category of [[algebras over an operad]] to already be [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to that of the corresponding [[∞-algebras over an (∞,1)-operad]].

This includes notably [[Vogt's theorem]] on the rectification of [[homotopy coherent diagrams]].
