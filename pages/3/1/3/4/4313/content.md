Matrix factorizations were introduced by David Eisenbud, and they were originally studied in the context of [[commutative algebra]].

Matrix factorizations arise in [[string theory]] as categories of [[D-branes]] for [[Landau-Ginzburg model|Landau-Ginzburg]] [[B-model]]s. This was proposed by Kontsevich and elaborated in the paper of Kapustin-Li.

Matrix factorizations have also been used by Khovanov-Rozansky in knot theory http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0401268

Matrix factorization categories are examples of [[Calabi-Yau categories]], hence correspond to [[TCFT]]s by the Costello/Kontsevich/Hopkins-Lurie theorem. The Calabi-Yau structure is elucidated in recent work of Dyckerhoff-Murfet and Polishchuk-Vaintrob.

Dyckerhoff has proved that the [[Hochschild homology]] of the matrix factorizations category of an isolated singularity is the [[Jacobian ring]] of the singularity. See also the work of E. Segal and Caldararu-Tu. In light of the Costello/Kontsevich/Hopkins-Lurie theorem, this result has been anticipated for some time, as the closed state space of a Landau-Ginzburg B-model is the Jacobian ring.

There is also the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence. In some cases, categories of matrix factorizations turn out to be equivalent to categories of coherent sheaves.

For general theory and properties of matrix factorizations, see work of Orlov. For example, matrix factorization categories are related to derived categories of singularities.
