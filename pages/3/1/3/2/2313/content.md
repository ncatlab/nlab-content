## Idea

A _Bott element_ is an element in a [[periodic cohomology theory]], multiplication by which is [[invertible element|invertible]].

Specifically for complex [[topological K-theory]] there is the element of $1 - L \,\in\, K\big( \mathbb{C}P^1 \big)$ degree 2 (the [[virtual vector bundle|virtual difference]] of the [[trivial line bundle]] with the [[tautological line bundle]] on the [[Riemann sphere]]/[[complex projective space|complex projective 1-space]]) which induces [[Bott periodicity]]. This is where the term "Bott element" comes from. For details on this case see at

* _[[equivariant K-theory of projective G-space]]_.
