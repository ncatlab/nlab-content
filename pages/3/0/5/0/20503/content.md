## Idea

The _collar neighbourhood theorem_ due to [Brown 62](#Brown62), hence also known as _Brown's collaring theorem_, says that the [[boundary]] of any [[manifold with boundary]] always admits a "collar", namely an [[open neighbourhood]] which is the [[Cartesian product]] of the boundary with a [[half-open interval]].

This theorem is central notably for the definition and behaviour of [[categories of cobordisms]].

## Statement

Let $X$ be a [[topological manifold]] or [[smooth manifold]] [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]] $\partial X$. Then the [[boundary]] [[topological subspace|subspace]] inclusion has an [[open neighbourhood]] which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] or [[diffeomorphic]], respectively, to a [[collar]], i.e. to the [[product space|Cartesian product]] manifold with boundary $\partial X \times [0,1)$ of $\partial X$ with the [[half-open interval]]:

$$
  \partial X
  \overset{
     (id, 0)
  }{\hookrightarrow}
  (\partial X) \times [0,1)
  \overset{et}{\hookrightarrow}
  X
  \,.
$$
