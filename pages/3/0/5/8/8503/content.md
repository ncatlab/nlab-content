# Paradoxes

## Idea

A _paradox_ is an example of reasoning that seems perfectly valid on first sight, but which results in a [[contradiction]] or [[inconsistency]]. For example:

> The following statement is false.

> The previous statement is true.

Either sentence alone seems perfectly reasonable, and could meaningfully be said in another context; but together they form a paradox.  It is not just that the sentences contradict each other (in which case one or both might simply be false); but the *existence* of the sentences contradicts the assumption that they are meaningful at all (at least using [[classical logic]]).


Mathematical paradoxes of this form (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) are resolved by requiring stronger well-formedness rules to admissible sentences, for instance by requiring strict [[type theory|typing]] and/or [[guarded recursion]] which prevents infinite self-reference.

In contrast, paradoxes in [[physics]] may not necessarily be logical inconsistencies and tend to be resolved by rejecting unjustified assumptions and adopting more accurate laws of nature. For instance *[[Zeno's paradox of motion]]* is resolved by recognizing the notion of [[limit of a sequence]]; and the *[[hole paradox]]* is (or was) effectively a misunderstanding of the rules of [[differential geometry]] applied to [[spacetime]].
