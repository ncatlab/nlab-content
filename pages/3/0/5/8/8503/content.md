# Paradoxes

## Idea

A _paradox_ is an example of reasoning that seems perfectly valid on first sight, but which results in a [[contradiction]] or [[inconsistency]]. For example:

> The following statement is false.

> The previous statement is true.

Either sentence alone seems perfectly reasonable, and could meaningfully be said in another context; but together they form a paradox.  It is not just that the sentences contradict each other (in which case one or both might simply be false); but the *existence* of the sentences contradicts the assumption that they are meaningful at all (at least using [[classical logic]]).

## Examples

### From logic and foundations

* [[Russell's paradox]]

* [[Curry's paradox]]

* [[Burali-Forti's paradox]]

* [[Cantor's paradox]]

* [[Banach-Tarski paradox]]

### From natural science

In [[physics]]:

* [[Zeno's paradox of motion]]

* [[hole paradox]]

* [[Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox]]

* [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]

* [[black hole information paradox]]


[[!redirects paradox]]
[[!redirects paradoxes]]
