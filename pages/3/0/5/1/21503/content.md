## Idea

A [[model category]]-[[mathematical structure|structure]] on the [[category]] of [[diffeological spaces]].


## References

A proof of a model structure on diffeological spaces, with weak equivalences detected on standard smooth homotopy groups, is claimed in 

* {#HaraguchiShimakawa13} [[Tadayuki Haraguchi]], [[Kazuhisa Shimakawa]], _A model structure on the category of diffeological spaces_ ([arXiv:1311.5668](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5668))

though [Kihara 16](#Kihara16) writes ([p. 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06794.pdf#page=2)) that 

> there exists a gap in the proof of [Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13](#HaraguchiShimakawa13), Theorem 5.6

Apparently this gap is meant to be addressed in

* {#Haraguchi18} [[Tadayuki Haraguchi]], _Homotopy structures of smooth CW complexes_ ([arXiv:1811.06175](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06175))

which however seems also to remain unpublished.

A different model structure, however not using the standard smooth homotopy groups(!), is claimed (and published) in 

* {#Kihara16} [[Hiroshi Kihara]], _Model category of diffeological spaces_, Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures, (2018), 1-40 ([arXiv:1605.06794](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06794))
