## Idea ##
The notion of a causal [[net]] of algebras is a generalization of [[local nets]] of the [[Haag-Kastler approach]] to [[quantum field theory]], see for example [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]]. 


## Definition ##
A [[net]] of [[algebras]] (A_i) is a **causal net** if the index set $I$ is a [[causal index set]] and for $i, j \in I, i \perp \j$ implies that $A_i$ and $A_j$ commute elementwise. 

The net is said to satisfy the **causality condition** in this case.
