## Idea ##
In a (Hausdorff) [[topological vector space]] one can consider [[bounded subspace|bounded sets]]: a set $S$ is bounded if it is absorbed by any open neighborhood $U$ of zero (i.e. a dilated multiple $\lambda U = \{\lambda x | x\in U\}$ contains $S$). This specializes to the usual definition of a bounded set in a [[normed vector space]]: a set is bounded if it is contained in a ball of some finite radius $r\gt 0$. 

A [[linear operator]] $A: V_1\to V_2$ between topological vector spaces is **bounded** if it sends each bounded set in $V_1$ to a bounded set in $V_2$. For [[normed vector space|normed spaces]], this is equivalent to saying that it sends the unit ball to a bounded set. Between finite dimensional normed spaces, every linear operator is bounded. A linear operator between any two normed linear spaces is bounded iff it is [[continuous map|continuous]]. 

There is also a rich theory for [[unbounded operators]] on [[Hilbert spaces]].

## Properties 

Every bounded operator on a [[Hilbert space]] has a [[polar decomposition]].

Important classes of bounded operators are the [[compact operators]], [[trace class operators]] and [[Hilbert-Schmidt operators]].
