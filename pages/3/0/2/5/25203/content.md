## Idea

A square-free number is a [[natural number]] $n$ such that for all [[prime numbers]] $p$, $p^2$ does not divide $n$. 

## Properties

Given a square-free number $n$ with prime factors 
$$n = \prod p_i$$
the [[completion of a ring|completion]] of the [[sequence]] of finite cyclic rings $\mathbb{Z}/n^i\mathbb{Z}$ is the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$, which is a subring of the [[profinite integers]] and the [[product]] of the [[p-adic integers]] of the prime factors of $n$:
$$\mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq \prod \mathbb{Z}_{p_i}$$

Given a square-free integer $n$, the [[integers modulo n]] $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[reduced ring]]. Since for every integer $n$ the  $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[prefield ring]], $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is an [[integral domain]] and thus a [[field]] if and only if $n$ is a [[prime number]]. 

Given any odd prime number $p$, the integer $2 p$ is square-free, and the ring $\mathbb{Z}/2 p\mathbb{Z}$ has [[idempotent elements]] of $0$, $1$, $p$, and $p + 1$. Every element of $\mathbb{Z}/2 p\mathbb{Z}$ could be written as a [[linear combination]] of $p$ and $p + 1$.
