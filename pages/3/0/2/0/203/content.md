A [[functor]] $F: C \to D$ from the category $C$ to the category $D$ is _faithful_ if for each pair of objects $x, y \in C$, the function

$$F : hom(x,y) \to hom(F(x), F(y))$$

is one-to-one.  

More abstractly, we may say a functor is faithful if it is [[k-surjectivity|2-surjective]] - or loosely speaking, 'surjective on equations between morphisms'.
