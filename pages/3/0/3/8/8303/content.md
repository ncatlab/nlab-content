## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]] its _commutator subgroup_ $[G,G] \hookrightarrow G$ is the smallest [[subgroup]] containing all the [[group commutator]]
elements $[g,h] \coloneqq g^{-1} h^{-1} g h$.

This definition also makes sense for [[invertible semigroups]], for which they would be called 'commutator invertible subsemigroups'. 

## Properties

* The commutator subgroup is a [[normal subgroup]]. Therefore the [[quotient group]] $G^{ab} \coloneqq G/[G,G]$ exists. This is an [[abelian group]], called the [[abelianization]] of $G$.
