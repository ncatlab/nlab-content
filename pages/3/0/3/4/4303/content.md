## Idea

In the [[path integral]] [[quantization]] of [[quantum field theory]], the partial [[path integral]] of an [[action functional]] over just the [[fermionic field]]s yields in general not a function on the remaining space of bosonic fields, but a section of a [[line bundle]] on this bosonic configuration space. This is the _Pfaffian line bundle_
of the family of [[Dirac operator]]s that enters the kinetic term of the [[fermionic field]]s in the [[action functional]]. It is a [[determinant line bundle]].

If this line bundle is non-trivial, one says its class is the fermionic [[quantum anomaly]] of the would-be QFT.
