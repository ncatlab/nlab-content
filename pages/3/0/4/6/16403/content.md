  {#BasicNotionsOfHomotopyTheory}

Traditionally, [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] have been [[foundations|founded]] on [[set theory]], whose concept of _[[sets]]_ is that of "bags of distinguishable points". 

But fundamental [[physics]] is governed by the _[[gauge principle]]_. This says that given any two "things", such as two [[field history|field histories]] $x$ and $y$, it is in general wrong to ask whether they are [[equality|equal]] or not, instead one has to ask where there is a _[[gauge transformation]]_ 

$$
  x \stackrel{\gamma}{\longrightarrow} y
$$

between them. In mathematics this is called a _[[homotopy]]_.

This principle applies also to [[gauge transformations]]/[[homotopies]] themselves, and thus leads to _[[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]_ or _[[homotopies of homotopies]]_

<center><img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/2Cell.jpg" width = "200"></center>

and so on to ever _[[higher gauge transformations]]_ or _[[higher homotopies]]_:

<center>
  <img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/3Cell.jpg" width = "200">
</center>

This shows that what $x$ an $y$ here are [[elements]] of is not really a [[set]] in the sense of [[set theory]]. Instead, such a collection of [[elements]] with [[higher gauge transformations]]/[[higher homotopies]] between them is called a _[[homotopy type]]_.

Hence the theory of [[homotopy types]] --  _[[homotopy theory]]_ -- is much like [[set theory]], but with the concept of [[gauge transformation]]/[[homotopy]] built right into its [[foundations]]. Homotopy theory is gauged mathematics.


A [[classical model structure on topological spaces|classical model]] for [[homotopy types]] are simply [[topological spaces]]: Their points represent the elements, the [[continuous map|continuous]] [[paths]] between points represent the [[gauge transformations]], and continuous deformations of paths represent [[higher gauge transformations]]. A central result of [[homotopy theory]] is the [[proof]] of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_, which says that under this identification [[homotopy types]] are [[Quillen equivalence|equivalent]] to [[topological spaces]] viewed, in turn, up to "[[weak homotopy equivalence]]".

In the special case of a [[homotopy type]] with a single [[element]] $x$, the [[gauge transformations]] necessarily go from $x$ to itself and hence form a _[[group]] of [[symmetries]]_ of $x$. 

<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GroupActing.jpg" width="80">
</center>

This way [[homotopy theory]] subsumes [[group theory]].

If there are higher order [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]/[[homotopies of homotopies]] between these [[symmetry]] [[group]]-elements, then one speaks of _[[2-groups]]_, _[[3-groups]]_, ... _[[n-groups]]_, and eventually of _[[∞-groups]]_. When [[homotopy types]] are represented by [[topological spaces]], then [[∞-groups]] are represented by [[topological groups]].

This way [[homotopy theory]] subsumes parts of [[topological group|topological]] [[group theory]].

Since, generally, there is more than one element in a [[homotopy type]], these are like "groups with several elements", and as such they are called _[[groupoids]]_ (Def. \ref{Groupoid}). 

If there are higher order [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]/[[homotopies of homotopies]] between the transformations in such a [[groupoid]], one speaks of _[[2-groupoids]]_, _[[3-groupoids]]_, ... _[[n-groupoids]]_, and eventually of _[[∞-groupoids]]_. The plain [[sets]] are recovered as the special case of [[0-groupoids]].

Due to the higher orders $n$ appearing here, [[mathematical structures]] based not on [[sets]] but on [[homotopy types]] are also called _[[schreiber:Higher Structures|higher structures]]_.

Hence [[homotopy types]] are equivalently _[[∞-groupoids]]_. This perspective makes explicit that [[homotopy types]] are the unification of plain [[sets]] with the concept of [[gauge transformation|gauge]]-[[symmetry]] [[groups]].

An efficient way of handling [[∞-groupoids]] is in their explicit guise as _[[Kan complexes]]_ (Def. \ref{KanComplexe} below); these are the non-abelian generalization of the _[[chain complexes]]_ used in [[homological algebra]]. Indeed, _[[chain homotopy]]_ is a special case of the general concept of [[homotopy]], and hence [[homological algebra]] forms but a special abelian corner within [[homotopy theory]]. Conversely, [[homotopy theory]] may be understood as the non-abelian generalization of [[homological algebra]].

Hence, in a self-reflective manner, there are many different but _[[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]]_ incarnations of [[homotopy theory]]. Below we discuss in turn:


* _[Topological homotopy theory](#TopologicalHomotopyTheory)_

  [[∞-groupoids]] modeled by [[topological spaces]]. This is the [[classical model structure on topological spaces|classical model]] of [[homotopy theory]] familiar from traditional [[point-set topology]], such as [[covering space]]-theory.

* _[Simplicial homotopy theory](#SimplicialHomotopyTheory)_.

  [[∞-groupoids]] modeled on [[simplicial sets]], whose [[fibrant objects]] are the [[Kan complexes]]. This [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to [[topological homotopy theory]] (the "[[homotopy hypothesis]]"), which makes explicit that [[homotopy theory]] is not really about [[topological spaces]], but about the [[∞-groupoids]] that these represent.

$\,$

Ideally, abstract homotopy theory would simply be a complete replacement of [[set theory]], obtained by _removing_ the assumption of strict [[equality]], relaxing it to [[gauge equivalence]]/[[homotopy]]. As such, abstract homotopy theory would be part and parcel of the [[foundations of mathematics]] themselves, not requiring any further discussion. This ideal perspective is the promise of _[[homotopy type theory]]_ and may become full practical reality in the next decades.

Until then, abstract homotopy theory has to be formulated on top of the traditional [[foundations of mathematics]] provided by [[set theory]], much like one may have to run a Linux emulator on a Windows machine, if one does happen to be stuck with the latter.

A very convenient and powerful such emulator for homotopy theory within set theory is _[[model categories|model category theory]]_, originally due to [Quillen 67](model+category#Quillen67) and highly developed since. This we introduce here. 

The idea is to consider ordinary [[categories]] (Def. \ref{Categories}) but with the understanding that some of their [[morphisms]] 

$$
  X 
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
$$

should be _[[homotopy equivalences]]_ (Def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}), namely similar to [[isomorphisms]] (Def. \ref{Isomorphism}), but not necessarily satisfying the two [[equations]] defining an actual isomorphism 

$$
  f^{-1} \circ f \;=\; id_{X}
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f \circ f^{-1} \;=\; id_Y
$$ 

but intended to satisfy this only with [[equality]] relaxed to [[gauge transformation]]/[[homotopy]]:

\[
  \label{HomotopyEquivalenceCondition}
  f^{-1} \circ f \;\overset{gauge}{\Rightarrow}\; id_{X}
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f \circ f^{-1} \;\overset{gauge}{\Rightarrow}\; id_Y
  \,.
\] 

Such _would-be homotopy equivalences_ are called _[[weak equivalences]]_ (Def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences} below). 

In principle, this information already defines a [[homotopy theory]] by a construction called _[[simplicial localization]]_, which turns [[weak equivalences]] into actual [[homotopy equivalences]] in a suitable way. 

However, without further tools this construction is unwieldy. The extra structure of a _[[model category]]_ (Def. \ref{ModelCategory} below) on top of a [[category with weak equivalences]] provides a set of tools.

The idea here is to abstract (in Def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory} below) from the evident concepts in [[topological homotopy theory]] of _[[left homotopy]]_ (Def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}) and _[[right homotopy]]_ (Def. \ref{RightHomotopy}) between [[continuous functions]]: These are provided by continuous functions out of a [[cylinder|cylinder space]] $Cyl(X)  = X \times [0,1]$ or into a [[path space]] $Path(X) = X^{[0,1]}$, respectively, where in both cases the [[interval|interval space]] $[0,1]$ serves to parameterize the relevant [[gauge transformation]]/[[homotopy]].

Now a little reflection shows (this was the seminal insight of [Quillen 67](model+category#Quillen67)) that what really matters in this construction of homotopies is that the [[path space]] factors the [[diagonal morphism]] from a space $X$ to its [[Cartesian product]] as

$$
  diag_X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X 
    \underoverset{\text{weak equiv.}}{\text{ cofibration }}{\longrightarrow}
  Path(X)
     \overset{\text{ fibration }}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times X  
$$

while the cylinder serves to factor the [[codiagonal morphism]] as 

$$
  codiag_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
    \overset{ \text{cofibration} }{\longrightarrow}
  Cyl(X)
    \underoverset{ \text{weak equiv} }{ \text{fibration} }{\longrightarrow}
  X
$$

where in both cases "[[fibration]]" means something like _well behaved [[surjection]]_, while "[[cofibration]]" means something like _satisfying the [[lifting property]] (Def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension} below) against fibrations that are also weak equivalences_.

Such factorizations subject to lifting properties is what the definition of _[[model category]]_ axiomatizes, in some generality. That this indeed provides a good toolbox for handling [[homotopy equivalences]] is shown by the _[[Whitehead theorem]] in [[model categories]]_ (Lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories} below), which exhibits all [[weak equivalences]] as actual [[homotopy equivalences]] after passage to "good representatives" of objects (fibrant/cofibrant [[resolutions]], Def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} below). Accordingly, the first theorem of model category theory ([Quillen 67, I.1 theorem 1](model+category#Quillen67), reproduced as Theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} below), provides a tractable expression for the [[hom-sets]] modulo [[homotopy equivalence]] of the underlying [[category with weak equivalences]] in terms of actual morphisms out of [[cofibrant resolutions]] into [[fibrant resolutions]] (Lemma \ref{HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory} below).

This is then generally how [[model category]]-theory serves as a model for [[homotopy theory]]: All homotopy-theoretic constructions, such as that of [[long homotopy fiber sequences]] (Prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence} below), are reflected via constructions of ordinary [[category theory]] but applied to suitably [[resolution|resolved objects]].

###### Definition
**([[model category]])**

A **[[model category]]** is

1. a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (Def. \ref{Categories}) with all [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (Def. \ref{Limits});

1. three sub-[[classes]] $W, Fib, Cof \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its class of [[morphisms]];

such that

1. the class $W$ makes $\mathcal{C}$ into a **[[category with weak equivalences]]**, def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences};

1. The pairs $(W \cap Cof\;,\; Fib)$ and $(Cap\;,\; W\cap Fib)$ are both [[weak factorization systems]], def. \ref{WeakFactorizationSystem}.

One says:

* elements in $W$ are _[[weak equivalences]]_,

* elements in $Cof$ are _[[cofibrations]]_,

* elements in $Fib$ are _[[fibrations]]_,

* elements in $W\cap Cof$ are _[[acyclic cofibrations]]_,

* elements in $W \cap Fib$ are _[[acyclic fibrations]]_.

The form of def. \ref{ModelCategory} is due to ([Joyal, def. E.1.2](model+category#Joyal)). It implies various other conditions that ([Quillen 67](model+category#Quillen67)) demands explicitly, see prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms} and prop. \ref{WeakEquivalencesAreClosedUnderRetracts} below.

We now dicuss the concept of [[weak factorization systems]] (Def. \ref{WeakFactorizationSystem} below) appearing in def. \ref{ModelCategory}.

**([[lift]] and [[extension]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any [[category]].
Given a [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow
     \\
     B

$$

then an *[[extension]]* of the [[morphism]] $f$ along the [[morphism]] $p$ is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{

Combining these cases: given a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2

$$

then a **[[lifting]]** in the diagram is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2

$$

Given a sub-[[class]] of morphisms $K \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$, then

* a morphism $p_r$ as above is said to have the **[[right lifting property]] against $K$** or to be a **$K$-[[injective morphism]]** if in all square diagrams with $p_r$ on the right and any $p_l \in K$ on the left a lift exists.

dually:

* a morphism $p_l$ is said to have the **[[left lifting property]] against $K$** or to be a **$K$-[[projective morphism]]**  if in all square diagrams with $p_l$ on the left and any $p_r \in K$ on the left a lift exists.

**([[weak factorization systems]])**

A **[[weak factorization system]]** (WFS) on a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[pair]] $(Proj,Inj)$ of [[classes]] of [[morphisms]] of $\mathcal{C}$ such that

1. Every [[morphism]] $f \colon X\to Y$ of $\mathcal{C}$ may be factored as the [[composition]] of a morphism in $Proj$ followed by one in $Inj$

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[category]], a **[[functorial factorization]]** of the morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[functor]]

$$

###### Remark

In def. \ref{FunctorialFactorization} we are using the following standard notation, see at _[[simplex category]]_ and at _[[nerve of a category]]_:

Write $[1] = \{0 \to 1\}$ and $[2] = \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}$ for the [[ordinal numbers]], regarded as [[posets]] and hence as [[categories]]. The [[arrow category]] $Arr(\mathcal{C})$ is equivalently the [[functor category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]} \coloneqq Funct(\Delta[1], \mathcal{C})$, while $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[2]}\coloneqq Funct(\Delta[2], \mathcal{C})$ has as objects pairs of composable morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. There are three injective functors $\delta_i \colon [1] \rightarrow [2]$, where $\delta_i$ omits the index $i$ in its image.
By precomposition, this induces [[functors]] $d_i  \colon \mathcal{C}^{\Delta[2]} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$. Here

* $d_1$ sends a pair of composable morphisms to their [[composition]];

* $d_2$ sends a pair of composable morphisms to the first morphisms;

* $d_0$ sends a pair of composable morphisms to the second morphisms.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] and let $K\subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ be a [[class]] of [[morphisms]]. Write $K Proj$ and $K Inj$, respectively, for the sub-classes of $K$-[[projective morphisms]] and of $K$-[[injective morphisms]], def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension}. Then:

1. Both classes are closed under [[composition]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

   $K Proj$ is also closed under [[transfinite composition]].

1. Both classes are closed under forming [[retracts]] in the [[arrow category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ (see remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}).

1. $K Proj$ is closed under forming [[pushouts]] of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ ("[[cobase change]]").

###### Proof

We go through each item in turn.

**containing isomorphisms**

Given a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{f}{\rightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}_{\mathllap{\in Iso}}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

with the left morphism an isomorphism, then a [[lift]] is given by using the [[inverse]] of this isomorphism ${}^{{f \circ i^{-1}}}\nearrow$. Hence in particular there is a lift when $p \in K$ and so $i \in K Proj$. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

**closure under composition**

Given a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

consider its [[pasting]] decomposition as

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow
    &\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the bottom commuting square has a lift, by assumption. This yields another [[pasting]] decomposition

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

and now the top commuting square has a lift by assumption. This is now equivalently a lift in the total diagram, showing that $p_1\circ p_1$ has the right lifting property against $K$ and is hence in $K Inj$. The case of composing two morphisms in $K Proj$  is [[formal dual|formally dual]]. From this the closure of $K Proj$ under [[transfinite composition]] follows since the latter is given by [[colimits]] of sequential composition and successive lifts against the underlying sequence as above constitutes a [[cocone]], whence the extension of the lift to the colimit follows by its [[universal property]].

**closure under retracts**

Let $j$ be the [[retract]] of an $i \in K Proj$, i.e. let there be a [[commuting diagram]] of the form.

$$
  \array{
    id_A \colon & A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Proj}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
    \\
    id_B \colon & B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Then for

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{j}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
     \\
     B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

a [[commuting square]], it is equivalent to its [[pasting]] composite with that retract diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Proj}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B &\longrightarrow & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the pasting composite of the two squares on the right has a lift, by assumption:

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{}
      &&
    \nearrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B &\longrightarrow & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By composition, this is also a lift in the total outer rectangle, hence in the original square. Hence $j$ has the left lifting property against all $p \in K$ and hence is in $K Proj$. The other case is [[formal duality|formally dual]].



**closure under pushout and pullback**

Let $p \in K Inj$ and and let

$$
  \array{
    Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{{f^* p}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} & Y
  }
$$

be a [[pullback]] diagram in $\mathcal{C}$. We need to show that $f^* p$ has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all $i \in K$. So let

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& Z \times_f X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathrlap{f^* p}}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z
  }
$$

be a [[commuting square]]. We need to construct a diagonal lift of that square. To that end, first consider the [[pasting]] composite with the pullback square from above to obtain the commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the right lifting property of $p$, there is a diagonal lift of the total outer diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} &{}^{\hat {(f g)}}\nearrow&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{f g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]] this gives rise to the lift $\hat g$ in

$$
  \array{
     && Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     &{}^{\hat g} \nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

In order for $\hat g$ to qualify as the intended lift of the total diagram, it remains to show that

$$
  \array{

$$

commutes. To do so we notice that we obtain two [[cones]] with tip $A$:

* one is given by the morphisms
  1. $A \to Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$

  with universal morphism into the pullback being

  * $A \to Z \times_f X$

* the other by
  1. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$.

  with universal morphism into the pullback being

  * $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X$.

The commutativity of the diagrams that we have established so far shows that the first and second morphisms here equal each other, respectively. By the fact that the universal morphism into a pullback diagram is _unique_ this implies the required identity of morphisms.

The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

**closure under (co-)products**

Let $\{(A_s \overset{i_s}{\to} B_s) \in K Proj\}_{s \in S}$ be a set of elements of $K Proj$. Since [[colimits]] in the [[presheaf category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ are computed componentwise, their [[coproduct]] in this [[arrow category]] is the universal morphism out of the coproduct of objects $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod} A_s$ induced via its [[universal property]] by the set of morphisms $i_s$:

$$
  \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s
  \overset{(i_s)_{s\in S}}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s
  \,.
$$

Now let

$$
  \array{
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_s)_{s\in S}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

be a [[commuting square]]. This is in particular a [[cocone]] under the [[coproduct]] of objects, hence by the [[universal property]] of the coproduct, this is equivalent to a set of commuting diagrams

$$
  \left\{
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_s}}_{\mathllap{\in K Proj}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \right\}_{s\in S}
  \,.
$$

By assumption, each of these has a lift $\ell_s$. The collection of these lifts

$$
  \left\{
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_s}}_{\mathllap{\in Proj}}\downarrow
      &{}^{\ell_s}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \right\}_{s\in S}
$$

is now itself a compatible [[cocone]], and so once more by the [[universal property]] of the coproduct, this is equivalent to a lift $(\ell_s)_{s\in S}$ in the original square

$$
  \array{
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_s)_{s\in S}}}\downarrow
     &{}^{(\ell_s)_{s\in S}}\nearrow&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that the coproduct of the $i_s$ has the left lifting property against all $f\in K$ and is hence in $K Proj$. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

$$

be a [[commuting diagram]] in the given model category, with $w \in W$ a weak equivalence. We need to show that then also $f \in W$.

First consider the case that $f \in Fib$.

In this case, factor $w$ as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. Since $w \in W$ and by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) this is even a factorization through an acyclic cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. Hence we obtain a commuting diagram of the following form:

$$
  \array{
    id \colon
    &
    A
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
      &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\longrightarrow}& A

    \downarrow

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    id \colon & B &\longrightarrow& Y &\underset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where $s$ is uniquely defined and where $t$ is any lift of the top middle vertical acyclic cofibration against $f$. This now exhibits $f$ as a retract of an acyclic fibration. These are closed under retract by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}.

Now consider the general case. Factor $f$ as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration and form the [[pushout]] in the top left square of the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    id \colon
    &
    A
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
      &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    &
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow
      &(po)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Cof}}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Cof}}
    \\
    id \colon
    & A' &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
     X'
     &\overset{\phantom{AA}\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& A'
    \\
    &
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Fib}}
    \downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W }}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    id \colon & B &\longrightarrow& Y &\underset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the other three squares are induced by the [[universal property]] of the pushout, as is the identification of the middle horizontal composite as the identity on $A'$. Since acyclic cofibrations are closed under forming pushouts by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, the top middle vertical morphism is now an acyclic fibration, and hence by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] so is the middle bottom vertical morphism.

Thus the previous case now gives that the bottom left vertical morphism is a weak equivalence, and hence the total left vertical composite is.

$$

1. If $f$ has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $i$.

1. If $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $i$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $p$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the first statement, the second is [[formal duality|formally dual]].

Write the factorization of $f$ as a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the assumed [[lifting property]] of $f$ against $p$ there exists a diagonal filler $g$ making a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By rearranging this diagram a little, it is equivalent to

$$
  \array{
    & X &=& X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
     &&

    id_Y \colon & Y &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& A &\underset{p}{\longrightarrow}&

Completing this to the right, this yields a diagram exhibiting the required retract according to remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}:

    \\

**Small object argument**

Given a set $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, a natural question is how to factor any given morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ through a relative $C$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-[[injective morphism]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f
    \;\colon\;
  X
    \stackrel{\in C cell}{\longrightarrow}
  \hat X
    \stackrel{\in C inj}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,.
$$

A first approximation to such a factorization turns out to be given simply by forming $\hat X = X_1$ by attaching **all** possible $C$-cells to $X$. Namely let

$$
  (C/f)
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
       dom(c) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{c\in C}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       cod(c) &\longrightarrow& Y
    }
  \right\}
$$

be the [[set]] of **all** ways to find a $C$-cell attachment in $f$, and consider the [[pushout]] $\hat X$ of the [[coproduct]] of morphisms in $C$ over all these:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &(po)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This gets already close to producing the intended factorization:

First of all the resulting map $X \to X_1$ is a $C$-relative cell complex, by construction.

Second, by the fact that the coproduct is over all commuting squres to $f$, the morphism $f$ itself makes a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

and hence the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] means that $f$ is indeed factored through that $C$-cell complex $X_1$; we may suggestively arrange that factorizing diagram like so:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
     &&
    X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that, finally, the colimiting [[co-cone]] map -- the one that now appears diagonally -- **almost** exhibits the desired right lifting of $X_1 \to Y$ against the $c\in C$. The failure of that to hold on the nose is only the fact that a horizontal map in the middle of the above diagram is missing: the diagonal map obtained above lifts not all commuting diagrams of $c\in C$ into $f$, but only those where the top morphism $dom(c) \to X_1$ factors through $X \to X_1$.

The idea of the [[small object argument]] now is to fix this only remaining problem by iterating the construction: next factor $X_1 \to Y$ in the same way into

$$
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_2 \longrightarrow Y
$$

and so forth. Since relative $C$-cell complexes are closed under composition, at stage $n$ the resulting $X \longrightarrow X_n$ is still a $C$-cell complex, getting bigger and bigger. But accordingly, the failure of the accompanying $X_n \longrightarrow Y$ to be a $C$-[[injective morphism]] becomes smaller and smaller, for it now lifts against all diagrams where $dom(c) \longrightarrow X_n$ factors through $X_{n-1}\longrightarrow X_n$, which intuitively is less and less of a condition as the $X_{n-1}$ grow larger and larger.

The concept of _[[small object]]_ is just what makes this intuition precise and finishes the small object argument. For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:

$$

every morphism  $dom(c)\longrightarrow \hat X$ factors through a stage $X_\beta \to \hat X$ of order $\beta \lt \alpha$:

###### Remark

For every object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ in a model category, a cylinder object and a path space object according to def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} exist: the factorization axioms guarantee that there exists

1. a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] as

The cylinder and path space objects obtained this way are actually better than required by def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}: in addition to $Cyl(X)\to X$ being just a weak equivalence, for these this is actually an acyclic fibration, and dually in addition to $X\to Path(X)$ being a weak equivalence, for these it is actually an acyclic cofibrations.

Some authors call cylinder/path-space objects with this extra property "very good" cylinder/path-space objects, respectively.

One may also consider dropping a condition in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}: what mainly matters is the weak equivalence, hence some authors take cylinder/path-space objects to be defined as in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} but without the condition that $X \sqcup X\to Cyl(X)$ is a cofibration and without the condition that $Path(X) \to X$ is a fibration. Such authors would then refer to the concept in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} as "good" cylinder/path-space objects.

The terminology in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} follows the original ([Quillen 67, I.1 def. 4](model+category#Quillen67)). With the induced concept of left/right homotopy below in def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory}, this admits a quick derivation of the key facts in the following, as we spell out below.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. If $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is cofibrant, then for every [[cylinder object]] $Cyl(X)$ of $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, not only is $(i_0,i_1) \colon X \sqcup X \to X$ a cofibration, but each

$$
  i_0, i_1 \colon X \longrightarrow Cyl(X)
$$

is an acyclic cofibration separately.

Dually, if $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is fibrant, then for every [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ of $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, not only is $(p_0,p_1) \colon Path(X)\to X \times X$ a cofibration, but each

$$
  p_0, p_1 \colon Path(X) \longrightarrow X
$$

is an acyclic fibration separately.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the case of the path space object. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

First, that the component maps are weak equivalences follows generally: by definition they have a [[right inverse]] $Path(X) \to X$ and so this follows by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

But if $X$ is fibrant, then also the two projection maps out of the product $X \times X \to X$ are fibrations, because they are both pullbacks of the fibration $X \to \ast$

$$
  \array{
      X\times X &\longrightarrow& X
      \\
      \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
      \\
      X &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

hence $p_i \colon Path(X)\to X \times X \to X$ is the composite of two fibrations, and hence itself a fibration, by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}.

If $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is a fibrant object in a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}, and for $Path_1(X)$ and $Path_2(X)$ two [[path space objects]] for $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, then the [[fiber product]] $Path_1(X) \times_X Path_2(X)$ is another path space object for $X$: the pullback square

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}&  X \times X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     Path_1(X) \underset{X}{\times} Path_2(X)
     &\longrightarrow&
     Path_1(X)\times Path_2(X)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\downarrow
     &(pb)&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
     \\
     X \times X \times X
     &\overset{(id,\Delta_X,id)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X\times X \times X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(pr_1,pr_3)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_1, p_4)}}
     \\
     X\times X &=& X \times X
  }
$$

gives that the induced projection is again a fibration. Moreover, using lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} and [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) gives that $X \to Path_1(X) \times_X Path_2(X)$ is a weak equivalence.

For the case of the canonical topological path space objects of def \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}, with $Path_1(X) = Path_2(X) = X^I = X^{[0,1]}$  then this new path space object is $X^{I \vee I} = X^{[0,2]}$, the [[mapping space]] out of the standard interval of length 2 instead of length 1.

Let $f,g \colon X \to Y$ be two [[parallel morphisms]] in a [[model category]].

1. Let $X$ be cofibrant. If there is a [[left homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_L g$ then there is also a [[right homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_R g$ (def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory}) with respect to any chosen path space object.

1. Let $X$ be fibrant. If there is a [[right homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_R g$ then there is also a [[left homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_L g$ with respect to any chosen cylinder object.

In particular if $X$ is cofibrant and $Y$ is fibrant, then by going back and forth it follows that every left homotopy is exhibited by every cylinder object, and every right homotopy is exhibited by every path space object.

###### Proof

We discuss the first case, the second is [[formal dual|formally dual]].
Let $\eta \colon Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y$ be the given left homotopy. Lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} implies that we have a lift $h$ in the following [[commuting diagram]]

$$

For $X$ a cofibrant object in a [[model category]] and $Y$ a [[fibrant object]], then the [[relations]] of [[left homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_L g$ and of [[right homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow_R g$ (def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory}) on the [[hom set]] $Hom(X,Y)$ coincide and are both [[equivalence relations]].

That both relations coincide under the (co-)fibrancy assumption follows directly from lemma \ref{LeftHomotopyWithCofibrantDomainImpliesRightHomotopyAndDually}.

The [[symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of the relation is obvious.

###### Definition
**([[homotopy category of a model category]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. Write $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both [[fibrant object|fibrant]] and [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]];

* [[morphisms]] are the [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, hence the [[equivalence classes]] of morphism under the equivalence relation of prop. \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations};

and whose [[composition]] operation is given on representatives by composition in $\mathcal{C}$.

This is, up to [[equivalence of categories]], the **[[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category of the model category]]** $\mathcal{C}$.

###### Proposition

Def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} is well defined, in that composition of morphisms between fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ indeed passes to [[homotopy classes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Fix any morphism $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ between fibrant-cofibrant objects. Then for precomposition

$$
 (-) \circ [f] \;\colon\; Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(Y,Z) \to Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C}(X,Z))}
$$

to be well defined, we need that with $(g\sim h)\;\colon\; Y \to Z$ also $(f g \sim f h)\;\colon\; X \to Z$. But by prop \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations} we may take the homotopy $\sim$ to be exhibited by a right homotopy $\eta \colon Y \to Path(Z)$, for which case the statement is evident from this diagram:

$$
  \array{
    && && Z
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{g}}\nearrow & \uparrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}
    \\
    X

    Y

    Path(Z)
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{h}}\searrow & \downarrow_{\mathrlap{p_0}}
    \\
    && && Z
  }
  \,.
$$

For postcomposition we may choose to exhibit homotopy by left homotopy and argue [[formal dual|dually]].

We now spell out that def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} indeed satisfies the [[universal property]] that defines the [[localization]] of a [[category with weak equivalences]] at its weak equivalences.

+-- {: .num_lemma #WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}
###### Lemma
**([[Whitehead theorem]] in [[model categories]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. A [[weak equivalence]] between two objects which are both [[fibrant object|fibrant]] and [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]] (eq:HomotopyEquivalenceCondition).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the factorization axioms in the model category $\mathcal{C}$ and by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}), every weak equivalence $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ factors through an object $Z$ as an acyclic cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. In particular it follows that with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant, so is $Z$, and hence it is sufficient to prove that acyclic (co-)fibrations between such objects are homotopy equivalences.

So let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be an acyclic fibration between fibrant-cofibrant objects, the case of acyclic cofibrations is [[formal dual|formally dual]]. Then in fact it has a genuine [[right inverse]] given by a lift $f^{-1}$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\rightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in cof}}\downarrow
     &{}^{{f^{-1}}}\nearrow&
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib \cap W}}
    \\
    X &=& X
  }
  \,.
$$

To see that $f^{-1}$ is also a [[left inverse]] up to [[left homotopy]], let $Cyl(X)$ be any [[cylinder object]] on $X$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), hence a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] on $X$ as a cofibration followed by a an acyclic fibration

$$
  X \sqcup X \stackrel{\iota_X}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

and consider the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    X \sqcup X
    &\stackrel{(f^{-1}\circ f, id)}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_X}}{}_{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(X) &\underset{f\circ p}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which [[commuting square|commutes]] due to $f^{-1}$ being a genuine right inverse of $f$. By construction, this [[commuting square]] now admits a [[lift]] $\eta$, and that constitutes a [[left homotopy]] $\eta \colon f^{-1}\circ f \Rightarrow_L id$.

###### Lemma

The construction in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} is indeed well defined.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, the object $P Q X$ is indeed both fibrant and cofibrant (as well as related by a [[zig-zag]] of weak equivalences to $X$):

$$
  \array{
     \emptyset
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\in Cof}}
     \\
     Q X &\underset{\in W \cap Cof}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X &\underset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}& \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined. First observe that any two choices $(Q f)_{i}$ of the first lift in the definition are left homotopic to each other, exhibited by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X \sqcup Q X &\stackrel{((Q f)_1, (Q f)_2 )}{\longrightarrow}& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow
     &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{Y}}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(Q X)
    &\underset{f \circ p_{X} \circ \sigma_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence also the composites $j_{Q Y}\circ (Q_f)_i $ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to each other, and since their domain is cofibrant, then by lemma \ref{LeftHomotopyWithCofibrantDomainImpliesRightHomotopyAndDually} they are also [[right homotopy|right homotopic]] by a right homotopy $\kappa$. This implies finally, by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Path(P Q Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow
     &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    P Q X &\underset{(R (Q f)_1, P (Q f)_2)}{\longrightarrow}&
    P Q Y \times P Q Y
  }
$$

that also $P (Q f)_1$ and $P (Q f)_2$ are right homotopic, hence that indeed $P Q f$ represents a well-defined [[homotopy class]].

Finally to see that the assignment is indeed [[functor|functorial]], observe that the commutativity of the lifting diagrams for $Q f$ and $P Q f$ imply that also the following diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now from the [[pasting]] composite

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_Y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q g}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q g}}
    \\
    Z &\underset{p_Z}{\longleftarrow}& Q Z &\underset{j_{Q Z}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Z
  }
$$

one sees that $(P Q g)\circ (P Q f)$ is a lift of $g \circ f$ and hence the same argument as above gives that it is homotopic to the chosen $P Q(g \circ f)$.


=--

For the following, recall the concept of [[natural isomorphism]] between [[functors]]: for $F, G \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ two functors, then a _[[natural transformation]]_ $\eta \colon F \Rightarrow G$ is for each object $c \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a morphism $\eta_c \colon F(c) \longrightarrow G(c)$ in $\mathcal{D}$, such that for each morphism $f \colon c_1 \to c_2$ in $\mathcal{C}$ the following is a [[commuting square]]:

$$

    {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{G(f)}}

$$

=--

([Quillen 67, I.1 theorem 1](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfUniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}
###### Proof

First, to see that that $\gamma_{P,Q}$ indeed takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms: By [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) applied to the [[commuting diagrams]] shown in the proof of lemma \ref{ConstructionOfLocalizationFunctorForModelCategoryIsWellDefined}, the morphism $P Q f$ is a weak equivalence if $f$ is:

$$
  \array{
    X &\underoverset{\simeq}{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\underoverset{\simeq}{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underoverset{p_y}{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underoverset{j_{Q Y}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
  }
$$

With this the "Whitehead theorem for model categories", lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}, implies that $P Q f$ represents an isomorphism in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.

Now let $F \colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow D$ be any functor that sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. We need to show that it factors as

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{C} && \overset{F}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma}}\searrow &\Downarrow^{\rho}& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde F}}
    \\
    && Ho(\mathcal{C})
  }
$$

uniquely up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Now by construction of $P$ and $Q$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, $\gamma_{P,Q}$ is the identity on the [[full subcategory]] of fibrant-cofibrant objects. It follows that if $\tilde F$ exists at all, it must satisfy for all $X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant that

$$
  \tilde F([f]) \simeq F(f)
  \,,
$$

(hence in particular $\tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(f)) = F(P Q f)$).

But by def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} that already fixes $\tilde F$ on all of $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Hence it only remains to check that with this definition of $\tilde F$ there exists any [[natural isomorphism]] $\rho$ filling the diagram above.

To that end, apply $F$ to the above [[commuting diagram]] to obtain

$$
  \array{
    F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(Q f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(P Q f)}}
    \\
    F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)}{iso}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here now all horizontal morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], by assumption on $F$. It follows that defining $\rho_X \coloneqq F(j_{Q X}) \circ F(p_X)^{-1}$ makes the required natural isomorphism:

$$
  \array{
    \rho_X \colon & F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q X)
   &=&
   \tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(X))
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow
     &&
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(P Q f)}}
     && \downarrow^{\tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(f))}
    \\
    \rho_Y\colon& F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)^{-1}}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q Y)

In general, the localization $\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ of a [[category with weak equivalences]] $(\mathcal{C},W)$ (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfACategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) may invert _more_ morphisms than just those in $W$. However, if the category admits the structure of a [[model category]] $(\mathcal{C},W,Cof,Fib)$, then its localization precisely only inverts the weak equivalences:

###### Proposition
**([[localization]] of [[model categories]] inverts precisely the [[weak equivalences]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] (def. \ref{ModelCategory}) and let $\gamma \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C})$ be its [[localization]] functor (def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}). Then a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[weak equivalence]] precisely if $\gamma(f)$ is an [[isomorphism]] in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.

While the construction of the homotopy category in def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} combines the restriction to good (fibrant/cofibrant) objects with the passage to [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms, it is often useful to consider intermediate stages:

###### Remark
**([[categories of fibrant objects]] and [[cofibration categories]])**

Of course the subcategories in def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects} inherit more structure than just that of [[categories with weak equivalences]] from $\mathcal{C}$. $\mathcal{C}_f$ and $\mathcal{C}_c$ each inherit "half" of the factorization axioms. One says that $\mathcal{C}_f$ has the structure of a "[[fibration category]]" called a "Brown-[[category of fibrant objects]]", while $\mathcal{C}_c$ has the structure of a "[[cofibration category]]".

We discuss properties of these categories of (co-)fibrant objects below in _[Homotopy fiber sequences](#HomotopyFiberSequences)_.

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[model category]], the restriction of the localization functor $\gamma\;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C})$ from def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} (using remark \ref{EssentialUniquenessOfLocalizationFunctorOfModelCategory}) to any of the sub-[[categories with weak equivalences]] of def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}

The following says that for computing the hom-sets in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]], even a mixed variant of the above will do; it is sufficient that the domain is cofibrant and the codomain is fibrant:

For $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$ with $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, and for $P, Q$ fibrant/cofibrant replacement functors as in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, then the morphism

$$
 Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P X,Q Y)

   \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, p_Y)}{\longrightarrow}
 Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_{\sim}
$$

(on [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms, well defined by prop. \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations}) is a [[natural bijection]].

([Quillen 67, I.1 lemma 7](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may factor the morphism in question as the composite

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Q Y)/_{\sim}
    \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_{P X}, p_Y)/_\sim }{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Y)/_{\sim}
    \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, id_Y)/_\sim}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_{\sim}
  \,.
$$

This shows that it is sufficient to see that for $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, then

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)/_\sim
   \;\colon\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Q Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim
$$

is an isomorphism, and dually that

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, id_Y)/_\sim
  \;\colon\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim
$$

is an isomorphism. We discuss this for the former; the second is [[formal dual|formally dual]]:

First, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is surjective is the [[lifting property]] in

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_Y}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which says that any morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ comes from a morphism $\hat f \colon X \to Q Y$ under postcomposition with $Q Y \overset{p_Y}{\to} Y$.

Second, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is injective is the lifting property in

$$
  \array{
    X \sqcup X &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_Y}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(X) &\underset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which says that if two morphisms $f, g \colon X \to Q Y$ become homotopic after postcomposition with $p_Y \colon Q X \to Y$, then they were already homotopic before.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] (def. \ref{ModelCategory}). Then every [[commuting square]] in its [[homotopy category]] $Ho(C)$ (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}) is, up to [[isomorphism]] of squares, in the image of the [[localization]] functor $\mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C})$ of a commuting square in $\mathcal{C}$ (i.e.: not just commuting up to homotopy).

$$

be a commuting square in the homotopy category. Writing the same symbols for fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ and for morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ representing these, then this means that in $\mathcal{C}$ there is a [[left homotopy]] of the form

$$

This exhibits the composite $A \overset{i_0}{\to} Cyl(A) \to Cyl(f)$ as an alternative representative of $f$ in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, and $Cyl(f) \to B'$ as an alternative representative for $b$, and the commuting square

The following proof refers to the [[factorization lemma]], whose full statement and proof we postpone to further below (lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the case of a functor on a [[category of fibrant objects]] $\mathcal{C}_f$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{C}_f$. Choose a [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}) and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    Path(f) &\underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_1^\ast f}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
    &(pb)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    Path(Y) &\overset{p_1}{\underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}}& Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_0}}_{\mathllap{\in W \cap Fib}}\downarrow
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where the square is a [[pullback]] and $Path(f)$ on the top left is our notation for the universal [[cone]] object. (Below we discuss this in more detail, it is the _[[mapping cocone]]_ of $f$, def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}).

Here:

1. $p_i$ are both acyclic fibrations, by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation};

1. $Path(f) \to X$ is an acyclic fibration because it is the pullback of $p_1$.

1. $p_1^\ast f$ is a weak equivalence, because the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} states that the composite vertical morphism factors $f$ through a weak equivalence, hence if $f$ is a weak equivalence, then $p_1^\ast f$ is by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

Now apply the functor $F$ to this diagram and use the assumption that it sends acyclic fibrations to weak equivalences to obtain

$$
  \array{
    F(Path(f)) &\underset{\in W }{\longrightarrow}& F(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(p_1^\ast f)}}_{\mathllap{}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}}
    \\
    F(Path(Y)) &\overset{F(p_1)}{\underset{\in W }{\longrightarrow}}& F(Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(p_0)}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

But the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}, in addition says that the vertical composite $p_0 \circ p_1^\ast f$ is a fibration, hence an acyclic fibration by the above. Therefore also $F(p_0 \circ p_1^\ast f)$ is a weak equivalence. Now the claim that also $F(f)$ is a weak equivalence follows with applying [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) twice.

###### Proof

We discuss the first case, the second is [[formal duality|formally dual]]. By the proof of theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{R}F(X)

     \gamma_{\mathcal{D}}F(Q(P(X)) )

$$

But since $F$ is a homotopical functor on fibrant objects, the cofibrant replacement morphism $F(Q(P(X)))\to F(P(X))$ is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$, hence becomes an isomorphism under $\gamma_{\mathcal{D}}$. Therefore

  \gamma_{\mathcal{D}}(F(P(X)))

Now since $F$ is assumed to preserve fibrant objects, $F(P(X))$ is fibrant in $\mathcal{D}$, and hence $\gamma_{\mathcal{D}}$ acts on it (only) by cofibrant replacement.

### Quillen adjunctions
 {#QuillenAdjunctions}

In practice it turns out to be useful to arrange for the assumptions in corollary \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors} to be satisfied by pairs of [[adjoint functors]] (Def. \ref{AdjointFunctorsInTermsOfNaturalBijectionOfHomSets}). Recall that this is a pair of [[functors]] $L$ and $R$ going back and forth between two categories

$$
  \mathcal{C}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \mathcal{D}
$$

such that there is a [[natural bijection]] between [[hom-sets]] with $L$ on the left and those with $R$ on the right (eq:HomIsomorphismForAdjointFunctors):

$$
  \phi_{d,c}
   \;\colon\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d),c)
   \underoverset{\simeq}{}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d, R(c))
$$

for all objects $d\in \mathcal{D}$ and $c \in \mathcal{C}$. This being _[[natural transformation|natural]]_ (Def. \ref{NaturalTransformations}) means that $\phi \colon Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(L(-),-) \Rightarrow Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-, R(-))$ is a [[natural transformation]], hence that for all morphisms $g \colon d_2 \to d_1$ and $f \colon c_1 \to c_2$ the following is a [[commuting square]]:

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d_1), c_1)
     & \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_{d_1,c_1}}{\longrightarrow} &
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d_1, R(c_1))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{L(f) \circ (-)\circ g}}\downarrow
     &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g\circ (-)\circ R(g)}}
    \\
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d_2), c_2)
     & \underoverset{\phi_{d_2, c_2}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} &
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d_2, R(c_2))
  }
  \,.
/$$

We write $(L \dashv R)$ to indicate such an [[adjunction]] and call $L$ the _[[left adjoint]]_ and $R$ the _[[right adjoint]]_ of the adjoint pair.

The archetypical example of a pair of adjoint functors is that consisting of forming [[Cartesian products]] $Y \times (-)$ and forming [[mapping spaces]] $(-)^Y$, as in the category of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] of def. \ref{kTop}.

If $f \colon L(d) \to c$ is any morphism, then the image $\phi_{d,c}(f) \colon d \to R(c)$ is called its _[[adjunct]]_, and conversely. The fact that adjuncts are in bijection is also expressed by the notation

$$
  \frac{
    L(c) \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} d
  }{
    c \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow} R(d)
  }
  \,.
$$

For an object $d\in \mathcal{D}$, the [[adjunct]] of the identity on $L d$ is called the _[[adjunction unit]]_ $\eta_d \;\colon\; d \longrightarrow R L d$.

For an object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the [[adjunct]] of the identity on $R c$ is called the _[[adjunction counit]]_ $\epsilon_c \;\colon\; L R c \longrightarrow c$.

Adjunction units and counits turn out to encode the [[adjuncts]] of all other morphisms by the formulas

* $\widetilde{(L d\overset{f}{\to}c)} = (d\overset{\eta}{\to} R L d \overset{R f}{\to} R c)$

* $\widetilde{(d\overset{g}{\to} R c)} = (L d \overset{L g}{\to} L R c \overset{\epsilon}{\to} c)$.

###### Proposition

The conditions in def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction} are indeed all equivalent.

=--

([Quillen 67, I.4, theorem 3](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that

* (i) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves acyclic cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves fibrations.

* (ii) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

We discuss statement (i), statement (ii) is [[formal dual|formally dual]].  So let $f\colon A \to B$ be an acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{D}$ and $g \colon X \to Y$ a fibration in $\mathcal{C}$. Then for every [[commuting diagram]] as on the left of the following, its $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] is a commuting diagram as on the right here:

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& R(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R(g)}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& R(Y)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    L(A) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{L(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    L(B) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If $L$ preserves acyclic cofibrations, then the diagram on the right has a [[lift]], and so the $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] of that lift is a lift of the left diagram. This shows that $R(g)$ has the [[right lifting property]] against all acylic cofibrations and hence is a fibration.
Conversely, if $R$ preserves fibrations, the same argument run from right to left gives that $L$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

Now by repeatedly applying (i) and (ii), all four conditions in question are seen to be equivalent.

The following is the analog of [[adjunction unit]] and [[adjunction counit]] (Def. \ref{AdjunctionUnitFromHomIsomorphism}):

1. a _derived adjunction counit_ at an object $c \in \mathcal{C}$ is a composition of the form

   $$
     L(Q(R(P(c))))
       \overset{ p_{R(P(c))} }{\longrightarrow}

   1. $c \underoverset{\in W_{\mathcal{C}} \cap Cof_{\mathcal{C}}}{j_c}{\longrightarrow} P c \underoverset{\in Fib_{\mathcal{C}}}{q_c}{\longrightarrow} \ast$ is a [[fibrant resolution]] in $\mathcal{C}$ (Def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory});

   1. $\emptyset \underoverset{\in Cof_{\mathcal{D}}}{i_{R(P(c))}}{\longrightarrow} Q(R(P(c))) \underoverset{\in W_{\mathcal{D}} \cap Fib_{\mathcal{D}}}{p_{R(P(c))}}{\longrightarrow} R(P(c))$ is a [[cofibrant resolution]] in $\mathcal{D}$ (Def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}).

=--

We will see that [[Quillen adjunctions]] induce ordinary [[adjoint pairs]] of [[derived functors]] on [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy categories]] (Prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}). For this we first consider the following technical observation:

+-- {: .num_lemma #LeftRightQuillenFunctorsPreserveCyclinderPathSpaceObjects}
###### Lemma
**([[right Quillen functors]] preserve [[path space objects]])**

Let $\mathcal{C} \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underoverset{R}{\bot}{\longrightarrow}} \mathcal{D}$ be a [[Quillen adjunction]], def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction}.

1. For $X \in \mathcal{C}$ a fibrant object and $Path(X)$ a [[path space object]] (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), then $R(Path(X))$ is a path space object for $R(X)$.

1. For $X \in \mathcal{C}$ a cofibrant object and $Cyl(X)$ a [[cylinder object]] (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), then $L(Cyl(X))$ is a cylinder object for $L(X)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the second case, the first is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

First Observe that  $L(Y \sqcup Y) \simeq L Y \sqcup L Y$ because $L$ is [[left adjoint]] and hence preserves [[colimits]], hence in particular [[coproducts]].

Hence

$$
  L(\X \sqcup X \overset{\in Cof}{\to} Cyl(X))
  =
  (L(X) \sqcup L(X) \overset{\in Cof}{\to } L (Cyl(X)))
$$

is a cofibration.

Second, with $Y$ cofibrant then also $Y \sqcup Cyl(Y)$ is a cofibrantion, since $Y \to Y \sqcup Y$ is a cofibration (lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation}). Therefore by [[Ken Brown's lemma]] (prop. \ref{KenBrownLemma}) $L$ preserves the weak equivalence $Cyl(Y) \overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow} Y$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}
###### Proposition
**([[Quillen adjunction]] descends to [[homotopy categories]])**

For $\mathcal{C} \underoverset{\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{{}_{\phantom{Qu}}\bot_{Qu}}\mathcal{D}$ a [[Quillen adjunction]], def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction}, also the corresponding left and right [[derived functors]] (Def. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctorsOnModelCategories}, via cor. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors}) form a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C})
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\mathbb{R}R}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{\mathbb{L}L}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  Ho(\mathcal{D})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the [[adjunction unit]] and [[adjunction counit]] of this derived adjunction are the images of the [[derived adjunction unit]] and [[derived adjunction counit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit}) under the [[localization]] functors (Theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}).


=--

([Quillen 67, I.4 theorem 3](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement, by def. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctorsOnModelCategories} and lemma \ref{HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory} it is sufficient to see that for $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$ with $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, then there is a [[natural bijection]]

\[
  \label{HomIsomorphismForDerivedQuillenAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategory}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L X , Y)/_\sim
   \simeq
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, R Y)/_\sim
  \,.
\]

Since by the [[adjoint functor|adjunction isomorphism]] for $(L \dashv R)$ such a natural bijection exists before passing to homotopy classes $(-)/_\sim$, it is sufficient to see that this respects homotopy classes. To that end, use from lemma \ref{LeftRightQuillenFunctorsPreserveCyclinderPathSpaceObjects} that with $Cyl(Y)$ a [[cylinder object]] for $Y$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, then $L(Cyl(Y))$ is a cylinder object for $L(Y)$. This implies that left homotopies

$$
  (f \Rightarrow_L g) \;\colon\;  L X \longrightarrow Y
$$

given by

$$
 \eta \;\colon\; Cyl(L X) =  L Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y
$$

are in bijection to left homotopies

$$
  (\tilde f \Rightarrow_L \tilde g) \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow R Y
$$

given by

$$
  \tilde \eta \;\colon\; Cyl(X) \longrightarrow R X
  \,.
$$

This establishes the adjunction. Now regarding the (co-)units:
We show this for the adjunction unit, the case of the adjunction counit is [[formal duality|formally dual]].

First observe that for $d \in \mathcal{D}_c$, then the defining [[commuting square]] for the [[left derived functor]] from def. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctorsOnModelCategories}

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}_c &\overset{L}{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{C}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\gamma_P}}\downarrow
      &\swArrow_{\simeq}&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_{P,Q}}}
    \\
    Ho(\mathcal{D}) &\underset{\mathbb{L}L}{\longrightarrow}& Ho(\mathcal{C})
  }
$$

(using fibrant and [[fibrant replacement|fibrant/cofibrant replacement functors]] $\gamma_P$, $\gamma_{P,Q}$ from def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} with their universal property from theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, corollary \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects}) gives that

$$
  (\mathbb{L} L ) d \simeq P L P d \simeq P L d \;\;\;\; \in Ho(\mathcal{C})
  \,,
$$

where the second isomorphism holds because the left Quillen functor $L$ sends the acyclic cofibration $j_d \colon d \to P d$ to a weak equivalence.

The adjunction unit of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ on $P d \in Ho(\mathcal{C})$ is the image of the identity under

$$
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}((\mathbb{L}L) P d, (\mathbb{L} L) P d)
  \overset{\simeq}{\to}
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P d, (\mathbb{R}R)(\mathbb{L}L) P d)
  \,.
$$

By the above and the proof of prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}, that adjunction isomorphism is equivalently that of $(L \dashv R)$ under the isomorphism

$$
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P L d , P L d)
    \overset{Hom(j_{L d}, id)}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L d, P L d)/_\sim
$$

of lemma \ref{HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory}. Hence the [[derived adjunction unit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit}) is the $(L \dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] of

$$
  L d
    \overset{j_{L d}}{\longrightarrow}
  P L d
    \overset{id}{\to}
  P L d
  \,,
$$

which indeed (by the formula for [[adjuncts]], Prop. \ref{GeneralAdjunctsInTermsOfAdjunctionUnitCounit}) is the [[derived adjunction unit]]

$$
  X
    \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}
  R L d
    \overset{R (j_{L d})}{\longrightarrow}
  R P L d
  \,.
$$

This suggests to regard passage to [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy categories]] and [[derived functors]] as itself being a suitable [[functor]] from a category of [[model categories]] to the [[category of categories]]. Due to the role played by the distinction between [[left Quillen functors]] and [[right Quillen functors]], this is usefully formulated as a [[double functor]]:

By Prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories} the components of the [[adjunction unit]]/[[adjunction counit|counit]] of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ are precisely the images under [[localization]] of the [[derived adjunction unit]]/[[derived adjunction counit|counit]] of $(L \underset{Qu}{\dashv} R)$. Moreover, by Prop. \ref{MorphismIsWeakEquivalenceIfIsoInHomotopyCategoryForQuillen} the localization functor of a [[model category]] inverts precisely the [[weak equivalences]]. Hence the adjunction (co-)unit of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ is an isomorphism if and only if the derived (co-)unit of $(L \underset{Qu}{\dashv} R)$ is a weak equivalence, respectively.

([Quillen 67, I.4, theorem 3](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That $1) \Leftrightarrow 2)$ follows from prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories} (if in an adjoint pair one is an equivalence, then so is the other).

To see the equivalence $1),2) \Leftrightarrow 3)$, notice ([prop.](adjoint+functor#FullyFaithfulAndInvertibleAdjoints)) that a pair of [[adjoint functors]] is an [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if both the [[adjunction unit]] and the [[adjunction counit]] are [[natural isomorphisms]]. Hence it is sufficient to see that the [[derived adjunction unit]]/[[derived adjunction counit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit}) indeed represent the [[adjunction unit|adjunction (co-)unit]] of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]]. But this is the statement of Prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}.

To see that $4) \Rightarrow 3)$:

Consider the weak equivalence $L X \overset{j_{L X}}{\longrightarrow} P L X$. Its $(L \dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] is

$$
  X
    \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}
  R L X
    \overset{R j_{L X}}{\longrightarrow}
  R P L X
$$

by assumption 4) this is again a weak equivalence, which is the requirement for the [[derived adjunction unit]] in 3). Dually for [[derived adjunction counit]].

To see $3) \Rightarrow 4)$:

Consider any $f \colon L d \to c$ a weak equivalence for cofibrant $d$, firbant $c$. Its [[adjunct]] $\tilde f$ sits in a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \tilde f \colon & d &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&  R L d &\overset{R f}{\longrightarrow}& R c
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{=}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R j_{L d}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R j_c}}
    \\
    & d &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& R P L d &\overset{R P f}{\longrightarrow}& R P c
  }
  \,,
$$

where $P f$ is any lift constructed as in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}.

This exhibits the bottom left morphism as the [[derived adjunction unit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit}), hence a weak equivalence by assumption. But since $f$ was a weak equivalence, so is $P f$ (by [[two-out-of-three]]).  Thereby also $R P f$ and $R j_Y$, are weak equivalences by [[Ken Brown's lemma]] \ref{KenBrownLemma} and the assumed fibrancy of $c$. Therefore by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) also the [[adjunct]] $\tilde f$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Proposition
**(recognition of [[Quillen equivalences]])**

If in a [[Quillen adjunction]]  $ \array{\mathcal{C} &\underoverset{\underset{R}{\to}}{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\bot}& \mathcal{D}}$ (def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction}) the [[right adjoint]] $R$ "creates weak equivalences" (in that a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is a weak equivalence precisly if $U(f)$ is) then $(L \dashv R)$ is a [[Quillen equivalence]] (def. \ref{QuillenEquivalence}) precisely already if for all [[cofibrant objects]] $d \in \mathcal{D}$ the plain [[adjunction unit]]

$$
  d \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow} R (L (d))
$$

is a [[weak equivalence]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ConditionsForQuillenAdjunctionAreIndeedEquivalent}, generally, $(L \dashv R)$ is a Quillen equivalence precisely if

1. for every [[cofibrant object]] $d\in \mathcal{D}$, the [[derived adjunction unit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit})

   $$
     d
       \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}
     R(L(d))
       \overset{R(j_{L(d)})}{\longrightarrow}
     R(P(L(d)))
   $$

   is a [[weak equivalence]];

1. for every [[fibrant object]] $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the [[derived adjunction counit]] (Def. \ref{DerivedAdjunctionUnit})

   $$
     L(Q(R(c)))
       \overset{L(p_{R(c)})}{\longrightarrow}
     L(R(c))
       \overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}
     c
   $$

   is a [[weak equivalence]].

Consider the first condition: Since $R$ preserves the weak equivalence $j_{L(d)}$, then by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) the composite in the first item is a weak equivalence precisely if $\eta$ is.

Hence it is now sufficient to show that in this case the second condition above is automatic.

Since $R$ also reflects weak equivalences, the composite in item two is a weak equivalence precisely if its image

$$
  R(L(Q(R(c))))
    \overset{R(L(p_{R(c))})}{\longrightarrow}
  R(L(R(c)))
    \overset{R(\epsilon)}{\longrightarrow}
  R(c)
$$

under $R$ is.

Moreover, assuming, by the above, that $\eta_{Q(R(c))}$ on the cofibrant object $Q(R(c))$ is a weak equivalence, then by [[two-out-of-three]] this composite is a weak equivalence precisely if the further composite with $\eta$ is

$$
  Q(R(c))
    \overset{\eta_{Q(R(c))}}{\longrightarrow}
  R(L(Q(R(c))))
    \overset{R(L(p_{R(c))})}{\longrightarrow}
  R(L(R(c)))
    \overset{R(\epsilon)}{\longrightarrow}
  R(c)
  \,.
$$

By the formula for [[adjuncts]], this composite is the $(L\dashv R)$-adjunct of the original composite, which is just $p_{R(c)}$

$$
  \frac{
     L(Q(R(c)))
       \overset{L(p_{R(c)})}{\longrightarrow}
     L(R(c))
       \overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}
     c
  }{
     Q(R(C)) \overset{p_{R(c)}}{\longrightarrow} R(c)
  }
  \,.
$$

But $p_{R(c)}$ is a weak equivalence by definition of cofibrant replacement.

Instead of going through the full theory of what this means, we observe that this is plausibly modeled by the following construction, and then we check ([below](#HomotopyFibers)) that this indeed has the relevant abstract homotopy theoretic properties.

For $\mathcal{C} =$ [[Top]] with $Cyl(X) = X\times I$ the standard cyclinder object, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, then by example \ref{PushoutInTop}, the [[mapping cone]], def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. attaching to one end of that cylinder the space $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Accordingly the [[suspension]] of a topological space is the result of shrinking both ends of the cylinder on the object two the point. This is homeomoprhic to attaching two copies of the cone on the space at the base of the cone.

$$

+-- {: .num_prop #UnreducedMappingConeAsReducedConeOfBasedPointAdjoined}
###### Proposition

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism in [[Top]], then its unreduced mapping cone, remark \ref{UnreducedCone}, with respect to the standard cylinder object $X \times I$ def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, is isomorphic to the reduced mapping cone, def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, of the morphism $f_+ \colon X_+ \to Y_+$ (with a basepoint adjoined, def. \ref{BasePointAdjoined}) with respect to the standard [[reduced cylinder]] (example \ref{StandardReducedCyclinderInTop}):

$$
  Cone'(f) \simeq Cone(f_+)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects} and example \ref{WedgeAndSmashOfBasePointAdjoinedTopologicalSpaces}, $Cone(f_+)$ is given by the colimit in $Top$ over the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast &\overset{(f,id)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \sqcup\ast &\longrightarrow& (X \times I) \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone(f_+)
  }
  \,.
$$

We may factor the vertical maps to give

$$
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast &\overset{(f,id)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \sqcup\ast &\longrightarrow& (X \times I) \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast \sqcup \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone'(f)_+
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone'(f)
  }
  \,.
$$



This way the top part of the diagram (using the [[pasting law]] to compute the colimit in two stages) is manifestly a cocone under the result of applying $(-)_+$ to the diagram for the unreduced cone. Since $(-)_+$ is itself given by a colimit, it preserves colimits, and hence gives the partial colimit $Cone'(f)_+$ as shown. The remaining pushout then contracts the remaining copy of the point away.

=--


Example \ref{MappingConesInTopologicalSpaces} makes it clear that every [[cycle]] $S^n \to Y$ in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be _continuously_ translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it shrinks away to the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$, def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}, in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping cone **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it intuitively clear how $Cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. We now discuss this formally.

1. the composite morphism $X \overset{i_0}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \overset{(i_1)_\ast f}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(f)$ is a cofibration;

1. $f$ factors through this morphism by a weak equivalence left inverse to an acyclic cofibration

1. the composite morphism $Path(f) \overset{p_1^\ast f}{\longrightarrow} Path(Y) \overset{p_0}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is a fibration;

1. $f$ factors through this morphism by a weak equivalence right inverse to an acyclic fibration:

   $$

We discuss the second case. The first case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

So consider the [[mapping cocylinder]]-construction from prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder}

$$
  \array{
     Path(f) &\overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_1^\ast f}}\downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}

     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Fib}}\downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_0}}
     \\
     Y
  }
  \,.
$$


To see that the vertical composite is indeed a fibration, notice that, by the [[pasting law]], the above pullback diagram may be decomposed as a [[pasting]] of two pullback diagram as follows

$$
  \array{
    Path(f)
     &\underoverset{\in Fib}{(f,id)^\ast(p_1,p_0)}{\longrightarrow}&
     X \times Y
     &\stackrel{pr_1}{\to}&
     X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(f, Id)}} && \downarrow^\mathrlap{f}
     \\
     Path(Y) &\overset{(p_1,p_0) \in Fib }{\longrightarrow}&
     Y \times Y &\stackrel{pr_1}{\longrightarrow}&
     Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_0}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{pr_2 \atop {\in Fib}}}
     \\
     Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Both squares are pullback squares. Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, the morphism $Path(f) \to X \times Y$ is a fibration.
Similarly, since $X$ is fibrant, also the [[projection]] map $X \times Y \to Y$ is a fibration (being the pullback of $X \to \ast$ along $Y \to \ast$).

Since the vertical composite is thereby exhibited as the composite of two fibrations

$$
   Path(f)
     \overset{(f,id)^\ast(p_1,p_0)}{\longrightarrow}
   X \times Y
     \stackrel{pr_2 \circ (f ,Id) = pr_2}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,,
$$

it is itself a fibration.

Then to see that there is a weak equivalence as claimed:

The [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]] $Path(f)$ induces a right inverse of $Path(f) \to X$ fitting into this diagram

$$
  \array{
     id_X \colon & X &\underoverset{\in W}{\exists}{\longrightarrow}
       & Path(f)
       &
         \overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
       X
     \\
     & {}^{\mathrlap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     id_Y\colon& Y
       &\underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow}&
     Path(Y)
       &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}& Y
     \\
     & & {}_{\mathllap{Id}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_0}}
     \\
     & && Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which is a weak equivalence, as indicated, by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

This establishes the claim.

+-- {: .num_proof}
###### Proof

For $f \in Fib$ the statement follows from the [[pasting law]] which says that if in

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1 &\longrightarrow& A_1
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{u^* f \in Fib}}
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \in Fib}}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_2 &\longrightarrow& A_2
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}} && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    B' &\stackrel{u}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
$$

the bottom and the total square are pullback squares, then so is the top square. The same reasoning applies for $f \in W \cap Fib$.

Now to see the case that $f\in W$:

Consider the [[full subcategory]] $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$ of the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ (def. \ref{SliceCategory}) on its fibrant objects, i.e. the full subcategory of the slice category on the fibrations

$$
  \array{
    X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    B
  }
$$

into $B$. By factorizing for every such fibration the [[diagonal morphisms]] into the [[fiber product]] $X \underset{B}{\times} X$ through a weak equivalence followed by a fibration, we obtain path space objects $Path_B(X)$ relative to $B$:

$$
  \array{
   (\Delta_X)/B
   \;\colon
    &
    X
      &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path_B(X)
      &\overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
    X \underset{B}{\times} X
    \\
    & & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    & && B
  }
  \,.
$$

With these, the [[factorization lemma]] (lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}) applies in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$.

(Notice that for this we do need the restriction of $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ to the fibrations, because this ensures that the projections $p_i \colon X_1 \times_B X_2 \to X_i$ are still fibrations, which is used in the proof of the factorization lemma ([here](#ProofOfFactorizationLemma)).)

So now given any

$$
  \array{
    X && \underoverset{\in W}{f}{\longrightarrow} && Y
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

apply the [[factorization lemma]] in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$ to factor it as

$$
  \array{
    X
      &\overset{i \in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path_B(f)
      &\overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow
     &\downarrow&
    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && B
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous discussion it is sufficient now to show that the base change of $i$ to $B'$ is still a weak equivalence. But by the factorization lemma in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$, the morphism $i$ is right inverse to another acyclic fibration over $B$:

$$
  \array{
    id_X
    \;\colon
    &
    X
      &\overset{i \in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path_B(f)
      &\overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & &
    {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow
     &\downarrow&
    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    & && B
  }
  \,.
$$

(Notice that if we had applied the factorization lemma of $\Delta_X$ in $\mathcal{C}_f$ instead of $(\Delta_X)/B$ in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})$ then the corresponding triangle on the right here would not commute.)

Now we may reason as before: the base change of the top morphism here is exhibited by the following pasting composite of pullbacks:

$$
  \array{
    B' \underset{B}{\times} X
     &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    B' \underset{B}{\times} Path_B(f)
      &\longrightarrow&
    Path_B(f)
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    B' \underset{B}{\times}X
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    B'
     &\longrightarrow&
    B
  }
  \,.
$$

The acyclic fibration $Path_B(f)$ is preserved by this pullback, as is the identity $id_X \colon X \to Path_B(X)\to X$. Hence the weak equivalence $X \to Path_B(X)$ is preserved by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

###### Lemma

In a [[category of fibrant objects]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}, the pullback of a weak equivalence along a fibration is again a weak equivalence.

=--

([Brown 73, section 4, lemma 2](#Brown73))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let
$u \colon B' \to B$ be a weak equivalence and
$ p \colon E \to B$ be a fibration. We want to show that the
left vertical morphism in the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\longrightarrow& B'
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Rightarrow \in W} }
    && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
$$

is a weak equivalence.

First of all, using the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}
we may factor $B' \to B$ as

$$
  B'
    \stackrel{\in W}{\longrightarrow}
  Path(u)
   \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\longrightarrow}
  B
$$

with the first morphism a weak equivalence that is a right inverse to an acyclic fibration and the right one an acyclic fibration.

Then the pullback diagram in question may be decomposed
into two consecutive pullback diagrams

$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\to& B'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Q &\stackrel{\in Fib}{\to}& Path(u)
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the morphisms are indicated as fibrations and
acyclic fibrations using the stability of these
under arbitrary pullback.

This means that the proof reduces to proving that weak equivalences
$u : B' \stackrel{\in W}{\to} B$
that are right inverse to some acyclic fibration
$v : B \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B'$
map to a weak equivalence under pullback along a fibration.

Given such $u$ with right inverse $v$, consider the pullback diagram


$$
  \array{
    & E
    \\
    &
    {}^{\mathllap{{(p,id)}\atop \in W}}\downarrow
    &
      \searrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    E_1 \coloneqq
      &
    B \times_{B'} E
      &
    \stackrel{\in W \cap Fib }{\longrightarrow}
      &
    E
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p \in Fib }}
    \\
    & &(pb)& B
    \\
    & \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{v \in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    & B &\overset{v \in Fib \cap W}{\longrightarrow}& B'
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that the indicated universal morphism  $p \times Id \colon E \stackrel{\in W}{\to} E_1$  into the pullback is a weak equivalence by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

The previous lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences} says that weak equivalences between fibrations over $B$ are themselves preserved by base extension along $u \colon B' \to B$. In total this yields the following diagram


$$
  \array{
    &&
    u^* E = B' \times_B E
      &\longrightarrow &
    E
    \\
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{ {u^*(p \times Id)} \atop {\in W} }}\downarrow
      &&
    {}^{\mathllap{ {p \times Id} \atop {\in W}  }}\downarrow
     &
    \searrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    &&
    u^* E_1
      &\longrightarrow&
    E_1
      &\stackrel{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    &&\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}&&\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p \in Fib}}
    \\
    &&&&&& B
    \\
    &&\downarrow&&\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{v \in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    &&
    B'
      &\stackrel{u}{\longrightarrow}&
    B
      &\stackrel{v \in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
    B'
  }
$$

so that with $p \times Id  : E \to E_1$ a weak equivalence also $u^* (p \times Id)$ is a weak equivalence, as indicated.

Notice that $u^* E = B' \times_B E \to E$ is the morphism that we want to show is a weak equivalence. By [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) for that it is now sufficient to show that $u^* E_1  \to E_1$ is a weak equivalence.

That finally follows now since, by assumption, the total bottom horizontal morphism is the identity. Hence so is the top horizontal morphism. Therefore $u^\ast E_1  \to E_1$ is right inverse to a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence.

(meaning: both squares commute and $t$ equalizes $f$ with $g$) then the [[localization]] functor $\gamma \colon (\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_f \to Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ (def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, cor \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects}) takes the morphisms $fib(p_1) \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} fib(p_2)$ induced by $f$ and $g$ on [[fibers]] (example \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects})  to the same morphism, in the homotopy category.

=--

([Brown 73, section 4, lemma 4](#Brown73))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the pullback of $p_2$ along $u$: this forms the same kind of diagram but with the bottom morphism an identity. Hence it is sufficient to consider this special case.

Consider the [[full subcategory]] $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B})_f$ of the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B}$ (def. \ref{SliceCategory}) on its fibrant objects, i.e. the full subcategory of the slice category on the fibrations

$$
  \array{
    X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    B
  }
$$

into $B$. By factorizing for every such fibration the [[diagonal morphisms]] into the [[fiber product]] $X \underset{B}{\times} X$ through a weak equivalence followed by a fibration, we obtain path space objects $Path_B(X)$ relative to $B$:

$$
  \array{
   (\Delta_X)/B
   \;\colon
    &
    X
      &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path_B(X)
      &\overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
    X \underset{B}{\times} X
    \\
    & & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    & && B
  }
  \,.
$$

With these, the [[factorization lemma]] (lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}) applies in $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B})_f$.

Let then $X\overset{s}{\to}Path_B(X_2)\overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\to} X_2 \times_B X_2$ be a [[path space object]] for $X_2$ in the slice over $B$ and consider the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    X'_1 &\overset{s f t}{\longrightarrow}& Path_B(X_2)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{t}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0,p_1)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    X_1 &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X_2\underset{B}{\times} X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

By factoring this through the pullback $(f,g)^\ast(p_0,p_1)$ and then applying the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} and then [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) to the factoring morphisms, this may be replaced by a commuting square of the same form, where however the left morphism is an acyclic fibration

$$
  \array{
    X''_1 &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& Path_B(X_2)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{t}}_{\mathllap{\in W\cap Fib}} \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0,p_1)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    X_1 &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X_2\underset{B}{\times} X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

This makes also the morphism $X''_1 \to B$ be a fibration, so that the whole diagram may now be regarded as a diagram in the category of fibrant objects $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$ of the [[slice category]] over $B$.

As such, the top horizontal morphism now exhibits a [[right homotopy]] which under [[localization]] $\gamma_B \;\colon\; (\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C}_{/B})$ (def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}) of the [[slice model structure]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) we have

$$
  \gamma_B(f) = \gamma_B(g)
  \,.
$$

The result then follows by observing that we have a commuting square of [[functors]]

$$
  \array{
     (\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B})_f &\overset{fib}{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_B}} &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma}}
     \\
     Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B}) &\longrightarrow& Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  }
  \,,
$$

because, by lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences}, the top and right composite sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms, and hence the bottom filler exists by theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}. This implies the claim.

###### Remark

The [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} with prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} says that the [[mapping cocone]] of a morphism $f$, def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, is equivalently the plain [[fiber]], example \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, of a fibrant resolution $\tilde f$ of $f$:

$$

The following prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} says that, up to equivalence, this situation is independent of the specific fibration resolution $\tilde f$ provided by the [[factorization lemma]] (hence by the prescription for the [[mapping cocone]]), but only depends on it being _some_ fibration resolution.

and observe that

1. $fib(f^\ast p_2) = pt^\ast f^\ast p_2 = pt^\ast p_2 = fib(p_2)$;

1. $f^\ast X_2 \to X_2$ is a weak equivalence by lemma \ref{InCfPullbackAlongFibrationPreservesWeakEquivalences};

1. $X_1 \to f^\ast X_2$ is a weak equivalence by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences});

Moreover, this diagram exhibits $h \colon fib(p_1)\to fib(f^\ast p_2) = fib(p_2)$ as the base change, along $\ast \to Y_1$, of $X_1 \to f^\ast X_2$. Therefore the claim now follows with lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences}.

as in the proof of lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}. Now by repeatedly using prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences}:

1. the bottom square gives a weak equivalence from the fiber of $Path(f_1) \to Path(Y)$ to the fiber of $f_1$;

1. The square

   $$
     \array{
        Path(f_1) &\overset{id}{\longrightarrow}& Path(f_1)
        \\
        \downarrow && \downarrow
        \\
        Path(Y) &\underset{p_0}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     }
   $$

   gives a weak equivalence from the fiber of $Path(f_1) \to Path(Y)$ to the fiber of $Path(f_1)\to Y$.

1. Similarly the total vertical composite gives a weak equivalence via

   $$
     \array{
        Path(f) &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& Path(f_1)
        \\

from the fiber of $Path(f) \to Y$ to the fiber of $Path(f_1)\to Y$.

Together this is a [[zig-zag]] of weak equivalences of the form

$$
  fib(f_1)
    \;\overset{\in W}{\longleftarrow}\;
  fib(Path(f_1)\to Path(Y))

  fib(Path(f) \to Y)

between the fiber of $Path(f) \to Y$ and the fiber of $f_1$. This gives an isomorphism in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]].

###### Example
**(fibers of Serre fibrations)**

In showing that [[Serre fibrations]] are abstract fibrations in the sense of [[model category]] theory, theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} implies that the [[fiber]] $F$ (example \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}) of a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}

$$
  \array{
    F &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

over any point is actually a [[homotopy fiber]] in the sense of def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}. With prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} this implies that the [[weak homotopy type]] of the fiber only depends on the Serre fibration up to weak homotopy equivalence in that if $p' \colon X' \to B'$ is another Serre fibration fitting into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}& X'
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p'}}
    \\
    B &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}& B'
  }
$$

then $F \overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow} F'$.

In particular this gives that the [[weak homotopy type]] of the fiber of a Serre fibration $p \colon X \to B$ does not change as the basepoint is moved in the same connected component. For let $\gamma \colon I \longrightarrow B$ be a path between two points

$$
  b_{0,1}
    \;\colon\;
  \ast
    \underoverset{\in W_{cl}}{i_{0,1}}{\longrightarrow}
  I
    \overset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}
  B
  \,.
$$

Then since all objects in $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ are fibrant, and since the endpoint inclusions $i_{0,1}$ are weak equivalences, lemma \ref{InCfPullbackAlongFibrationPreservesWeakEquivalences} gives the [[zig-zag]] of top horizontal weak equivalences in the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
    F_{b_0} = & b_0^\ast p
      &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \gamma^{\ast}p
      &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longleftarrow}&
    b_1^\ast p
    &
    = F_{b_1}
    \\
    & \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow{\mathrlap{{\gamma^\ast f} \atop {\in \atop {Fib}}}} &\;\;(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    & \ast
      &\underoverset{i_0}{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}&
    I
      &\underoverset{i_1}{\in W_{cl}}{\longleftarrow}&
    \ast
  }
$$

and hence an isomorphism $F_{b_0} \simeq F_{b_1}$ in the [[classical homotopy category]] (def. \ref{ClassicalHomotopyCategory}).

The same kind of argument applied to maps from the square $I^2$ gives that if $\gamma_1, \gamma_2\colon I \to B$ are two homotopic paths with coinciding endpoints, then the isomorphisms between fibers over endpoints which they induce are equal. (But in general the isomorphism between the fibers does depend on the choice of homotopy class of paths connecting the basepoints!)

The same kind of argument also shows that if $B$ has the structure of a [[cell complex]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}) then the restriction of the Serre fibration to one cell $D^n$ may be identified in the homotopy category with  $D^n \times F$, and may be canonically identified so if the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ is trivial. This is used when deriving the [[Serre spectral sequence|Serre]]-[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] for $p$ ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#AHSSExistence)).

By prop. \ref{TopologicalCylinderOnCWComplexIsGoodCylinderObject}, for $X$ a [[CW-complex]] then the standard topological cylinder object $X\times I$ is indeed a  cyclinder object in $Top_{Quillen}$. Therefore by prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} and the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}, the mapping cone construction indeed produces first a cofibrant replacement of $f$ and then the ordinary cofiber of that, hence a model for the homotopy cofiber.

$$
  \array{

We may now state the abstract version of the statement of prop. \ref{SerreFibrationGivesExactSequenceOfHomotopyGroups}:

+-- {: .num_prop #ExactSequenceOfHomotopyFiberAtOneStage}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. For $f \colon X \to Y$ any morphism of [[pointed objects]], and for $A$ a [[pointed object]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, then the sequence

$$
  [A,hofib(f)]_\ast \overset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow} [A,X]_\ast \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow} [A,Y]_{\ast}
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]] as a sequence of [[pointed sets]].

(Where the sequence here is the image of the [[homotopy fiber]] sequence of def. \ref{HomotopyFiber} under the hom-functor $[A,-]_\ast \;\colon\; Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}) \longrightarrow Set^{\ast/}$ from example \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfPointedModelStructureIsEnrichedInPointedSets}.)


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $A$, $X$ and $Y$ denote fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ representing the given objects of the same name in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$. Moreover, let $f$ be a fibration in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ representing the given morphism of the same name in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$.

Then by def. \ref{HomotopyFiber} and prop.
\ref{HomotopyFiberIndependentOfChoiceOfFibrantReplacement} there is a representative $hofib(f) \in \mathcal{C}$ of the homotopy fiber which fits into a pullback diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

With this the hom-sets in question are represented by genuine morphisms in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$, modulo homotopy. From this it follows immediately that $im(i_\ast)$ includes into $ker(f_\ast)$. Hence it remains to show the converse: that every element in $ker(f_\ast)$ indeed comes from $im(i_\ast)$.

But an element in $ker(f_\ast)$ is represented by a morphism $\alpha \colon A \to X$ such that there is a left homotopy as in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
     && A &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     && {}^{\mathllap{i_0}}\downarrow &{}^{\tilde \eta}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     A &\overset{i_1}{\longrightarrow} & Cyl(A) &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
     \\
     \ast && \longrightarrow && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} the square here has a lift $\tilde \eta$, as shown. This means that $i_1 \circ\tilde \eta$ is left homotopic to $\alpha$. But by the universal property of the fiber, $i_1 \circ \tilde \eta$ factors through $i \colon hofib(f) \to X$.

With prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} it also follows notably that the loop space construction becomes well-defined on the homotopy category:

+-- {: .num_remark #ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject}
###### Remark

Given an object $X \in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_f$, and picking any [[path space object]] $Path(X)$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} with induced [[loop space object]] $\Omega X$, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, write $Path_2(X) = Path(X) \underset{X}{\times} Path(X)$ for the [[path space object]] given by the fiber product  of $Path(X)$ with itself, via example \ref{ComposedPathSpaceObjects}. From the pullback diagram there, the fiber inclusion $\Omega X \to Path(X)$ induces a morphism

$$
  \Omega X \times \Omega X \longrightarrow (\Omega X)_2
  \,.
$$

In the case where $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/} = Top^{\ast/}$ and $\Omega$ is induced, via def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, from the standard path space object (def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}), i.e. in the case that

$$
  \Omega X = fib(Maps(I_+,X)_\ast \longrightarrow X \times X)
  \,,
$$

then this is the operation of concatenating two loops parameterized by $I = [0,1]$ to a single loop parameterized by $[0,2]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. Then the construction of forming [[loop space objects]] $X\mapsto \Omega X$, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject} (which on $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_f$ depends on a choice of [[path space objects]], def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}) becomes unique up to isomorphism in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}) of the [[slice model structure|model structure on pointed objects]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) and extends to a [[functor]]:

$$
  \Omega
    \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Dually, the [[reduced suspension]] operation, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, which on $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ depends on a choice of [[cylinder object]], becomes a functor on the homotopy category

$$
  \Sigma
   \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the pairing operation induced on the objects in the image of this functor via remark \ref{ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject} (concatenation of loops) gives the objects in the image of $\Omega$ [[group object]] structure, and makes this functor lift as

$$

  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Grp(Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}))
  \,.
$$

=--

([Brown 73, section 4, theorem 3](#Brown73))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Given an object $X \in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ and given two choices of path space objects $Path(X)$ and $\widetilde{Path(X)}$, we need to produce an isomorphism in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ between $\Omega X$ and $\tilde \Omega X$.

To that end, first lemma \ref{ReplacementOfPathObjects} implies that any two choices of path space objects are connected via a third path space by a [[span]] of morphisms compatible with the structure maps. By [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) every morphism of path space objects compatible with the inclusion of the base object is a weak equivalence. With this, lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences} implies that these morphisms induce weak equivalences on the corresponding loop space objects. This shows that all choices of loop space objects become isomorphic in the homotopy category.

Moreover, all the isomorphisms produced this way are actually equal: this follows from lemma \ref{UniquenessOfFibersOfQualizedMorphismsInHoC} applied to

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}& Path(X) &\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}& \widetilde{Path(X)}
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     && X\times X &\overset{id}{\longrightarrow}&  X \times X
  }
  \,.
$$

This way we obtain a functor

$$
  \Omega \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_f \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} (and using that Cartesian product preserves weak equivalences) this functor sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. Therefore the functor on homotopy categories now follows with theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}.

It is immediate to see that the operation of loop concatenation from remark \ref{ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject} gives the objects $\Omega X \in Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ the structure of [[monoids]]. It is now sufficient to see that these are in fact groups:

We claim that the inverse-assigning operation is given by the left map in the following pasting composite

$$
  \array{
    \Omega' X &\longrightarrow& Path'(X) &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{swap}}
    \\
    \Omega X &\longrightarrow& Path(X) &\underset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
  }
  \,,
$$

(where $Path'(X)$, thus defined, is the path space object obtained from $Path(X)$ by "reversing the notion of source and target of a path").

To see that this is indeed an inverse, it is sufficient to see that the two morphisms

$$
  \Omega X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} (\Omega X)_2
$$

induced from

$$
  \array{
  Path(X)
\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{(s\circ p_0,s \circ p_0)}{\longrightarrow}}
  Path(X) \times_X Path'(X)
 }
$$

coincide in the homotopy category. This follows with lemma \ref{UniquenessOfFibersOfQualizedMorphismsInHoC} applied to the following commuting diagram:

$$
  \array{
    X
      &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path(X)
      &\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{(s\circ p_0,s \circ p_0)}{\longrightarrow}}&
    Path(X)\times_X Path'(X)
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{(p_0,p_1)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}

where the inner morphisms are fibrations and weak equivalences, as shown, by the pullback stability of fibrations (prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}) and then since pullback along fibrations preserves weak equivalences by assumption of [[right proper model category|right properness]] (def. \ref{RightProperModelCategory}).
Hence it follows by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) that also the comparison morphism $A \to \hat C \underset{D}{\times} B$ is a weak equivalence.

In conclusion, if the homotopy pullback condition is satisfied for one factorization of $g$, then it is satisfied for all factorizations of $f$. Since the argument is symmetric in $f$ and $g$, this proves the claim.

###### Proof

(The reader should draw the 3-dimensional cube diagram which we describe in words now.)

First consider the universal morphism $C \to E \underset{F}{\times} C$ and observe that it is a weak equivalence by [[right proper model category|right properness]] (def. \ref{RightProperModelCategory})
and [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

Then consider the universal morphism $A \underset{B}{\times}C \to A \underset{B}{\times}(E \underset{F}{\times}C)$ and observe that this is also a weak equivalence, since $A \underset{B}{\times} C$ is the limiting cone of a homotopy pullback square by remark \ref{PullbackOfFibrationWithFibrantObjectsIsHomotopyPullback}, and since the morphism is the comparison morphism to the pullback of the factorization constructed in the first step.

Now by using the [[pasting law]], then the commutativity of the "left" face of the cube, then the pasting law again, one finds that $A \underset{B}{\times} (E \underset{F}{\times} C) \simeq A \underset{D}{\times} (D \underset{E} F{\times})$. Again by [[right proper model category|right properness]] this implies that $A \underset{B}{\times} (E \underset{F}{\times} C)\to D \underset{E}{\times} F$ is a weak equivalence.

With this the claim follows by [[two-out-of-three]].

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[right proper model category]] (def. \ref{RightProperModelCategory}).
If in a [[commuting square]] in $\mathcal{C}$ one edge is a weak equivalence, then the square is a [[homotopy pullback]] square precisely if the opposite edge is a weak equivalence, too.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider a commuting square of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& D
  }
  \,.
$$

To detect whether this is a homotopy pullback, by def. \ref{HomotopyPullback} and prop. \ref{ConditionsForHomotopyPullbackAreIndeedEquivalent}, we are to choose any factorization of the right vertical morphism to obtain the pasting composite

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    C \underset{D}{\times} \hat B
      &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    \hat B
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    C &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& D
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the morphism in the middle is a weak equivalence by [[right proper model category|right properness]] (def. \ref{RightProperModelCategory}). Hence it follows by [[two-out-of-three]] that the top left comparison morphism is a weak equivalence (and so the original square is a homotopy pullback) precisely if the top morphism is a weak equivalence.

   the square on the right is a homotoy pullback (def. \ref{HomotopyPullback}) then the left square is, too, precisely if the total rectangle is;

1. in the presence of [[functorial factorization]] (def. \ref{FunctorialFactorization}) through weak equivalences followed by fibrations:

   every [[retract]] of a homotopy pullback square (in the category $\mathcal{C}_f^{\Box}$ of commuting squares in $\mathcal{C}_f$) is itself a homotopy pullback square.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement: choose a factorization of $C \overset{\in W}{\to} \hat F \overset{\in Fib}{\to} F$, pull it back to a factorization $B \to \hat B \overset{\in Fib}{\to} E$ and assume that $B \to \hat B$ is a weak equivalence, i.e. that the right square is a homotopy pullback. Now use the ordinary [[pasting law]] to conclude.


For the second statement: functorially choose a factorization of the two right vertical morphisms of the squares and factor the squares through the pullbacks of the corresponding fibrations along the bottom morphisms, respectively. Now the statement that the squares are homotopy pullbacks is equivalent to their top left vertical morphisms being weak equivalences. Factor these top left morphisms functorially as cofibrations followed by acyclic fibrations. Then the statement that the squares are homotopy pullbacks is equivalent to those top left cofibrations being acyclic. Now the claim follows using that the retract of an acyclic cofibration is an acyclic cofibration (prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}).

### Long fiber sequences
 {#LongSequences}

The ordinary [[fiber]], example \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, of a morphism has the property that taking it _twice_ is always trivial:

$$
   \ast \simeq fib(fib(f)) \longrightarrow fib(f) \longrightarrow X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

This is crucially different for the [[homotopy fiber]], def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}. Here we discuss how this comes about and what the consequences are.

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyFiberOfHomotopyFiberIsLooping}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}_f$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]] of a [[model category]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects} and let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism in its [[category of pointed objects]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}. Then the [[homotopy fiber]] of its [[homotopy fiber]], def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}, is isomorphic, in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$, to the [[loop space object]] $\Omega Y$ of $Y$ (def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}):

$$
  hofib(hofib(X \overset{f}{\to}Y)) \simeq \Omega Y
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume without restriction that $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is already a fibration between fibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ (otherwise replace and rename). Then its homotopy fiber is its ordinary fiber, sitting in a [[pullback]] square

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) \simeq & F &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

In order to compute $hofib(hofib(f))$, i.e. $hofib(i)$, we need to replace the fiber inclusion $i$ by a fibration. Using the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} for this purpose yields, after a choice of [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), a replacement of the form

$$
  \array{
    F &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& F \times_X Path(X)
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{i}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde i}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $hofib(i)$ is the ordinary fiber of this map:

$$
  hofib(hofib(f)) \simeq  F \times_X Path(X) \times_X \ast \;\;\;\; \in Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Notice that

$$
  F \times_X Path(X) \; \simeq \; \ast \times_Y Path(X)
$$

because of the [[pasting law]]:

$$
  \array{
     F \times_X Path(X) &\longrightarrow& Path(X)
     \\
     \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
     \\
     F &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  hofib(hofib(f))
    \;\simeq\;
  \ast \times_Y Path(X) \times_X \ast
  \,.
$$

Now we claim that there is a choice of path space objects $Path(X)$ and $Path(Y)$ such that this model for the homotopy fiber (as an object in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$) sits in a [[pullback]] diagram of the following form:

$$
  \array{
    \ast \times_Y Path(X) \times_X \ast &\longrightarrow& Path(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow\mathrlap{\in W \cap F}
    \\
    \Omega Y &\longrightarrow& Path(Y)\times_Y X
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow&  Y \times X
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[pasting law]] and the pullback stability of acyclic fibrations, this will prove the claim.

To see that the bottom square here is indeed a pullback, check the [[universal property]]: A morphism out of any $A$ into $\ast \underset{Y \times X}{\times} Path(Y) \times_Y X$ is a morphism $a \colon A \to Path(Y)$ and a morphism $b \colon A \to X$ such that $p_0(a) = \ast$, $p_1(a) = f(b)$ and $b = \ast$. Hence it is equivalently just a morphism $a \colon A \to Path(Y)$ such that $p_0(a) = \ast$ and $p_1(a) = \ast$. This is the defining universal property of $\Omega Y \coloneqq \ast \underset{Y}{\times} Path(Y) \underset{Y}{\times} \ast$.

Now to construct the right vertical morphism in the top square ([Quillen 67, page 3.1](model+category#Quillen67)): Let $Path(Y)$ be any path space object for $Y$ and let $Path(X)$ be given by a factorization

$$
  (id_X, \; i \circ f, \; id_X)
  \;\colon\;
  X
  \overset{\in W}{\to}
  Path(X)
  \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times_Y Path(Y) \times_Y X
$$

and regarded as a path space object of $X$ by further comoposing with

$$
  (pr_1,pr_3)\colon X \times_Y Path(Y) \times_Y X \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

We need to show that $Path(X)\to Path(Y) \times_Y X$ is an acyclic fibration.

It is a fibration because $X\times_Y Path(Y) \times_Y X \to Path(Y)\times_Y X$ is a fibration, this being the pullback of the fibration $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$.

To see that it is also a weak equivalence, first observe that $ Path(Y)\times_Y X \overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow} X$, this being the pullback of the acyclic fibration of lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation}. Hence we have a factorization of the identity as

$$
  id_X
  \;\colon\;
  X
    \underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow}
  Path(X)
    \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  Path(Y)\times_Y X
    \underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}
  X
$$

and so finally the claim follows by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #HomotopyCommutativeSquares}
###### Remark

There is a conceptual way to understand prop. \ref{HomotopyFiberOfHomotopyFiberIsLooping} as follows:
If we draw double arrows to indicate [[homotopies]], then a [[homotopy fiber]] (def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}) is depicted by the following filled square:

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

just like the ordinary [[fiber]] (example \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}) is given by a plain square

$$
  \array{
    fib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

One may show that just like the fiber is the _universal_ solution to making such a commuting square (a [[pullback]] [[limit|limit cone]] def. \ref{Limits}), so the homotopy fiber is the universal solution up to homotopy to make such a commuting square up to homotopy -- a [[homotopy pullback]] [[homotopy limit|homotopy limit cone]].

Now just like ordinary [[pullbacks]] satisfy the [[pasting law]] saying that attaching two pullback squares gives a pullback rectangle, the analogue is true for homotopy pullbacks. This implies that if we take the homotopy fiber of a homotopy fiber, thereby producing this double homotopy pullback square

$$
  \array{
    hofib(g) &\longrightarrow& hofib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

then the total outer rectangle here is itself a homotopy pullback. But the outer rectangle exhibits the homotopy fiber of the point inclusion, which, via def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject} and lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}, is the [[loop space object]]:

$$
  \array{
    \Omega Y &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.

###### Proposition
**([[long homotopy fiber sequences]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a model category and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be morphism in the pointed homotopy category $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}). Then:

1. There is a long sequence to the left in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ of the form

   where each morphism is the [[homotopy fiber]] (def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}) of the following one: the **[[homotopy fiber sequence]]** of $f$. Here $\overline{\Omega}f$ denotes $\Omega f$ followed by forming inverses with respect to the group structure on $\Omega(-)$ from prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}.

   Moreover, for $A\in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ any object, then there is a [[long exact sequence]]

   of [[pointed sets]], where $[-,-]_\ast$ denotes the pointed set valued hom-functor of example \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfPointedModelStructureIsEnrichedInPointedSets}.

1. Dually, there is a long sequence to the right in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ of the form

   where each morphism is the [[homotopy cofiber]] (def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}) of the previous one: the **[[homotopy cofiber sequence]]** of $f$. Moreover, for $A\in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ any object, then there is a [[long exact sequence]]

([Quillen 67, I.3, prop. 4](model+category#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That there are long sequences of this form is the result of combining prop. \ref{HomotopyFiberOfHomotopyFiberIsLooping} and  prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfHomotopyFiberAtOneStage}.

It only remains to see that it is indeed the morphisms $\overline{\Omega} f$ that appear, as indicated.

In order to see this, it is convenient to adopt the following notation: for $f \colon X \to Y$ a morphism, then we denote the collection of [[generalized element]] of its homotopy fiber as

$$
  hofib(f)
  =
  \left\{
    (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast)
  \right\}
$$

indicating that these elements are pairs consisting of an element $x$ of $X$ and a "path" (an element of the given path space object) from $f(x)$ to the basepoint.

This way the canonical map $hofib(f) \to X$ is $(x, f(x) \rightsquigarrow \ast) \mapsto x$. Hence in this notation the homotopy fiber of the homotopy fiber reads

$$
  hofib(hofib(f))
  =
  \left\{
    ( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast),
            x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  )
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This identifies with $\Omega Y$ by forming the loops

$$
  \gamma_1 \cdot f(\overline{\gamma_2})
  \,,
$$

where the overline denotes reversal and the dot denotes concatenation.

Then consider the next homotopy fiber

$$
  hofib(hofib(hofib(f)))
  =
  \left\{
    \left(
      ( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast), x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  ),
      \left(
      \array{
         x && \overset{\gamma_3}{\rightsquigarrow} && \ast
         \\
         f(x) &&\overset{f(\gamma_3)}{\rightsquigarrow}&& \ast
         \\
         & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma_1}}\searrow & \Rightarrow & \swarrow_{\mathllap{}}
         \\
         && \ast
      }
      \right)
    \right)
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have a path in $hofib(f)$ from $(x, f(x)\overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast)$ to the basepoint element. This is a path $\gamma_3$ together with a path-of-paths which connects $f_1$ to $f(\gamma_3)$.

By the above convention this is identified with the loop in $X$ which is

$$
  \gamma_2 \cdot (\overline{\gamma}_3)
  \,.
$$

But the map to $hofib(hofib(f))$ sends this data to $( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast), x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  )$, hence to the loop

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \gamma_1 \cdot f( \overline{\gamma_2} )
    & \simeq
    f(\gamma_3) \cdot f(\overline{\gamma_2})
    \\
    & =
    f( \gamma_3 \cdot \overline{\gamma_2} )
    \\
    & =
    f ( \overline{\gamma_2 \cdot \overline{\gamma}_3} )
    \\
    & =
    \overline{f(\gamma_2 \cdot \overline{\gamma}_3) }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

hence to the reveral of the image under $f$ of the loop in $X$.

In ([Quillen 67, I.3, prop. 3, prop. 4](model+category#Quillen67)) more is shown than stated in prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence}: there the [[connecting homomorphism]] $\Omega  Y \to hofib(f)$ is not just shown to exist, but is described in detail via an [[action]] of $\Omega Y$ on $hofib(f)$ in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$. This takes a good bit more work. For our purposes here, however, it is sufficient to know that such a morphism exists at all, hence that $\Omega Y \simeq hofib(hofib(f))$.

Then using the  standard pointed topological path space objects $Maps(I_+,X)$ from def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} and example \ref{PointedMappingSpace} as the abstract path space objects in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, via prop. \ref{TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}, this gives that

is the $n$th [[homotopy group]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}, of $X$ at its basepoint.

Hence using $A = \ast$ in the first item of prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence}, the [[long exact sequence]] this gives is of the form

(Further [below](#ModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces) we restrict attention to the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]].)


### Universal constructions

To begin with, we recall some basics on [[universal constructions]] in [[Top]]: [[limits]] and [[colimits]] of [[diagrams]] of [[topological spaces]]; [[exponential objects]].


We now discuss [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (Def. \ref{Limits}) in $\mathcal{C}= $ [[Top]]. The key for understanding these is the fact that there are initial and final topologies:

+-- {: .num_defn #InitialAndFinalTopologies}
###### Definition

Let $\{X_i = (S_i,\tau_i) \in Top\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[set]] of [[topological spaces]], and let $S \in Set$ be a bare [[set]]. Then

1. For $\{S \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S_i \}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] out of $S$, the **[[initial topology]]** $\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[minimum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon (S,\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))\to X_i$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

1. For $\{S_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S\}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] into $S$, the **[[final topology]]** $\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[maximum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon X_i \to (S,\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalSubspace}
###### Example

For $X$ a single topological space, and $\iota_S \colon S \hookrightarrow U(X)$ a subset of its underlying set, then the initial topology $\tau_{intial}(\iota_S)$, def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, is the [[subspace topology]], making

$$
  \iota_S
  \;\colon\;
  (S, \tau_{initial}(\iota_S))
  \hookrightarrow
  X
$$

a [[topological subspace]] inclusion.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #QuotientTopology}
###### Example

Conversely, for $p_S \colon U(X) \longrightarrow S$ an [[epimorphism]], then the final topology $\tau_{final}(p_S)$ on $S$ is the _[[quotient topology]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop}
###### Proposition

Let $I$ be a [[small category]] and let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be an $I$-[[diagram]] in [[Top]] (a [[functor]] from $I$ to $Top$), with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
       \\
       S_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && S_j
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

   $$
     \array{
       S_i && \longrightarrow && S_j
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_j}}
       \\
       && \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{final}(\{\iota_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

=--

(e.g. [Bourbaki 71, section I.4](#Bourbaki71))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The required [[universal property]] of $\left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)$ (def. \ref{Limits}) is immediate: for

$$
  \array{
    && (S,\tau)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_j}}
    \\
    X_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
  }
$$

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the [[initial topology]] ensures.

The case of the colimit is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

The limit over the empty diagram in $Top$ is the [[point]] $\ast$ with its unique topology.

+-- {: .num_example #DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpacesIsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[coproduct]] $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i \in Top$ is their _[[disjoint union]]_.

=--


In particular:

+-- {: .num_example #DiscreteTopologicalSpaceAsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $S \in Set$, the $S$-indexed [[coproduct]] of the point, $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod}\ast $  is the set $S$ itself equipped with the [[final topology]], hence is the [[discrete topological space]] on $S$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ProductTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[product]] $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i \in Top$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets equipped with the _[[product topology]]_, also called the _[[Tychonoff product]]_.

In the case that $S$ is a [[finite set]], such as for binary product spaces $X \times Y$, then a [[basis for a topology|sub-basis]] for the product topology is given by the [[Cartesian products]] of the open subsets of (a basis for) each factor space.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #EqualizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[equalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the equalizer of the underlying functions of sets

$$
  eq(f,g)
   \hookrightarrow
  S_X
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}}
  S_Y
$$

(hence the largets subset of $S_X$ on which both functions coincide) and equipped with the [[subspace topology]], example \ref{TopologicalSubspace}.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #CoequalizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[coequalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the coequalizer of the underlying functions of sets

$$
  S_X
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}}
  S_Y
    \longrightarrow
  coeq(f,g)
$$

(hence the [[quotient set]] by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by $f(x) \sim g(x)$ for all $x \in X$)  and equipped with the [[quotient topology]], example \ref{QuotientTopology}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #PushoutInTop}
###### Example

For

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
$$

two [[continuous functions]] out of the same [[domain]], then the [[colimit]] under this diagram is also called the _[[pushout]]_, denoted

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g_\ast f}}
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup_A Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.
$$

(Here $g_\ast f$ is also called the pushout of $f$, or the _[[base change|cobase change]]_ of $f$ along $g$.)

This is equivalently the [[coequalizer]] of the two morphisms from $A$ to the [[coproduct]] of $X$ with $Y$ (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpacesIsCoproduct}):

$$
  A
   \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
  X \sqcup Y
   \longrightarrow
  X \sqcup_A Y
  \,.
$$


If $g$ is an inclusion, one also writes $X \cup_f Y$ and calls this the _[[attaching space]]_.

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;"><img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AttachingSpace.jpg" width="450"></div>

By example \ref{CoequalizerInTop} the [[pushout]]/[[attaching space]] is the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  X \sqcup_A Y \simeq (X\sqcup Y)/\sim
$$

of the [[disjoint union]] of $X$ and $Y$ subject to the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies a point in $X$ with a point in $Y$ if they have the same pre-image in $A$.

(graphics from [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))

Notice that the defining [[universal property]] of this colimit means that completing the [[span]]

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself}
###### Example

An important special case of example \ref{PushoutInTop}:

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | \; {\vert \vec x \vert \leq 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-disk]] (equipped with its [[subspace topology]] as a subset of [[Cartesian space]]);

* $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | \; {\vert \vec x \vert = 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for its [[boundary]], the standard topological [[n-sphere]].

Notice that $S^{-1} = \emptyset$ and that $S^0 = \ast \sqcup \ast$.

Let

$$
  i_n \colon S^{n-1}\longrightarrow D^n
$$

be the canonical inclusion of the standard [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] as the [[boundary]] of the standard [[n-disk]] (both regarded as [[topological spaces]] with their [[subspace topology]] as subspaces of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$).

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">

$$
     D^n \overset{i_n}{\longleftarrow} S^{n-1} \overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}
     D^n

i.e. the [[pushout]] of $i_n$ along itself, is the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n

Another kind of colimit that will play a role for certain technical constructions is [[transfinite composition]]. First recall

+-- {: .num_defn #PosetsWosetTosetsAndOrdinals}
###### Definition

A _[[partial order]]_ is a [[set]] $S$ equipped with a [[relation]] $\leq$ such that for all elements $a,b,c \in S$

1) ([[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]) $a \leq a$;

2) ([[transitive relation|transitivity]]) if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$;

3) ([[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]) if $a\leq b$ and $\b \leq a$ then $a = b$.

This we may and will equivalently think of as a [[category]] with [[objects]] the elements of $S$ and a unique morphism $a \to b$ precisely if $a\leq b$. In particular an order-preserving function between partially ordered sets is equivalently a [[functor]] between their corresponding categories.

A _[[bottom element]]_ $\bot$ in a partial order is one such that $\bot \leq a$ for all a. A _[[top element]]_ $\top$ is one for wich $a \leq \top$.

A partial order is a _[[total order]]_ if in addition

4) ([[total relation|totality]]) either $a\leq b$ or $b \leq a$.

A total order is a _[[well order]]_ if in addition

5) ([[well-founded relation|well-foundedness]]) every non-empty subset has a least element.

An _[[ordinal]]_ is the [[equivalence class]] of a well-order.

The _[[successor]]_ of an ordinal is the class of the well-order with a [[top element]] freely adjoined.

A _[[limit ordinal]]_ is one that is not a successor.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ExamplesOfOrdinals}
###### Example

The finite ordinals are labeled by $n \in \mathbb{N}$, corresponding to the well-orders $\{0 \leq 1 \leq 2 \cdots \leq n-1\}$. Here $(n+1)$ is the successor of $n$. The first non-empty limit ordinal is $\omega = [(\mathbb{N}, \leq)]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TransfiniteComposition}
###### Definition


Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]], and let $I \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ be a [[class]] of its morphisms.

For $\alpha$ an [[ordinal]] (regarded as a [[category]]), an $\alpha$-indexed _transfinite sequence_ of elements in $I$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  X_\bullet
    \;\colon\;
  \alpha \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

such that

1. $X_\bullet$ takes all [[successor]] morphisms $\beta \stackrel{\leq}{\to} \beta + 1$ in $\alpha$ to elements in $I$

   $$
     X_{\beta,\beta + 1} \in I
   $$

1. $X_\bullet$ is _continuous_ in that for every nonzero [[limit ordinal]] $\beta \lt \alpha$, $X_\bullet$ restricted to the [[full subcategory|full-subdiagram]] $\{\gamma \;|\; \gamma \leq \beta\}$ is a [[colimit|colimiting cocone]] in $\mathcal{C}$ for $X_\bullet$ restricted to $\{\gamma \;|\; \gamma \lt \beta\}$.

The corresponding **transfinite composition** is the induced morphism

$$
  X_0 \longrightarrow X_\alpha \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}X_\bullet
$$

into the [[colimit]] of the diagram, schematically:

$$
  \array{
    X_0 &\stackrel{X_{0,1}}{\to}& X_1
    &\stackrel{X_{1,2}}{\to}& X_2
    &\to& \cdots
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow & \cdots
    \\
    &&
    X_\alpha
  }
  \,.
$$

=--


We now turn to the discussion of [[mapping spaces]]/[[exponential objects]].


+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]] (in that for every point, every [[neighbourhood]] contains a [[compact topological space|compact]] neighbourhood), the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]]

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous
functions]] $Y \to X$,

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[unions]] of [[finitary intersections]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] elements of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U^K \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of all those [[continuous functions]] $f$ that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

Accordingly this is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

The construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lc}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]] (in that for each point, each open neighbourhood contains a [[compact subset|compact]] [[neighbourhood]]), the **topological [[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]], i.e. the functor $(-)^Y$ is [[right adjoint]] to the product functor $Y \times (-)$: there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

=--

A proof is spelled out [here](compact-open+topology#GivesExponentialObject)
(or see e.g. [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, prop. 1.3.1](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)).

+-- {: .num_remark #UseOfHausdorffnessInCOTopology}
###### Remark

In the context of prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} it is often assumed that $Y$ is also a [[Hausdorff topological space]]. But this is not necessary. What assuming Hausdorffness only achieves is that all alternative definitions of "locally compact" become equivalent to the one that is needed for the proposition: for every point, every open neighbourhood contains a compact neighbourhood.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #ProblemWithExponentialsInTop}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails in general if $Y$ is not locally compact. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]].

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance for various constructions that one would like to perform within that homotopy theory. For instance on general [[pointed topological spaces]] the [[smash product]] is in general not [[associativity|associative]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{cg} \hookrightarrow Top$ (def. \ref{kTop}) which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]]. This we turn to [below](#ModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces).

### Homotopy

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is clearly that of _[[homotopy]]_. In the context of [[topological spaces]] this is about [[continuous function|contiunous]] deformations of [[continuous functions]] parameterized by the standard interval:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard [[topological interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

Equipped with the canonical inclusion of its two endpoints

$$
  \ast \sqcup \ast \stackrel{(\delta_0,\delta_1)}{\longrightarrow} I \stackrel{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$

this is the standard [[interval object]] in [[Top]].

For $X \in Top$, the [[product topological space]] $X\times I$, example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}, is called the standard _[[cylinder object]]_ over $X$. The endpoint inclusions of the interval make it factor the [[codiagonal]] on $X$

$$
  \nabla_X
    \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{((id,\delta_0),(id,\delta_1))}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times I

###### Example

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x,y \in X$ be two of its points, regarded as functions $x,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X$ from the point to $X$. Then a left homotopy, def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form

A key application of the concept of left homotopy is to the definition of [[homotopy groups]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then its set $\pi_0(X)$
of _[[connected components]]_, also called the **0-th homotopy set**,
is the set of
[[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] (def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}) of points $x \colon \ast \to X$, hence the set of path-connected components of $X$ (example \ref{PathsAsLeftHomotopyBetweenPoints}). By [[composition]] this extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \pi_0 \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$ and for $x \colon \ast \to X$

**([[homotopy equivalence]])**

A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
is called a **[[homotopy equivalence]]** if there exists a
continuous function the other way around,
$g \;\colon\; Y \longrightarrow X$, and [[left homotopies]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, from the two composites to the identity:

$$
  \eta_1 \;\colon\; f\circ g \Rightarrow_L id_Y
$$

and

$$
  \eta_2 \;\colon\; g\circ f \Rightarrow_L id_X
  \,.
$$

If here $\eta_2$ is constant along $I$, $f$ is said to exhibit $X$ as a **[[deformation retract]]** of $Y$.

###### Proposition

Every [[homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence, def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.

In particular a [[deformation retraction]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that for all $X\in$ [[Top]] the inclusion maps

$$
  X \overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow} X \times I
$$

into the standard [[cylinder object]], def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, are weak homotopy equivalences: by postcomposition with the contracting homotopy of the interval from example \ref{StandardContractionOfStandardInterval} all homotopy groups of $X \times I$ have representatives that factor through this inclusion.

Then given a general [[homotopy equivalence]], apply the homotopy groups functor to the corresponding homotopy diagrams (where for the moment we notationally suppress the choice of basepoint for readability) to get two commuting diagrams

$$
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(X)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(f)\circ \pi_\bullet(g)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(X \times I) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(\eta)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(Y)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(id)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(X)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(Y)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(g)\circ \pi_\bullet(f)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(Y \times I) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(\eta)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(X)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(id)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous observation, the vertical morphisms here are isomorphisms, and hence these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as the inverse of $\pi_\bullet(g)$, hence both as isomorphisms.

+-- {: .num_remark #NotEveryHomotopyEquivalenceIsAWeakHomotopyEquivalence}
###### Remark

The converse of prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} is not true generally: not every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] between topological spaces is a [[homotopy equivalence]].  (For an example with full details spelled out see for instance Fritsch, Piccinini: "Cellular Structures in Topology", p. 289-290).

However, as we will discuss below, it turns out that

1. every weak homotopy equivalence between [[CW-complexes]] is a homotopy equivalence ([[Whitehead's theorem]], cor. \ref{WhiteheadTheorem});

1. every topological space is connected by a weak homotopy equivalence to a CW-complex ([[CW approximation]], remark \ref{EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex}).

For $X\in Top$, the projection $X\times I \longrightarrow X$
from the [[cylinder object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval},
is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.  This means that the factorization

$$

of the [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$ in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, which in general is far from being a [[monomorphism]], may be thought of as factoring it through a monomorphism after replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by $X\times I$.

In fact, further below (prop. \ref{StandardContractionOfStandardInterval}) we see that $X \sqcup X \to X \times I$ has better properties than the generic monomorphism has, in particular better homotopy invariant properties:
it has the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Serre fibrations]] $ E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} B$ that are also [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

**([[path space]])**

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its **standard topological [[path space object]]** is the topological [[path space]], hence the [[mapping space]] $X^I$, prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}, out of the standard interval $I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The endpoint inclusion into the standard interval, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, makes the path space $X^I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} factor the [[diagonal]] on $X$ through the inclusion of constant paths and the endpoint evaluation of paths:


$$
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \stackrel{X^{I \to \ast}}{\longrightarrow} X^I \stackrel{X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

This is the [[formal dual]] to example \ref{TopologicalInterval}. As in that example, below we will see (prop. \ref{TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}) that this factorization has good properties, in that

1. $X^{I \to \ast}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

1. $X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

So while in general the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ is far from being an [[epimorphism]] or even just a [[Serre fibration]], the factorization through the [[path space object]] may be thought of as replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by its path space, such as to turn its diagonal into a Serre fibration after all.

Strictly speaking a relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is a function $f\colon X \to Y$, _together_ with its cell structure, hence together with the information of the pushout diagrams and the transfinite composition of the pushout maps that exhibit it.

In many applications, however,  all that matters is that there is _some_ (relative) cell decomosition, and then one tends to speak loosely and mean by a (relative) cell complex only a (relative) topological space that admits some cell decomposition.

+-- {: .num_lemma #CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
###### Lemma

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[law of excluded middle]],
every [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspace]] of a topological [[cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, intersects the [[interior]] of a [[finite number]] of cells.

=--

(e.g. [Hirschhorn 15, section 3.1](#Hirschhorn15))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

So let $Y$ be a topological cell complex and $C \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspace]]. Define a subset

$$
  P \subset Y
$$

by _choosing_ one point in the [[interior]] of the intersection with $C$ of each cell of $Y$ that intersects $C$.

It is now sufficient to show that $P$ has no [[accumulation point]]. Because, by the [[compact topological space|compactness]] of $X$, every non-finite subset of $C$ does have an accumulation point, and hence the lack of such shows that $P$ is a [[finite set]] and hence that $C$ intersects the interior of finitely many cells of $Y$.

To that end, let $c\in C$ be any point. If $c$ is a 0-cell in $Y$, write $U_c \coloneqq \{c\}$. Otherwise write $e_c$ for the unique cell of $Y$ that contains $c$ in its [[interior]]. By construction, there is exactly one point of $P$ in the interior of $e_c$. Hence there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $c \in U_c \subset e_c$ containing no further points of $P$ beyond possibly $c$ itself, if $c$ happens to be that single point of $P$ in $e_c$.

It is now sufficient to show that $U_c$ may be enlarged to an open subset $\tilde U_c$ of $Y$ containing no point of $P$, except for possibly $c$ itself, for that means that $c$ is not an accumulation point of $P$.

To that end, let $\alpha_c$ be the [[ordinal]] that labels the stage $Y_{\alpha_c}$ of the [[transfinite composition]] in the [[cell complex]]-presentation of $Y$ at which the cell $e_c$ above appears. Let $\gamma$ be the ordinal of the full cell complex. Then define the set

$$
  T
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \;
    (\beta, U)
    \;|\;
    \alpha_c \leq \beta \leq \gamma
    \;\,,\;
    U \underset{open}{\subset} Y_\beta
    \;\,,\;
    U \cap Y_\alpha = U_c
    \;\,,\;
    U \cap P \in \{ \emptyset, \{c\} \}
    \;
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

and regard this as a [[partially ordered set]] by declaring a partial ordering via

$$
  (\beta_1, U_1) \lt (\beta_2, U_2)
  \;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;
  \beta_1 \lt \beta_2
  \;\,,\;
  U_2 \cap Y_{\beta_1} = U_1
  \,.
$$

This is set up such that every element $(\beta, U)$ of $T$ with $\beta$ the maximum value $\beta = \gamma$ is an extension $\tilde U_c$ that we are after.

Observe then that for $(\beta_s, U_s)_{s\in S}$ a chain in $(T,\lt)$ (a subset on which the relation $\lt$ restricts to a [[total order]]), it has an upper bound in $T$ given by the [[union]] $({\cup}_s \beta_s ,\cup_s U_s)$. Therefore [[Zorn's lemma]] applies, saying that $(T,\lt)$ contains a [[maximal element]] $(\beta_{max}, U_{max})$.

Hence it is now sufficient to show that $\beta_{max} = \gamma$. We argue this by showing that assuming $\beta_{\max}\lt \gamma$ leads to a contradiction.

So assume $\beta_{max}\lt \gamma$. Then to construct an  element of $T$ that is larger than $(\beta_{max},U_{max})$, consider for each cell $d$ at stage $Y_{\beta_{max}+1}$ its [[attaching map]] $h_d \colon S^{n-1} \to Y_{\beta_{max}}$ and the corresponding preimage open set $h_d^{-1}(U_{max})\subset S^{n-1}$. Enlarging all these  preimages to open subsets of $D^n$ (such that their image back in $X_{\beta_{max}+1}$ does not contain $c$), then $(\beta_{max}, U_{max}) \lt (\beta_{max}+1, \cup_d U_d )$. This is a contradiction. Hence $\beta_{max} = \gamma$, and we are done.

###### Proof

Let $X \longrightarrow \hat X = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{\beta \leq \alpha} X_\beta$ be a $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]].

First observe that with the elements $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ of $J_{Top}$ being [[homotopy equivalences]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (by example \ref{ProjectionFromStandardCylinderIsHomotopyEquivalence}), each of the stages $X_{\beta} \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}$ in the relative cell complex is also a homotopy equivalence. We make this fully explicit:

By definition, such a stage is a [[pushout]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}

     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
     &\longrightarrow&

$$

Then the fact that the projections $p_{n_i} \colon D^{n_i} \times I \to D^{n_i}$ are strict left inverses to the inclusions $(id, \delta_0)$ gives a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$

     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
       &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
  }
$$

and so the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] ([[pushout]]) $X_{\beta + 1}$ gives a factorization of the identity morphism on the right through $X_{\beta + 1}$

$$
  \array{
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
     &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (id, \delta_0)} }\downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{}
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
       &\longrightarrow&
     X_{\beta + 1}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} p_{n_i} }}\downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
       &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
  }
$$

which exhibits $X_{\beta + 1} \to X_\beta$ as a strict left inverse to $X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta + 1}$. Hence it is now sufficient to show that this is also a homotopy right inverse.

To that end, let

$$
  \eta_{n_i} \colon D^{n_i}\times I \longrightarrow D^{n_i} \times I
$$

be the [[left homotopy]] that exhibits $p_{n_i}$ as a homotopy right inverse to $p_{n_i}$ by example \ref{ProjectionFromStandardCylinderIsHomotopyEquivalence}. For each $t \in [0,1]$ consider the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
      &\longrightarrow&
    X_\beta
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
    && X_{\beta + 1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\eta_{n_i}(-,t)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
     &\longrightarrow&
    X_{\beta + 1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Regarded as a [[cocone]] under the [[span]] in the top left, the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] ([[pushout]]) $X_{\beta + 1}$ gives a continuous function

$$
  \eta(-,t) \;\colon\; X_{\beta + 1} \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}
$$

for each $t \in [0,1]$. For $t = 0$ this construction reduces to the provious one in that $\eta(-,0) \colon X_{\beta +1 } \to X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta + 1}$ is the composite which we need to homotope to the identity; while $\eta(-,1)$ is the identity.
Since $\eta(-,t)$ is clearly also continuous in $t$ it constitutes a continuous function

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X_{\beta + 1}\times I \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}
$$

which exhibits the required left homotopy.


So far this shows that each stage $X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta+1}$ in the [[transfinite composition]] defining $\hat X$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]], hence, by prop.  \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

This means that all morphisms in the following diagram (notationally suppressing basepoints and showing only the finite stages)

$$
  \array{
    \pi_n(X)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_1)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_2)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_3)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \cdots
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow &
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & \cdots
    \\
    && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_\alpha \pi_n(X_\alpha)
  }
$$

are isomorphisms.

Moreover, lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} gives that every representative and every null homotopy of elements in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ already exists at some finite stage $X_k$. This means that also the universally induced morphism

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_\alpha \pi_n(X_\alpha)
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_n(\hat X)
$$

is an isomorphism. Hence the composite $\pi_n(X) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_n(\hat X)$ is an isomorphism.

=--





### Fibrations

Given a relative $C$-cell complex $\iota \colon  X \to Y$, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, it is typically interesting to study the [[extension]] problem along $f$, i.e. to ask which topological spaces $E$ are such that every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \longrightarrow E$ has an extension $\tilde f$ along $\iota$

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \tilde f}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If such extensions exists, it means that $E$ is sufficiently "spread out" with respect to the maps in $C$. More generally one considers this extension problem fiberwise, i.e. with both $E$ and $Y$ (hence also $X$) equipped with a map to some base space $B$:


+-- {: .num_defn #RightLiftingProperty}
###### Definition

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a sub-[[class]] $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]], then a morphism $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $C$ if every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{c}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,,
$$

with $c \in C$, has a [[lift]] $h$, in that it may be completed to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{c}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{h}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

We will also say that $f$ is a **$C$-[[injective morphism]]** if it satisfies the right lifting property against $C$.

###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$

hence if for every [[commuting diagram]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Def. \ref{SerreFibration} says, in view of the definition of [[left homotopy]], that a [[Serre fibration]] $p$ is a map with the property that given a [[left homotopy]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, between two functions into its [[codomain]], and given a lift of one the two functions through $p$, then also the homotopy between the two lifts.
Therefore the condition on a [[Serre fibration]] is also called the _[[homotopy lifting property]]_ for maps whose domain is an [[n-disk]].

More generally one may ask functions $p$ to have such [[homotopy lifting property]] for functions with arbitrary domain. These are called _[[Hurewicz fibrations]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #SerreFibrationsByLiftingAgainstMapsHomeomorphicToDiskInclusions}
###### Remark

The precise shape of $D^n$ and $D^n \times I$ in def. \ref{SerreFibration} turns out not to actually matter much for the nature of Serre fibrations. We will eventually find below (prop. \ref{LiftingPropertyInTheClassicalModelStructureOnTopologicalSpaces}) that what actually matters here is only that the inclusions $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ are [[relative cell complexes]] (lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes}) and [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}) and that all of these may be generated from them in a suitable way.

But for simple special cases this is readily seen directly, too. Notably we could replace the [[n-disks]] in def. \ref{SerreFibration} with any [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] topological space. A choice important in the comparison to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] ([below](#GeometricRealizationSection)) is to instead take the topological [[n-simplices]] $\Delta^n$. Hence a Serre fibration is equivalently characterized as having lifts in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta^n\times I &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Other deformations of the $n$-disks are useful in computations, too. For instance there is a homeomorphism from the $n$-disk to its "cylinder with interior and end removed", formally:

$$
  \array{
    (D^n \times \{0\})\cup (\partial D^n \times I) &\simeq& D^n
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n \times I &\simeq& D^n\times I
  }
$$

and hence $f$ is a Serre fibration equivalently also if it admits lifts in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    (D^n \times \{0\})\cup (\partial D^n \times I) &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n\times I &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.

The following statement is foreshadowing the [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] ([below](#LongSequences)) induced by any [[fiber sequence]], the full version of which we come to [below](HomotopyFiberSequences) (example \ref{LongExactSequeceOfHomotopyGroups}) after having developed more of the abstract homotopy theory.

+-- {: .num_prop #SerreFibrationGivesExactSequenceOfHomotopyGroups}
###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}, let $y \colon \ast \to Y$ be any point and write

$$
  F_y \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

for the [[fiber]] inclusion over that point. Then for every choice $x \colon \ast \to X$ of lift of the point $y$ through $f$, the induced sequence of [[homotopy groups]]

$$

  \pi_{\bullet}(F_y, x)
    \overset{\iota_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X, x)
    \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(Y)
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]], in that the [[kernel]] of $f_\ast$ is canonically identified with the [[image]] of $\iota_\ast$:

$$
  ker(f_\ast) \simeq im(\iota_\ast)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the image of $\iota_\ast$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$ (every sphere in $F_y\hookrightarrow X$ becomes constant on $y$, hence contractible, when sent forward to $Y$).

For the converse, let $[\alpha]\in \pi_{\bullet}(X,x)$ be represented by some $\alpha \colon S^{n-1} \to X$. Assume that $[\alpha]$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$. This means equivalently that $\alpha$ fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $\kappa$ is the contracting homotopy witnessing that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0$.

Now since $x$ is a lift of $y$, there exists a [[left homotopy]]

$$
  \eta  \;\colon\; \kappa \Rightarrow const_y
$$

as follows:

$$
  \array{
    && S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    && D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,\delta_1)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
$$

(for instance: regard $D^n$ as embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is identified with the basepoint on the boundary of $D^n$ and set $\eta(\vec v,t) \coloneqq \kappa(t \vec v)$).

The [[pasting]] of the top two squares that have appeared this way is equivalent to the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\downarrow
    &&
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1} \times I
      &\overset{(\iota_n, id)}{\longrightarrow}&
    D^n \times I
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Because $f$ is a [[Serre fibration]] and by lemma \ref{CylinderOverCWComplexIsJTopRelativeCellComplex} and prop. \ref{SerreFibrationHasRightLiftingAgainstJTopRelativeCellComplexes}, this has a [[lift]]

$$
  \tilde \eta \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \times I \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$


Notice that $\tilde \eta$ is a basepoint preserving [[left homotopy]] from $\alpha = \tilde \eta|_1$ to some $\alpha' \coloneqq \tilde \eta|_0$. Being homotopic, they represent the same element of $\pi_{n-1}(X,x)$:

$$
  [\alpha'] = [\alpha]
  \,.
$$

But the new representative $\alpha'$ has the special property that its image in $Y$ is not just trivializable, but trivialized:
combining $\tilde \eta$ with the previous diagram shows that it sits in the following commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \alpha' \colon & S^{n-1} &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& S^{n-1}\times I &\overset{\tilde \eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\iota_n} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\iota_n,id)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    & D^n &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    & \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The commutativity of the outer square says that $f_\ast \alpha'$ is constant, hence that $\alpha'$ is entirely contained in the fiber $F_y$. Said more abstractly, the [[universal property]] of [[fibers]] gives that $\alpha'$ factors through $F_y\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X$, hence that $[\alpha'] = [\alpha]$ is in the image of $\iota_\ast$.

The following lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}, together with lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} above, are the only two statements of the entire development here that crucially involve the [[concrete particular]] nature of [[topological spaces]] ("[[point-set topology]]"), everything beyond that is [[general abstract]] homotopy theory.

+-- {: .num_lemma #AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}
###### Lemma

The continuous functions with the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty} against the set $I_{Top} = \{S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow D^n\}$ of topological [[generating cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, are precisely those which are both [[weak homotopy equivalences]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces} as well as [[Serre fibrations]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We break this up into three sub-statements:

**A) $I_{Top}$-injective morphisms are in particular weak homotopy equivalences**

Let $p \colon \hat X \to X$ have the [[right lifting property]] against $I_{Top}$

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\longrightarrow & \hat X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$

We check that the lifts in these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as being an [[isomorphism]] on all [[homotopy groups]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}:


For $n = 0$ the existence of these lifts says that every point of $X$ is in the image of $p$, hence that $\pi_0(\hat X) \to \pi_0(X)$ is [[surjection|surjective]]. Let then $S^0 = \ast \coprod \ast \longrightarrow \hat X$ be a map that hits two connected components, then the existence of the lift says that if they have the same image in $\pi_0(X)$ then they were already the same connected component in $\hat X$. Hence $\pi_0(\hat X)\to \pi_0(X)$ is also [[injection|injective]] and hence is a [[bijection]].

Similarly, for $n \geq 1$, if $S^n \to \hat X$ represents an element in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ that becomes trivial in $\pi_n(X)$, then the existence of the lift says that it already represented the trivial element itself. Hence $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ has trivial [[kernel]] and so is injective.

Finally, to see that $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ is also surjective, hence bijective, observe that every elements in $\pi_n(X)$ is equivalently represented by a commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& \ast &\longrightarrow& \hat X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X &=& X
  }
$$

and so here the lift gives a representative of a preimage in $\pi_{n}(\hat X)$.

**B) $I_{Top}$-injective morphisms are in particular Serre fibrations**

By an immediate closure property of lifting problems (we spell this out in generality as prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} below) an $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphism]] has the [[right lifting property]] against all [[relative cell complexes]], and hence, by lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes}, it is also a $J_{Top}$-injective morphism, hence a Serre fibration.

**C) Acyclic Serre fibrations are in particular $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphisms]]**

([Hirschhorn 15, section 6](#Hirschhorn15)).

Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a Serre fibration that induces isomorphisms
on homotopy groups. In degree 0 this means that $f$ is an isomorphism on [[connected components]], and this means that there is a lift in every [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{-1} = \emptyset &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^0 = \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

(this is $\pi_0(f)$ being surjective) and in every commuting square of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^0  &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^1 = \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

(this is $\pi_0(f)$ being injective). Hence we are reduced to showing that for $n \geq 2$ every diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n  &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

has a lift.


To that end, pick a basepoint on $S^{n-1}$ and write $x$ and $y$ for its images in $X$ and $Y$, respectively

Then the diagram above expresses that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0 \in \pi_{n-1}(Y,y)$ and hence by assumption on $f$ it follows that $[\alpha] = 0 \in \pi_{n-1}(X,x)$, which in turn mean that there is $\kappa'$ making the upper triangle of our lifting problem commute:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n
  }
  \,.
$$

It is now sufficient to show that any such $\kappa'$ may be deformed to a $\rho'$ which keeps making this upper triangle commute but also makes the remaining lower triangle commute.

To that end, notice that by the commutativity of the original square, we already have at least this commuting square:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\iota_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \circ \kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n &\underset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This induces the universal map $(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')$ from the [[pushout]] of its [[cospan]] in the top left, which is the [[n-sphere]] (see [this](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself) example):

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\iota_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow
    &(po)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \circ \kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n &\underset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& S^n
    \\
    && & \searrow^{(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')}
    \\
    && && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This universal morphism represents an element of the $n$th homotopy group:

$$
  [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
   \in
  \pi_n(Y,y)
  \,.
$$

By assumption that $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, there is a $[\rho] \in \pi_{n}(X,x)$ with

$$
  f_\ast [\rho] = [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
$$

hence on representatives there is a lift up to homotopy

$$
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\nearrow_{\mathrlap{\Downarrow}} & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^n
    &\underset{(\kappa,f\circ \kappa')}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Morever, we may always find $\rho$ of the form $(\rho', \kappa')$ for some $\rho' \colon D^n \to X$. ("Paste $\kappa'$ to the reverse of $\rho$.")

Consider then the map

$$
  S^n \overset{(f\circ \rho', \kappa)}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

and observe that this represents the trivial class:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [(f \circ \rho', \kappa)]
    & =
    [(f\circ \rho', f\circ \kappa')]
     +
      [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = f_\ast \underset{= [\rho]}{\underbrace{[(\rho',\kappa')]}}
      +
        [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
      +
        [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that there is a homotopy

$$
  \phi \; \colon \; f\circ \rho' \Rightarrow \kappa
$$

fixing the boundary of the $n$-disk.

Hence if we denote homotopy by double arrows, then we have now achieved the following situation

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow
    &
      {}^{\rho'}\nearrow_{\Downarrow^{\phi}}
    &
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

and it now suffices to show that $\phi$ may be lifted to a homotopy of just $\rho'$, fixing the boundary, for then the resulting homotopic $\rho''$ is the desired lift.

To that end, notice that the condition that $\phi \colon D^n \times I \to Y$ fixes the boundary of the $n$-disk means equivalently that it extends to a morphism

$$
  S^{n-1} \underset{S^{n-1}\times I}{\sqcup} D^n \times I
  \overset{(f\circ \alpha,\phi)}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
$$

out of the [[pushout]] that identifies in the cylinder over $D^n$ all points lying over the boundary. Hence we are reduced to finding a lift in

$$
  \array{
    D^n &\overset{\rho'}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1}\underset{S^{n-1}\times I}{\sqcup} D^n \times I
    &\overset{(f\circ \alpha,\phi)}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

But inspection of the left map reveals that it is homeomorphic again to $D^n \to D^n \times I$, and hence the lift does indeed exist.

Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $I_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, hence just a plain relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, followed by an $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphisms]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

###### Proof

By lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
the set $J_{Top} = \{D^n \hookrightarrow D^n\times I\}$ of
topological [[generating acyclic cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, has small domains, in the sense of def. \ref{ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains} (the [[n-disks]] are [[compact topological space|compact]]). Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $J_{top}$-[[injective morphisms]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

By definition this makes $\hat X \to Y$ a [[Serre fibration]], hence a fibration.

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex. Hence $X \to \hat X$ is a classical cofibration. By lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} it is also a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], hence a clasical weak equivalence.

admits a [[lift]] as soon as one of the two is also a classical weak equivalence.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

**A)** If the fibration $f$ is also a weak equivalence, then lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} says that it has the right lifting property against the generating cofibrations $I_{Top}$, and cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies the claim.

**B)** If the cofibration $g$ on the left is also a weak equivalence, consider any factorization into a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a fibration,

$$
  g \;\colon\; \stackrel{\in J_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{\in Fib_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}
  \,,
$$

as in the proof of lemma \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}. By lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} the morphism $\overset{\in J_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, and so by [[two-out-of-three]] (prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree}) the factorizing fibration is actually an acyclic fibration. By case A), this acyclic fibration has the [[right lifting property]] against the cofibration $g$ itself, and so the [[retract argument]], lemma \ref{RetractArgument} gives that $g$  is a [[retract]] of a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex. With this, finally cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $g$.

=--

Finally:

+-- {: .num_prop #LiftingExhausted}
###### Proposition

The systems $(Cof_{cl} , W_{cl} \cap Fib_{cl})$ and $(W_{cl} \cap Cof_{cl}, Fib_{cl})$ from def. \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen} are [[weak factorization systems]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since we have already seen the factorization property (lemma \ref{FactorizationInTopQuillen}, lemma \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}) and the lifting properties (lemma \ref{LiftingPropertyInTheClassicalModelStructureOnTopologicalSpaces}), it only remains to see that the given left/right classes exhaust the class of morphisms with the given lifting property.

For the classical fibrations this is by definition, for the the classical acyclic fibrations this is by lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}.

The remaining statement for $Cof_{cl}$ and $W_{cl}\cap Cof_{cl}$ follows from a general argument ([here](cofibrantly+generated+model+category#RetractsOfCellComplexesExchaustLLPOfRLP)) for [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (def. \ref{CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory}), which we spell out:

So let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be in $(I_{Top} Inj) Proj$, we need to show that then $f$ is a retract (remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}) of a [[relative cell complex]]. To that end, apply the [[small object]] argument as in lemma \ref{FactorizationInTopQuillen} to factor $f$ as

$$
  f \;\colon \; X \overset{I_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow} \hat Y \overset{\in I_{Top} Inj}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

It follows that $f$ has the [[left lifting property]] against $\hat Y \to Y$, and hence by the [[retract argument]] (lemma \ref{RetractArgument}) it is a retract of $X \overset{I Cell}{\to} \hat Y$. This proves the claim for $Cof_{cl}$.

The analogous argument for $W_{cl} \cap Cof_{cl}$,  using the [[small object argument]] for $J_{Top}$, shows that every $f \in (J_{Top} Inj) Proj$ is a retract of a $J_{Top}$-cell complex. By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} and lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} a $J_{Top}$-cell complex is both an $I_{Top}$-cell complex and a weak homotopy equivalence. Retracts of the former are cofibrations by definition, and retracts of the latter are still weak homotopy equivalences by lemma \ref{RetractPreservesIsomorphism}. Hence such $f$ is an acyclic cofibration.

=--


In conclusion, prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree} and prop. \ref{LiftingExhausted} say that:

+-- {: .num_theorem #TopQuillenModelStructure}

* $Fib_{cl} = $ [[Serre fibrations]]

* $Cof_{cl} = $ [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]]

define a [[model category]] structure (def. \ref{ModelCategory}) $Top_{Quillen}$, the **[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]** or **Serre-Quillen model structure** .

In particular

1. every object in $Top_{Quillen}$ is fibrant;

1. the cofibrant objects in $Top_{Quillen}$ are the [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]].

+-- {: .num_cor #WhiteheadTheorem}
###### Corollary
**(Whitehead theorem)**

Every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}) between [[topological spaces]] that are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]], in particular to a [[CW-complex]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}), is a [[homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is the "Whitehead theorem in model categories", lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}, specialized to $Top_{Quillen}$ via theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}.

=--


In proving theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} we have in fact shown a bit more that stated. Looking back, all the structure of $Top_{Quillen}$ is entirely induced by the set $I_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}) of generating cofibrations and the set $J_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}) of generating acyclic cofibrations (whence the terminology). This situation is usefully summarized by the concept of _[[cofibrantly generated model category]]_ (Def. \ref{CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory}).

This phenomenon will keep recurring and will keep being useful as we construct further model categories, such as the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnPointedTopologicalSpaces}), the [[projective model structure on enriched functors|projective model structure on topological functors]] (thm. \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors}), and finally various [[model structures on spectra]] which we turn to in the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|section on stable homotopy theory]].

### The classical homotopy category
 {#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory}

With the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] in hand, we now have good control over the [[classical homotopy category]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClassicalHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition

The **Serre-Quillen [[classical homotopy category]]** is the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]], def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] $Top_{Quillen}$ from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}: we write

$$
  Ho(Top) \coloneqq Ho(Top_{Quillen})
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex}
###### Remark

From just theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, the definition \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} (def. \ref{ClassicalHomotopyCategory}) gives that

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}) \simeq (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
$$

is the category whose objects are [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}) and whose morphisms are [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]]. But in fact more is true:


Theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} in itself implies that every topological space is weakly equivalent to a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}. But by the existence of [[CW approximations]], this cell complex may even be taken to be a [[CW complex]].

(Better yet, there is [[Quillen equivalence]] to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] which implies a _functorial_ [[CW approximation]] ${\vert Sing X\vert} \overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow} X$
given by forming the [[geometric realization]] of the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$.)


Hence  the Serre-Quillen [[classical homotopy category]] is also equivalently the category of just the [[CW-complexes]] whith [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] between them

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Ho(Top_{Quillen}) & \simeq (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
    \\
    & \simeq (Top_{CW})/_{\sim}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

It follows that the [[universal property]] of the homotopy category (theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory})

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}) \simeq Top[W_{cl}^{-1}]
$$

implies that there is a bijection, up to [[natural isomorphism]], between

1. functors out of $Top_{CW}$ which agree on homotopy-equivalent maps;

1. functors out of all of $Top$ which send weak homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms.

This statement in particular serves to show that two different axiomatizations of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories are equivalent to each other. See at _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- S]]_ the section _[generalized cohomology functors](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors)_ ([this prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent))

**Beware** that, by remark \ref{NotEveryHomotopyEquivalenceIsAWeakHomotopyEquivalence}, what is **not** equivalent to $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$ is the category

$$
  hTop \coloneqq Top/_\sim
$$

obtained from _all_ topological spaces with morphisms the homotopy classes of continuous functions. This category is "too large", the correct homotopy category is just the genuine [[full subcategory]]

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen})
   \simeq
  (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
   \simeq
  Top/_\sim
    =
  \hookrightarrow hTop
  \,.
$$

Beware also the ambiguity of terminology: "classical homotopy category" some literature refers to $hTop$ instead of $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$. However, here we never have any use for $hTop$ and will not mention it again.

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalCylinderOnCWComplexIsGoodCylinderObject}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[CW-complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}. Then the standard topological cylinder of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}

$$
  X \sqcup X
   \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow}
  X\times I
   \longrightarrow
  X
$$

(obtained by forming the [[product space]] with the standard [[topological interval]] $I = [0,1]$) is indeed a _[[cylinder object]]_ in the abstract sense of def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We describe the proof informally. It is immediate how to turn this into a formal proof, but the notation becomes tedious. (One place where it is spelled out completely is [Ottina 14, prop. 2.9](cylinder+object#Ottina14).)

So let $X_0 \to X_1 \to X_2\to \cdots \to X$ be a presentation of $X$ as a CW-complex. Proceed by induction on the cell dimension.

First observe that the cylinder $X_0 \times I$ over $X_0$ is a cell complex: First $X_0$ itself is a disjoint union of points. Adding a second copy for every point (i.e. [[attaching space|attaching]] along $S^{-1}\to D^0$) yields $X_0 \sqcup X_0$, then attaching an inteval between any two corresponding points (along $S^0 \to D^1$) yields $X_0 \times I$.

So assume that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ it has been shown that $X_n \times I$ has the structure of a CW-complex of dimension $(n+1)$. Then for each cell of $X_{n+1}$, attach it _twice_ to $X_n \times I$, once at $X_n \times \{0\}$, and once at $X_n \times \{1\}$.

The result is $X_{n+1}$ with a _hollow cylinder_ erected over each of its $(n+1)$-cells. Now fill these hollow cylinders (along $S^{n+1} \to D^{n+1}$) to obtain $X_{n+1}\times I$.

This completes the induction, hence the proof of the CW-structure on $X\times I$.

The construction also manifestly exhibits the inclusion $X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow}$ as a [[relative cell complex]].

Finally, it is clear (prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}) that $X \times I \to X$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

Conversely:

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be any [[topological space]]. Then the standard topological [[path space object]] (def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace})

$$
  X
    \longrightarrow
  X^I
    \overset{(X^{\delta_0}, X^{\delta_1})}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times X
$$

(obtained by forming the [[mapping space]], def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}, with the standard [[topological interval]] $I = [0,1]$) is indeed a _[[path space object]]_ in the abstract sense of def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $const \colon X\to X^I$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] it is sufficient, by prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, to exhibit a [[homotopy equivalence]]. Let the homotopy inverse be $X^{\delta_0} \colon X^I \to X$. Then the composite

$$
  X \overset{const}{\longrightarrow} X^I \overset{X^{\delta_0}}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

is already equal to the identity. The other we round, the rescaling of paths provides the required homotopy

$$
  \array{
    I \times X^I &\overset{(t,\gamma)\mapsto \gamma(t\cdot(-))}{\longrightarrow}&
    X^I
  }
  \,.
$$


To see that $X^I \to X\times X$ is a fibration, we need to show that every commuting square of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X^I
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& X \times X
  }
$$

has a lift.

Now first use the [[adjunction]] $(I \times (-))\dashv (-)^I$ from prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} to rewrite this equivalently as the following commuting square:

$$
  \array{
    D^n \sqcup D^n
      &\overset{(i_0, i_0)}{\longrightarrow}&
    (D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_0, i_1)}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& X
  }
  \,.
$$

This square is equivalently (example \ref{PushoutInTop}) a morphism out of the [[pushout]]

$$
  D^n \times I
    \underset{D^n \sqcup D^n }{\sqcup}
  \left((D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)\right)
  \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

By the same reasoning, a lift in the original diagram is now equivalently a lifting in

$$
  \array{
    D^n \times I
      \underset{D^n \sqcup D^n }{\sqcup}
    \left((D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)\right)
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (D^n \times I)\times I &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

Inspection of the component maps shows that the left vertical morphism here is the inclusion into the square times $D^n$ of three of its faces times $D^n$. This is homeomorphic to the inclusion $D^{n+1} \to D^{n+1} \times I$ (as in remark \ref{SerreFibrationsByLiftingAgainstMapsHomeomorphicToDiskInclusions}). Therefore a lift in this square exsists, and hence a lift in the original square exists.

### Model structure on pointed spaces
 {#ModelstructureOnPointedTopologicalSpaces}

A _[[pointed object]]_ $(X,x)$ is of course an [[object]] $X$ equipped with a [[point]] $x \colon \ast \to X$, and a morphism of pointed objects $(X,x) \longrightarrow (Y,y)$ is a morphism $X \longrightarrow Y$ that takes $x$ to $y$. Trivial as this is in itself, it is good to record some basic facts, which we do here.

Passing to pointed objects is also the first step in linearizing classical homotopy theory to [[stable homotopy theory]]. In particular, every category of pointed objects has a [[zero object]], hence has [[zero morphisms]]. And crucially, if the original category had [[Cartesian products]], then its pointed objects canonically inherit a non-cartesian [[tensor product]]: the [[smash product]]. These ingredients will be key below in the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|section on stable homotopy theory]].

In this situation one says that $\ast$ is a _[[zero object]]_ and that $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ is a _[[pointed category]]_.

It follows that also all [[hom-sets]] $Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}}(X,Y)$ of $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ are canonically [[pointed sets]], pointed by the _[[zero morphism]]_

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] with all [[limits]] and [[colimits]]. Then also the [[category of pointed objects]] $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$, def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, has all limits and colimits.

Moreover:

1. the limits are the limits of the underlying diagrams in $\mathcal{C}$, with the base point of the limit induced by its universal property in $\mathcal{C}$;

1. the colimits are the limits in $\mathcal{C}$ of the diagrams _with the basepoint adjoined_.

###### Example

Given two pointed objects $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$, then:

1. their [[product]] in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ is simply $(X\times Y, (x,y))$;

1. their [[coproduct]] in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ has to be computed using the second clause in prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects}: since the point $\ast$ has to be adjoined to the diagram, it is given not by the coproduct in $\mathcal{C}$, but by the [[pushout]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form:

   $$
     \array{
       \ast &\overset{x}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{y}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
       \\
       Y &\longrightarrow& X \vee Y
     }
     \,.
   $$

   This is called the _[[wedge sum]]_ operation on pointed objects.

Generally for a set $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ in $Top^{\ast/}$

1. their [[product]] is formed in $Top$ as in example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}, with the new basepoint canonically induced;

1. their [[coproduct]] is formed by the [[colimit]] in $Top$ over the diagram with a basepoint adjoined, and is called the [[wedge sum]] $\vee_{i \in I} X_i$.

In particular this may happen for $\mathcal{C} = $ [[Top]].

A sufficient condition for $(-) \times Z$ to preserve quotients is that it is a [[left adjoint]] functor. This is the case in the smaller subcategory of [[compactly generated topological spaces]], we come to this in prop. \ref{SmashProductInTopcgIsAssociative} below.

$$
  X \wedge (I_+) = (X \times I)/(\{x_0\} \times I)

is the **[[reduced cylinder]]** over $X$: the result of forming the ordinary cyclinder over $X$ as in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, and then identifying the interval over the basepoint of $X$ with the point.

(Generally, any construction in $\mathcal{C}$ properly adapted to pointed objects $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ is called the "reduced" version of the unpointed construction. Notably so for "[[reduced suspension]]" which we come to [below](#MappingCones).)


Just like the ordinary cylinder $X\times I$ receives a canonical injection from the [[coproduct]] $X \sqcup X$ formed in $Top$, so the reduced cyclinder receives a canonical injection from the coproduct $X \sqcup X$ formed in $Top^{\ast/}$, which is the [[wedge sum]] from example \ref{WedgeSumAsCoproduct}:

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] and let $X \in \mathcal{C}$ be an [[object]]. Then both the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ as well as the [[coslice category]] $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$, def. \ref{SliceCategory}, carry model structures themselves -- the **[[model structure on a slice category|model structure on a (co-)slice category]]**,  where a morphism is a weak equivalence, fibration or cofibration iff its image under the [[forgetful functor]] $U$ is so in $\mathcal{C}$.

In particular the category $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ of [[pointed objects]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, in a model category $\mathcal{C}$ becomes itself a model category this way.

The corresponding [[homotopy category of a model category]], def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, we call the **[[pointed category|pointed]] [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]]** $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is immediate:

By prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects} the (co-)slice category has all limits and colimits. By definition of the weak equivalences in the (co-)slice, they satisfy [[two-out-of-three]], def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}, because the do in $\mathcal{C}$.

Similarly, the factorization and lifting is all induced by $\mathcal{C}$: Consider the coslice category $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$, the case of the slice category is formally dual; then if

$$
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    A && \underset{f}{\longrightarrow} && B
  }
$$

commutes in $\mathcal{C}$, and a factorization of $f$ exists in $\mathcal{C}$, it uniquely makes this diagram commute

$$
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & \swarrow &\downarrow& \searrow
    \\
    A &\longrightarrow& C & \longrightarrow& B
  }

$$

Similarly, if

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& C
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& D
  }
$$

is a [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$, hence a commuting diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ as shown, with all objects equipped with compatible morphisms from $X$, then inspection shows that any lift in the diagram necessarily respects the maps from $X$, too.

### Model structure on compactly generated spaces
 {#ModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}

The category [[Top]] has the technical inconvenience that [[mapping spaces]] $X^Y$ (def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}) satisfying the exponential property (prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}) exist in general only for $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]], but fail to exist more generally. In other words: [[Top]] is not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. But cartesian closure is necessary for some purposes of homotopy theory, for instance it ensures that

1. the [[smash product]] (def. \ref{SmashProductOfPointedObjects}) on [[pointed topological spaces]] is [[associative]] (prop. \ref{SmashProductInTopcgIsAssociative} below);

1. there is a concept of [[topologically enriched functors]] with values in topological spaces, to which we turn [below](#ModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors);

1. [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] preserves [[products]].

The first two of these are crucial for the development of [[stable homotopy theory]] in the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|next section]], the third is a great convenience in computations.

Now, since the [[homotopy theory]] of topological spaces only cares about the [[CW approximation]] to any topological space (remark \ref{EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex}), it is plausible to ask for a [[full subcategory]] of [[Top]] which still contains all [[CW-complexes]], still has all [[limits]] and [[colimits]], still supports a model category structure constructed in the same way as above, but which in addition is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], and preferably such that the model structure interacts well with the cartesian closure.

Such a full subcategory exists, the category of [[compactly generated topological spaces]]. This we briefly describe now.

###### Proof

We need to show that for $A \subset X$ a $k$-closed subset, then the [[preimage]] $f^{-1}(A) \subset X$ is closed subset.

Let $\phi \colon K \longrightarrow X$ be any continuous function out of a compact Hausdorff space $K$. Since $A$ is $k$-closed by assumption, we have that $(f \circ \phi)^{-1}(A) = \phi^{-1}(f^{-1}(A))\subset K$ is closed in $K$. This means that $f^{-1}(A)$ is $k$-closed in $X$. But by the assumption that $X$ is compactly generated, it follows that $f^{-1}(A)$ is already closed.

+-- {: .num_cor #kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory}
###### Corollary

For $X \in Top_{cg}$ there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(X,Y) \simeq Hom_{Top_{cg}}(X, k(Y))
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that the functor $k$ (def. \ref{kfication}) together with the inclusion from def. \ref{kTop} forms an pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  Top_{cg}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{k}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\hookrightarrow}
      {\bot}
  Top
  \,.
$$

This in turn means equivalently that $Top_{cg} \hookrightarrow Top$ is a [[coreflective subcategory]] with coreflector $k$. In particular $k$ is [[idempotent monad|idemotent]] in that there are [[natural isomorphisms|natural]] [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  k(k(X))\simeq k(X)
  \,.
$$

Hence [[colimits]] in $Top_{cg}$ exists and are computed as in [[Top]]. Also [[limits]] in $Top_{cg}$ exists, these are obtained by computing the limit in [[Top]] and then applying the functor $k$ to the result.

If $Y$ is (compactly generated and) a [[Hausdorff space]], then the topology on the compactly generated mapping space $X^Y$ in def. \ref{CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces} agrees with the [[compact-open topology]] of def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}. Beware that it is common to say "compact-open topology" also for the topology of the compactly generated mapping space when $Y$ is not Hausdorff. In that case, however, the two definitions in general disagree.

###### Proposition

The category $Top_{cg}$ of def. \ref{kTop} is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]:

for every $X \in Top_{cg}$ then the operation $X\times (-) \times (-)\times X$ of forming the [[Cartesian product]] in $Top_{cg}$ (which by cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory} is $k$ applied to the usual [[product topological space]]) together with the operation $(-)^X$ of forming the compactly generated [[mapping space]] (def. \ref{CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces}) forms a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

+-- {: .num_cor #MappingSpacesSendsColimitsInFirstArgumentToLimits}
###### Corollary

For $I$ a [[small category]] and $X_\bullet \colon I \to Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ a [[diagram]], then the compactly generated [[mapping space]] construction from def. \ref{CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces} preserves [[limits]] in its covariant argument and sends colimits in its contravariant argument to limits:

$$
  Maps(X,\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i Y_i)_\ast
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i Maps(X, Y_i)_\ast
$$

and

$$
  Maps( \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i, \; Y )_\ast
  \simeq
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
  Maps( X_i, Y )_\ast
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is an immediate implication of $Maps(X,-)_\ast$ being a [[right adjoint]], according to cor. \ref{SmashHomAdjunctionOnPointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}.

For the second statement, we use that by def. \ref{kTop} a [[compactly generated topological space]] is uniquely determined if one knows all continuous functions out of compact Hausdorff spaces into it. Hence it is sufficient to show that there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  Hom_{Top_{cg}^{\ast/}}\left( K,\;
    Maps( \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i, \; Y )_\ast
  \right)
  \simeq
  Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}\left( K, \;
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
    Maps( X_i, Y )_\ast
  \right)
$$

for $K$ any compact Hausdorff space.

With this, the statement follows by cor. \ref{SmashHomAdjunctionOnPointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces} and using that ordinary [[hom-sets]] take colimits in the first argument and limits in the second argument to limits:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}
    \left(
      K, \; Maps(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i,\; Y)_\ast
    \right)
    & \simeq
    Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}
    \left(
      K \wedge \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i,\; Y
    \right)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}
    \left(
      \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i
      (K \wedge X_i)
      ,\; Y
    \right)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
    \left(
      Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}
      ( K \wedge X_i, \; Y )
    \right)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
    Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}( K, \; Maps(X_i,Y)_\ast )
    \\

    Hom_{Top^{\ast/}_{cg}}
    \left(
      K,\;

$$

is [[associativity|associative]] and the [[0-sphere]] is a [[tensor unit]] for it.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $(-)\times X$ is a [[left adjoint]] by prop. \ref{CartesianClosureOfTopcg}, it presevers [[colimits]] and in particular [[quotient space]] projections. Therefore with $X, Y, Z \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ then

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (X \wedge Y) \wedge Z
    & =
    \frac{
      \frac{X\times Y}{X \times\{y\} \sqcup \{x\}\times Y}
      \times Z
    }{ (X \wedge Y)\times \{z\} \sqcup \{[x] = [y]\} \times Z}
    \\
    & \simeq
    \frac{\frac{X \times Y \times Z}{X \times \{y\}\times Z \sqcup \{x\}\times Y \times Z}}{
      X \times Y \times \{z\}
    }
   \\
   &\simeq
    \frac{X\times Y \times Z}{ X \vee Y \vee Z}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The analogous reasoning applies to yield also $X \wedge (Y\wedge Z) \simeq \frac{X\times Y \times Z}{ X \vee Y \vee Z}$.

The second statement follows directly with prop. \ref{CartesianClosureOfTopcg}.

+-- {: .num_remark #PointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpacesIsSymmetricMonoidalClosed}
###### Remark

Corollary \ref{SmashHomAdjunctionOnPointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces} together with prop. \ref{SmashProductInTopcgIsAssociative} says that under the [[smash product]] the category of [[pointed topological spaces|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]] is a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] with [[tensor unit]] the [[0-sphere]].

$$
  (Top_{cg}^{\ast/}, \wedge, S^0)
  ,.
$$

Notice that by prop. \ref{CartesianClosureOfTopcg} also unpointed compactly generated spaces under [[Cartesian product]] form a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], hence a [[cartesian closed category]]

$$
  (Top_{cg}, \times , \ast)
  \,.
$$

The fact that $Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ is still closed symmetric monoidal but no longer Cartesian exhibits $Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ as being "more [[linear logic|linear]]" than $Top_{cg}$. The "full linearization" of $Top_{cg}$ is the closed symmteric monoidal category of [[structured spectra]] under [[smash product of spectra]]
which we discuss in [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|section 1]].

=--

Due to the [[idempotent monad|idempotency]] $k \circ k \simeq k$ (cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory}) it is useful to know plenty of conditions under which a given topological space is already compactly generated, for then applying $k$ to it does not change it and one may continue working as in $Top$.

###### Example

Every [[CW-complex]] is [[compactly generated topological space|compactly generated]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since [[a CW-complex is a Hausdorff space]], by prop. \ref{HausdorffImpliessWeaklyHausdorff} and  prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfCompactClosedSetsInWeaklyHausdorffSpace} its $k$-closed subsets are precisely those whose intersection with every [[compact subspace]] is closed.

Since a CW-complex $X$ is a [[colimit]] in [[Top]] over attachments of standard [[n-disks]] $D^{n_i}$ (its cells), by the characterization of colimits in $Top$ ([prop.](Top#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop)) a subset of $X$ is open or closed precisely if its restriction to each cell is open or closed, respectively. Since the $n$-disks are compact, this implies one direction: if a subset $A$ of $X$ intersected with all compact subsets is closed, then $A$ is closed.

For the converse direction, since [[a CW-complex is a Hausdorff space]] and since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]], the intersection of a closed subset with a compact subset is closed.

+-- {: .num_theorem #ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}
###### Theorem

The restriction of the [[model category]] structure on $Top_{Quillen}$ from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} along the inclusion $Top_{cg} \hookrightarrow Top$ of def. \ref{kTop} is still a model category structure, which is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] by the same sets $I_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}) and $J_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}) The coreflection of cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory} is a  [[Quillen equivalence]] (def. \ref{QuillenEquivalence})

      {\hookrightarrow}
      {\bot}
  Top_{Quillen}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By example \ref{CWComplexIsCompactlyGenerated}, the sets $I_{Top}$ and $J_{Top}$ are indeed in $Mor(Top_{cg})$. By example \ref{ProductOfCWWithLocallyCompactCWIsCompactlyGenerated} all arguments above about left homotopies between maps out of these basic cells go through verbatim in $Top_{cg}$. Hence the three technical lemmas above depending on actual [[point-set topology]],  topology, lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}, lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} and lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}, go through verbatim as before. Accordingly, since the remainder of the proof of theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} of $Top_{Quillen}$ follows by general abstract arguments from these, it also still goes through verbatim for $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ (repeatedly use the [[small object argument]] and the [[retract argument]] to establish the two weak factorization systems).

Hence the (acyclic) cofibrations in $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ are identified with those in $Top_{Quillen}$, and so the inclusion is a part of a [[Quillen adjunction]] (def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction}). To see that this is a [[Quillen equivalence]] (def. \ref{QuillenEquivalence}), it is sufficient to check that for $X$ a compactly generated space then a continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}) precisely if the [[adjunct]] $\tilde f \colon X \to k(Y)$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. But, by lemma \ref{ContinuousFunctionsOutOfCompactlyGeneratedFactorThroughCompactlyGeneratedClosureOfCodomain}, $\tilde f$ is the same function as $f$, just considered with different codomain. Hence the result follows with prop. \ref{kificationComparisonIsWeakHomotopyEquivalence}.

**Compactly generated weakly Hausdorff topological spaces**


While the inclusion $Top_{cg} \hookrightarrow Top$ of def. \ref{kTop} does satisfy the requirement that it gives a [[cartesian closed category]] with all [[limits]] and [[colimits]] and containing all [[CW-complexes]], one may ask for yet smaller subcategories that still share all these properties but potentially exhibit further convenient properties still.

A popular choice introduced in ([McCord 69](weakly+Hausdorff+topological+space#McCord69)) is to add the further restriction to topopological spaces which are not only compactly generated but also [[weakly Hausdorff topological space|weakly Hausdorff]]. This was motivated from ([Steenrod 67](compactly+generated+topological+space#Steenrod67)) where compactly generated Hausdorff spaces were used by the observation (([McCord 69, section 2](weakly+Hausdorff+topological+space#McCord69))) that Hausdorffness is not preserved my many colimit operations, notably not by forming [[quotient spaces]].

On the other hand, in above we wouldn't have imposed Hausdorffness in the first place. More intrinsic advantages of $Top_{cgwH}$ over $Top_{cg}$ are the following:

* every [[pushout]] of a morphism in $Top_{cgwH} \hookrightarrow Top$ along a [[closed subspace]] inclusion in $Top$ is again in $Top_{cgwH}$

* in $Top_{cgwH}$ quotient spaces are not only preserved by [[cartesian products]] (as is the case for all compactly generated spaces due to $X\times (-)$ being a left adjoint, according to cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory}) but by all [[pullbacks]]

* in $Top_{cgwH}$ the [[regular monomorphisms]] are the [[closed subspace]] inclusions

So far the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] which we established in theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, as well as the [[projective model structure on functors|projective model structures on topologically enriched functors]] induced from it in theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors}, concern the [[hom-sets]], but not the [[hom-spaces]] (def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}), i.e. the model structure so far has not been related to the topology on [[hom-spaces]]. The following statements say that in fact the model structure and the enrichment by topology on the hom-spaces are compatible in a suitable sense: we have an "[[enriched model category]]". This implies in particular that the product/hom-adjunctions are [[Quillen adjunctions]], which is crucial for a decent discusson of the derived functors of the suspension/looping adjunction [below](#TheSuspensionLoopingDiscussion).

###### Proof

To see this, it is profitable to model [[n-disks]] and [[n-spheres]], up to [[homeomorphism]], as $n$-cubes $D^\n \simeq [0,1]^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and their boundaries $S^{n-1} \simeq \partial [0,1]^n$ . For the idea of the proof, consider the situation in low dimensions, where one readily sees pictorially that

$$
  i_1 \Box i_1
  \;\colon\;
    \left(\;\; = \;\;\cup\;\; \vert\vert\;\;\right)
    \hookrightarrow
    \Box
$$

and

$$
  i_1 \Box j_0
  \;\colon\;
    \left(\;\; = \;\;\cup\;\; \vert \;\; \right)
    \hookrightarrow
    \Box
  \,.
$$

Generally, $D^n$ may be represented as the space of $n$-tuples of elements in $[0,1]$, and $S^n$ as the suspace of tuples for which at least one of the coordinates is equal to 0 or to 1.

Accordingly, $S^{n_1} \times D^{n_2} \hookrightarrow D^{n_1 + n_2}$ is the subspace of $(n_1+n_2)$-tuples, such that at least one of the first $n_1$ coordinates is equal to 0 or 1, while $D^{n_1} \times S^{n_2} \hookrightarrow D^{n_1+ n_2}$ is the subspace of $(n_1 + n_2)$-tuples such that east least one of the last $n_2$ coordinates is equal to 0 or to 1. Therefore

$$
  S^{n_1} \times D^{n_2} \cup D^{n_1} \times S^{n_2} \simeq S^{n_1 + n_2}
  \,.
$$

And of course it is clear that $D^{n_1} \times D^{n_2} \simeq D^{n_1 + n_2}$. This shows the first case.

For the second, use that $S^{n_1} \times D^{n_2} \times I$ is contractible to $S^{n_1} \times D^{n_2}$ in $D^{n_1} \times D^{n_2} \times I$, and that $S^{n_1} \times D^{n_2}$ is a subspace of $D^{n_1} \times D^{n_2}$.

###### Proposition

Let $i_1, i_2 , p$ be three morphisms in $Top_{cg}$, def. \ref{kTop}. Then for their [[pushout-products]] (def. \ref{PushoutProduct}) and pullback-powerings (def. \ref{PullbackPowering}) the following [[lifting properties]] are equivalent ("[[Joyal-Tierney calculus]]"):

$$
  \array{
    &  i_1 \Box i_2 & \text{has LLP against} & p
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow & i_1 &  \text{has LLP against} & p^{\Box i_2}
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow & i_2 &  \text{has LLP against} & p^{\Box i_1}
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We claim that by the [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closure]] of $Top_{cg}$, and carefully collecting terms, one finds a natural bijection between [[commuting squares]] and their [[lifts]] as follows:

$$
  \array{
    Q &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& X^B
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_1}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p^{\Box i_2}}}
    \\
    P &\underset{(g_1,g_2)}{\longrightarrow}& Y^B \underset{Y^A}{\times} X^A
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;

    \\
    P \times B & \underset{\tilde g_1}{\longrightarrow} & Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where the tilde denotes product/hom-[[adjuncts]], for instance

$$
  \frac{
    P \overset{g_1}{\longrightarrow} Y^B
  }{
    P \times B \overset{\tilde g_1}{\longrightarrow} Y
  }
$$

etc.

To see this in more detail, observe that both squares above each represent two squares from the two components into the fiber product and out of the pushout, respectively, as well as one more square exhibiting the compatibility condition on these components:

###### Remark

In [[model category]] theory the property in proposition \ref{PushoutProductInTopCGSendsCofCofToCof} is referred to as saying that the model category $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ from theorem \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces} 

1. is a [[monoidal model category]] with respect to the [[Cartesian product]] on $Top_{cg}$;

1. is an [[enriched model category]], over itself.

A key point of what this entails is the following:

For $X \in (Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ cofibrant (a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]]) then the product-hom-adjunction for $Y$ (prop. \ref{CartesianClosureOfTopcg}) is a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$

By example \ref{PushoutProductWithInitialMorphism} we have that the [[left adjoint]] functor is equivalently the [[pushout product]] functor with the initial morphism of $X$:

$$
  X \times (-)
  \simeq
  (\emptyset \to X) \Box (-)

By assumption $(\emptyset \to X)$ is a cofibration, and hence prop. \ref{PushoutProductInTopCGSendsCofCofToCof} says that this is a left Quillen functor.

For $X \in (Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$ cofibrant with respect to the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces|classical model structure on pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]] (theorem \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}, prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) (hence a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]] with non-degenerate basepoint, remark \ref{NonDegenerateBasepointAsCofibrantObjects}) then the pointed product-hom-adjunction from corollary \ref{SmashHomAdjunctionOnPointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}  is a [[Quillen adjunction]] (def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction}):

###### Proof

Let now $\Box_\wedge$ denote the **smash pushout product** and $(-)^{\Box(-)}$ the **smash pullback powering** defined as in def. \ref{PushoutProduct} and def. \ref{PullbackPowering}, but with [[Cartesian product]] replaced by [[smash product]] (def. \ref{SmashProductOfPointedObjects}) and compactly generated [[mapping space]] replaced by pointed mapping spaces (def. \ref{PointedMappingSpace}).

By theorem \ref{CofibrantGenerationOfPointedTopologicalSpaces} $(Top_{cg}^{\ast/})_{Quillen}$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] by $I_{Top^{\ast/}} = (I_{Top})_+$ and $J_{Top^{\ast/}}= (J_{Top})_+$. Example \ref{WedgeAndSmashOfBasePointAdjoinedTopologicalSpaces} gives that for $i_n \in I_{Top}$ and $j_n \in J_{Top}$ then

$$
  (i_{n_1})_+ \Box_\wedge (i_{n_2})_+ \simeq (i_{n_1 + n_2})_+
$$

and

$$
  (i_{n_1})_+ \wedge_\wedge (i_{n_2})_+ \simeq (i_{n_1 + n_2})_+

$$

Hence the pointed analog of prop. \ref{PushoutProductInTopCGSendsCofCofToCof} holds and therefore so does the pointed analog of the conclusion in prop. \ref{HomProductAdjunctionForCofibrantObjectInTopCGIsQuillen}.

### Model structure on topological functors
 {#ModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors}

With classical topological homotopy theory in hand (theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, theorem \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}), it is straightforward now to generalize this to a homotopy theory of _topological diagrams_. This is going to be the basis for the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]], because spectra may be identified with certain topological diagrams ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-1#SequentialSpectraAsDiagramSpectra)).

Technically, "topological diagram" here means "[[Top]]-[[enriched functor]]". We now discuss what this means and then observe that as an immediate corollary of theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} we obtain a model category structure on topological diagrams.

As a by-product, we obtain the model category theory of [[homotopy colimits]] in topological spaces, which will be useful.

In the following we say _[[Top]]-[[enriched category]]_ and _[[Top]]-[[enriched functor]]_ etc. for what often is referred to as "[[topological category]]" and "[[topological functor]]" etc. As discussed there, these latter terms are ambiguous.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopEnrichedCategory}
###### Definition

A **[[topologically enriched category]]** $\mathcal{C}$ is a $Top_{cg}$-[[enriched category]], hence:

1. a [[class]] $Obj(\mathcal{C})$, called the **class of [[objects]]**;

1. for each $a, b\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a [[compactly generated topological space]] (def. \ref{kTop})

   $$
     \mathcal{C}(a,b)\in Top_{cg}
     \,,
   $$

   called the **space of [[morphisms]]** or the **[[hom-space]]** between $a$ and $b$;

1. for each $a,b,c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a [[continuous function]]

   $$
     \circ_{a,b,c} \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(a,b)\times \mathcal{C}(b,c) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}(a,c)
   $$

   out of the [[cartesian product]] (by cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory}: the image under $k$ of the [[product topological space]]), called the _[[composition]]_ operation;

1. for each $a \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a point $Id_a\in \mathcal{C}(a,a)$, called the _[[identity]]_ morphism on $a$

such that the composition is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]].

Similarly a **pointed topologically enriched category** is such a structure with $Top_{cg}$ replaced by $Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ (def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}) and with the [[Cartesian product]] replaced by the [[smash product]] (def. \ref{SmashProductOfPointedObjects}) of pointed topological spaces.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #UnderlyingCategoryOfTopEnrichedCategory}
###### Remark

Given a (pointed) [[topologically enriched category]] as in def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}, then forgetting the topology on the [[hom-spaces]] (along the [[forgetful functor]] $U \colon Top_{cg} \to Set$) yields an ordinary [[locally small category]] with

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(a,b) = U(\mathcal{C}(a,b))
  \,.
$$

It is in this sense that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category with [[extra structure]], and hence "[[enriched category|enriched]]".

$$

1. a [[function]]

   $$
     F_0 \;\colon\; Obj(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow Obj(\mathcal{D})

   of [[hom-spaces]],

such that this preserves [[composition]] and [[identity]] morphisms in the evident sense.

A [[homomorphism]] of topologically enriched functors

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; F \Rightarrow G
$$

is a $Top_{cg}$-[[enriched natural transformation]]: for each $c \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a choice of morphism $\eta_c \in \mathcal{D}(F(c),G(c))$ such that for each pair of objects $c,d \in \mathcal{C}$ the two continuous functions

to the archetypical topologically enriched category from example \ref{TopkAsATopologicallyEnrichedCategory} may be thought of as a topologically enriched [[copresheaf]], at least if $\mathcal{C}$ is [[small category|small]] (in that its [[class]] of objects is a proper [[set]]).

Hence the category of topologically enriched functors

$$
  [\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]

according to def. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor} may be thought of as the ([[copresheaf|co-]])[[presheaf category]] over $\mathcal{C}$ in the realm of topological enriched categories.

A functor $F \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]$ is equivalently

1. a [[compactly generated topological space]] $F_a \in Top_{cg}$ for each object $a \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$;

###### Proof

First consider the underlying diagram of functors $F_i^\circ$ where the topology on the [[hom-spaces]] of $\mathcal{C}$ and of $Top_{cg}$ has been forgotten. Then one finds

$$
  (\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i F^\circ_i)(c) \simeq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i (F^\circ_i(c)) \;\;\in Set

and

$$
  (\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i F^\circ _i)(c) \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i (F^\circ_i(c)) \;\; \in Set
$$

by the [[universal property]] of limits and colimits. (Given a morphism of diagrams then a unique compatible morphism between their limits or colimits, respectively, is induced as the universal factorization of the morphism of diagrams regarded as a cone or cocone, respectvely, over the codomain or domain diagram, respectively).

Hence it only remains to see that equipped with topology, these limits and colimits in $Set$ become limits and colimits in $Top_{cg}$. That is just the statement of prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} with corollary \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory}.

###### Proposition
**(topologically enriched Yoneda-lemma)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[topologically enriched category]], def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}, write $[\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]$ for its category of topologically enriched (co-)presheaves, and for $c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ write $y(c) = \mathcal{C}(c,-) \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$ for the topologically enriched functor that it represents, all according to example \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctorsToTopk}. Recall the [[tensoring]] operation $(F,X) \mapsto F \cdot X$ from def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfTopologicallyEnrichedCopresheaves}.

For $c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$, $X \in Top_{cg}$ and $F \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]$, there is a [[natural bijection]] between

1. morphisms $y(c) \cdot X \longrightarrow F$ in $[\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]$;

1. morphisms $X \longrightarrow F(c)$ in $Top_{cg}$.

In short:

$$
  \frac{
    y(c)\cdot X \longrightarrow F
  }{
    X \longrightarrow F(c)
  }
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a morphism $\eta \colon y(c) \cdot X \longrightarrow F$ consider its component

$$
  \eta_c \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,c)\times X \longrightarrow F(c)
$$

and restrict that to the identity morphism $id_c \in \mathcal{C}(c,c)$ in the first argument

$$
  \eta_c(id_c,-) \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow F(c)
  \,.
$$

We claim that just this $\eta_c(id_c,-)$ already uniquely determines all components

$$
  \eta_d \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,d)\times X \longrightarrow F(d)
$$

of $\eta$, for all $d \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$: By definition of the transformation $\eta$ (def. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor}), the two functions

$$
   F(-) \circ \eta_c
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(c,d)
  \longrightarrow
  F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

and

$$
  \eta_d  \circ \mathcal{C}(c,-) \times X
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(c,d)
  \longrightarrow
  F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

agree. This means (remark \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedNaturalTransformationIsTransformationOfUnderlyingFunctors}) that they may be thought of jointly as a function with values in commuting squares in $Top_{cg}$ of this form:

$$
  f
  \;\;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    \mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& F(c)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mathcal{C}(c,f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}}
    \\
    \mathcal{C}(c,d) \times X &\underset{\eta_d}{\longrightarrow}& F(d)
  }
$$

For any $f \in \mathcal{C}(c,d)$, consider the restriction of

$$
  \eta_d \circ \mathcal{C}(c,f) \in F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

to $id_c \in \mathcal{C}(c,c)$, hence restricting the above commuting squares to

$$
  f
  \;\;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    \{id_c\} \times X &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& F(c)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mathcal{C}(c,f)}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}}
    \\
    \{f\} \times X &\underset{\eta_d}{\longrightarrow}& F(d)
  }
$$

This shows that $\eta_d$ is fixed to be the function

$$
  \eta_d(f,x) = F(f)\circ \eta_c(id_c,x)
$$

and this is a continuous function since all the operations it is built from are continuous.

Conversely, given a continuous function $\alpha \colon X \longrightarrow F(c)$, define for each $d$ the function

$$
  \eta_d \colon (f,x) \mapsto F(f) \circ \alpha
  \,.
$$

Running the above analysis backwards shows that this determines a transformation $\eta \colon y(c)\times X \to F$.

###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInTheProjectiveModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors} constitute a [[model category]] structure on $[\mathcal{C}, Top_{cg}]$ and $[\mathcal{C}, Top^{\ast/}_{cg}]$, called the **[[projective model structure on enriched functors]]**

=--

([Piacenza 91, theorem 5.4](#Piacenza91))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedCopresheavesHaveAllLimitsAndColimits} the category has all limits and colimits, hence it remains to check the model structure

But via the enriched Yoneda lemma (prop. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedYonedaLemma}) it follows that proving the model structure reduces objectwise to the proof of theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, theorem \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces}.
In particular, the technical lemmas \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}, \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} and \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} generalize immediately to the present situation, with the evident small change of wording:

For instance, the fact that a morphism of topologically enriched functors $\eta \colon F \to G$ that has the right lifting property against the elements of $I_{Top}^{\mathcal{C}}$ is a projective weak equivalence, follows by noticing that for fixed $\eta \colon F \to G$ the [[enriched Yoneda lemma]] prop. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedYonedaLemma} gives a [[natural bijection]] of commuting diagrams (and their fillers) of the form

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    y(c) \cdot S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& F
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id\cdot \iota_n)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}
    \\
    y(c) \cdot D^n &\longrightarrow& G
  }
  \right)
  \;\;\;\leftrightarrow\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& F(c)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta_c}}
     \\
     D^n &\longrightarrow& G(c)
  }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

and hence the statement follows with part A) of the proof of lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}.

With these three lemmas in hand, the remaining formal part of the proof goes through verbatim as [above](#VerificationOfTopQuillen): repeatedly use the [[small object argument]] (prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}) and the [[retract argument]] (prop. \ref{RetractArgument}) to establish the two [[weak factorization systems]]. (While again the structure of a [[category with weak equivalences]] is evident.)

+-- {: .num_example #PreExcisiveFunctors}
###### Example

Given examples \ref{TopkAsATopologicallyEnrichedCategory} and \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctorsToTopk}, the next evident example of a pointed [[topologically enriched category]] besides $Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ itself is the functor category

$$
  [Top_{cg}^{\ast/}, Top_{cg}^{\ast/}]
  \,.
$$

The only technical problem with this is that $Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ is not a [[small category]] (it has a [[proper class]] of objects), which means that the existence of all limits and colimits via prop. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedCopresheavesHaveAllLimitsAndColimits} may (and does) fail.

But so we just restrict to a small topologically enriched subcategory. A good choice is the [[full subcategory]]

$$
  Top^{\ast/}_{cg,fin} \hookrightarrow Top^{\ast/}_{cg}
$$

of topological spaces homoemorphic to [[finite CW-complexes]]. The resulting projective model category (via theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors})

$$
  [Top_{cg,fin}^{\ast/}\;,\; (Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}]_{proj}
$$

is also also known as the **strict [[model structure for excisive functors]]**. (This terminology is the special case for $n = 1$ of the terminology "[[n-excisive functors]]" as used in "[[Goodwillie calculus]]", a homotopy-theoretic analog of [[differential calculus]].)  After enlarging its class of weak equivalences while keeping the cofibrations fixed, this will become [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to a [[model structure for spectra]]. This we discuss in [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1-2|part 1.2]], in the section [on pre-excisive functors](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#OnPreExcisiveFunctors).

=--


One consequence of theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors} is the model category theoretic incarnation of the theory of _[[homotopy colimits]]_.

Observe that ordinary [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (def. \ref{Limits}) are equivalently characterized in terms of [[adjoint functors]]:

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any [[category]] and let $I$ be a [[small category]]. Write $[I,\mathcal{C}]$ for the corresponding [[functor category]]. We may think of its objects as $I$-shaped [[diagrams]] in $\mathcal{C}$, and of its morphisms as homomorphisms of these diagrams.  There is a canonical functor

$$
  const_I
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C} \overset{}{\longrightarrow} [I,\mathcal{C}]
$$

which sends each object of $\mathcal{C}$ to the diagram that is constant on this object. Inspection of the definition of the [[universal properties]] of [[limits]] and [[colimits]] on one hand, and of [[left adjoint]] and [[right adjoint]] functors on the other hand, shows that

1. precisely when $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[colimits]] of shape $I$, then the functor $const_I$ has a [[left adjoint]] functor, which is the operation of forming these colimits:

   $$
     [I,\mathcal{C}]
       \underoverset
        {\underset{const_I}{\longleftarrow}}
        {\overset{\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_I}{\longrightarrow}}

is just a plain functor and is equivalently a sequence of [[continuous functions]] (morphisms in $Top_{cg}$) of the form (also called a _[[cotower]]_)

 X_2

It is immediate to check that those sequences $X_\bullet$ which are cofibrant in the projective model structure (theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors}) are precisely those for which

1. all component morphisms $f_i$ are cofibrations in $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ or $(Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$, respectively, hence [[retracts]] (remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}) of [[relative cell complex]] inclusions (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex});

1. the object $X_0$, and hence all other objects, are cofibrant, hence are [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}).

By example \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnNSequencesOfTopologicalSpaces} it is immediate that the operation of forming colimits sends projective (acyclic) cofibrations between sequences of topological spaces to (acyclic) cofibrations in the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]]. On those projectively cofibrant sequences where every map is not just a [[retract]] of a [[relative cell complex]] inclusion, but a plain relative cell complex inclusion, more is true:

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Use that both $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ and $(Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$ are [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (theorem \ref{CofibrantGenerationOfPointedTopologicalSpaces}) whose generating acyclic cofibrations have [[compact topological spaces]] as [[domains]] and [[codomains]]. The colimit over a sequence of relative cell complexes (being a [[transfinite composition]]) yields another [[relative cell complex]], and hence lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} says that every morphism out of the domain or codomain of a generating acyclic cofibration into this colimit factors through a finite stage inclusion. Since a projective fibration is a degreewise fibration, we have the [[lifting property]] at that finite stage, and hence also the lifting property against the morphisms of colimits.

Regarding the second statement:

This is a model category theoretic version of a standard fact of plain [[category theory]], which says that in the category [[Set]] of sets, [filtered colimits commute with finite limits](commutativity+of+limits+and+colimits#FilteredColimitsCommuteWithFiniteLimits) in that there is an isomorphism of sets of the form which we have to prove is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces. But now using that weak homotopy equivalences are detected by forming [[homotopy groups]] (def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}), hence [[hom-sets]] out of [[n-spheres]], and since $n$-[[spheres]] are [[compact topological spaces]], lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} says that homming out of $n$-spheres commutes over the colimits in question. Moreover, generally homming out of anything commutes over [[limits]], in particular [[finite limits]] (every [[hom functor]] is [[left exact functor]] in the second variable). Therefore we find isomorphisms of the form

$$
  Hom\left(
    S^q,
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
      \left(
        \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
        D_n(i)
      \right)
  \right)
  \simeq
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
      \left(
        \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
        Hom\left(S^q, D_n(i)\right)
      \right)
   \overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
      \left(
        \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
        Hom\left(S^q D_n(i)\right)
      \right)
   \simeq
    Hom\left(
     S^q,
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
      \left(
        \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
          D_n(i)
      \right)
   \right)
$$

and similarly for the [[left homotopies]] $Hom(S^q \times I,-)$ (and similarly for the pointed case). This implies the claimed isomorphism on homotopy groups.

## $\infty$-Groupoids II): Simplicial homotopy theory

With [[groupoids]] and [[chain complexes]] we have seen two kinds of objects which support concepts of [[homotopy theory]], such as a concept of [[homotopy equivalence]] between them ([[equivalence of groupoids]] on the one hand, and [[quasi-isomorphism]] on the other). In some sense these two cases are opposite extremes in the more general context of [[homotopy theory]]:

* [[chain complexes]] have homotopical structure (e.g. [[chain homology]]) in arbitrary high degree, i.e. they may be [[homotopy n-types]] for arbitrary $n$, but they are fully _abelian_ in that there is never any [[nonabelian group]] structure in a chain complex, not is there any non-trivial [[action]] of the homology groups of a chain complex on each other;

* [[groupoids]] have more general non-abelian structure, for every ([[nonabelian group|nonabelian]]) [[group]] there is a groupoid which has this as its [[fundamental group]], but this fundamental group (in degree 1) is already the highest homotopical structure they carry, groupoids are necessarily [[homotopy 1-types]].

On the other hand, both groupoids and chain complexes naturally have incarnations in the joint context of _[[simplicial sets]]_. We now discuss how their common joint generalization is given by those simplicial sets whose simplices have a sensible notion of composition and inverses, the _[[Kan complexes]]_.

Kan complexes serve as a standard powerful model on which the complete formulation of [[homotopy theory]] (without geometry) may be formulated.


### Simplicial sets

The concept of [[simplicial sets]] is secretly well familiar already in basic [[algebraic topology]]: it reflects just the abstract structure carried by the [[singular simplicial complexes]] of [[topological spaces]], as in the definition of [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]. 

Conversely, every simplicial set may be [[geometric realization|geometrically realized]] as a topological space. These two [[adjoint]] operations turn out to exhibit the homotopy theory of simplicial sets as being equivalent ([[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]]) to the homotopy theory of topological spaces.  For some purposes, working in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is preferable over working with topological homotopy theory.

(graphics taken from [Friedman 08](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplicial+set#Friedman08))

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$
  s_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\sigma_k,X) : (Sing X)_{n} \to (Sing X)_{n+1}
$$

that regard an $n$-simplex as beign a degenerate ("thin") $(n+1)$-simplex.
All these sets of simplices and face and degeneracy maps between them form the following structure. 

+-- {: .num_defn #sSet}
###### Definition
**([[simplicial sets]])**

A **[[simplicial set]]** $S$ is 

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[set]] $S_n \in Set$ -- the **set of $n$-[[simplices]]**;

* for each [[injective map]] $\delta_i : \overline{n-1} \to \overline{n}$ of [[nLab:totally ordered sets]] $\bar n \coloneqq \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n \}$

  a [[function]] $d_i : S_{n} \to S_{n-1}$ -- the $i$th **face map** on $n$-simplices;

* for each [[surjective map]] $\sigma_i : \overline{n+1} \to \bar n$ of [[totally ordered sets]]

  a [[function]] $\sigma_i : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}$ -- the $i$th **degeneracy map** on $n$-simplices;

such that these functions satisfy the following identities, called the_[[simplicial identities]]_:

1. $ d_i \circ d_j  = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ if $i \lt j$,

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

1. $d_i \circ s_j =  \left\{ \array{ s_{j-1} \circ d_i &  if \;  i \lt j \\ id & if  \;  i = j \; or \; i = j+1 \\ s_j \circ d_{i-1} &  if i \gt j+1 } \right. $

For $S, T$ two simplicial sets, a [[morphism]] of simplicial sets $S \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} T$ is for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[function]] $S_N \overset{f_n}{\longrightarrow} T_n$ between sets of $n$-simplices, such that these functions are compatible with all the face and degeneracy maps.

This defines a [[category]] (Def. \ref{Categories}) [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]].

=--

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplexCategory}
###### Definition
**([[simplex category]])**

The **[[simplex category]]** $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the free categories of the form

$$

    [0] & \coloneqq \{0\}
    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}

###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\
     & \nearrow && \searrow

**([[simplicial sets]] are [[presheaves]] on the [[simplex category]])**

A [[functor]] 

$$
  S \;\colon\; \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

from the [[opposite category]] (Example \ref{OppositeCategory}) of the [[simplex category]] (Def. \ref{SimplexCategory}) to the [[category of sets]], hence a [[presheaf]] on $\Delta$ (Example \ref{CategoryOfPresheaves}), is canonically identified with a [[simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}.

Via this identification, the [[category]] [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]] (Def. \ref{sSet}) is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[category of presheaves]] on the [[simplex category]]

$$
  sSet
  \;=\;
  [\Delta^{op}, Set]
  \,.

In particular this means that [[sSet]] is a [[cosmos]] for [[enriched category theory]] (Example \ref{ExamplesOfCosmoi}), by Prop. \ref{PropertiesOfSheafToposes}.

###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the [[simplicial identities]] 
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

This makes the following evident:

$$

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[nLab:hom functor]] of [[nLab:Top]]:

###### Remark 

It turns out -- this is the content of the _[[nLab:homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_ ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)) -- that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$. Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]]. We come to this below.

}).

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; f \Rightarrow g

between two morphisms

$$
  f,g\;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y

of [[simplicial sets]] is a morphism 

$$

such that the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]

$$
  \array{

For $Y$ a [[Kan complex]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}, its _simplicial [[path space object]]_ is the [[function complex]] $X^{\Delta[1]}$ (formed in the [[category]] [[sSet]], Prop. \ref{SimplicialSetsAsPresheavesOnTheSimplexCategory}).

The the basic invariants of [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] are their [[simplicial homotopy groups]], to which we turn now.
 
Given that a [[Kan complex]] is a special [[simplicial set]] that [[homotopy hypothesis|behaves like]] a combinatorial model for a [[topological space]], the _simplicial homotopy groups_ of a  Kan complex are accordingly the combinatorial analog of the [[homotopy groups]] of [[topological spaces]]: instead of being maps from topological [[spheres]] modulo maps from topological disks, they are maps from the [[boundary of a simplex]] modulo those from the [[simplex]] itself. 

Accordingly, the definition of the discussion of simplicial homotopy groups is essentially literally the same as that of [[homotopy groups]] of topological spaces.  One technical difference is for instance that the definition of the group structure is slightly more non-immediate for simplicial homotopy groups than for topological homotopy groups (see below).


+-- {: .num_defn #UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}

$$
  \pi_0(X) \colon X_0/X_1

For $x \in X_0$ a vertex and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, then the underlying [[set]]  of the **$n$th [[simplicial homotopy group]]** of $X$ at $x$ -- denoted $\pi_n(X,x)$ -- is, the set of [[equivalence classes]] $[\alpha]$ of morphisms

$$

from the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ to $X$, such that these take the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary of the simplex]] to $x$, i.e. such that they fit into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form

where two such maps $\alpha, \alpha'$ are taken to be equivalent is they are related by a [[simplicial homotopy]] $\eta$

that fixes the boundary in that it fits into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form

$$

     &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

These sets are taken to be equipped with the following group structure.

+-- {: .num_defn #ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups}
###### Definition 
  
For $X$ a [[Kan complex]], for $x\in X_0$, for $n \geq 1$ and for  $f,g \colon \Delta[n] \to X$ two representatives of $\pi_n(X,x)$ as in def. \ref{UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}, consider the following $n$-simplices in $X_n$:

$$
  v_i 
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      s_0 \circ s_0 \circ \cdots \circ s_0 (x) & for \; 0 \leq i \leq  n-2
      \\
      f & for \; i = n-1
      \\
      g & for \; i = n+1
    }
  \right.
$$

This corresponds to a morphism $\Lambda^{n+1}[n] \to X$ from a [[horn]] of the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] into $X$. By the [[Kan complex]] property of $X$ this morphism has an [[extension]] $\theta$ through the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^{n+1}[n] & \longrightarrow & X
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta}}
     \\
     \Delta[n+1]
  }
$$

From the [[simplicial identities]] one finds that the boundary of the $n$-simplex arising as the $n$th boundary piece $d_n \theta$ of $\theta$ is constant on $x$

$$
  d_i d_{n} \theta = d_{n-1} d_i \theta = x
$$

So $d_n \theta$ represents an element in $\pi_n(X,x)$ and we define a product operation on $\pi_n(X,x)$ by

$$
  [f]\cdot [g] \coloneqq [d_n \theta]

All the degenerate $n$-simplices $v_{0 \leq i \leq n-2}$ in def. \ref{ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups} are just there so that the gluing of the two $n$-cells $f$ and $g$ to each other can be regarded as forming the boundary of an $(n+1)$-simplex except for one face.

For each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, the **$(n,i)$-horn** or **$(n,i)$-box**
is the subsimplicial set

$$
  \Lambda^i[n]
  \hookrightarrow
  \Delta[n]
$$

which is the [[union]] of all faces _except_ the  $i^{th}$ one.

This is called an **outer horn** if $k = 0$ or $k = n$.  Otherwise it is an **inner horn**.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


Since [[sSet]]  is a [[presheaf topos]], [[unions]] of [[subobjects]] make sense and they are calculated objectwise, thus in this case dimensionwise.  This way it becomes clear what the structure of a horn as a functor $\Lambda^k[n]: \Delta^{op} \to Set$ must therefore be: it takes $[m]$ to the collection of ordinal maps $f: [m] \to [n]$ which do not have the element $k$ in the image.

The inner horn, def. \ref{SimplicialHorn} of the [[simplex|2-simplex]]

$$\partial \Delta^2 =   \left\{
      \array{

$$

The two outer horns look like

$$\Lambda^2_0 =

**([[Kan complex]])**

A _[[Kan complex]]_ is a [[simplicial set]] $S$ that satisfies the _Kan condition_,

* which says that all [[horns]] of the simplicial set have _fillers_/extend to [[simplices]];

* which means equivalently that the unique homomorphism $S \to pt$ from $S$ to the [[point]] (the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[simplicial set]]) is a [[Kan fibration]];

* which means equivalently that for all [[diagrams]] in [[sSet]] of the form

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its [[singular simplicial complex]]
$Sing(X)$, def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}, is a Kan complex, def. \ref{KanComplexes}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to
  {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k)
  =
  Id
  \,.
$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

The proof uses the basic tool of [[nerve and realization]]-[[adjunction]] to which we get to below in prop. \ref{NerveAndRealizationAdjunction}.

###### Proof

First observe that the left [[lifting property]] against all $C \hookrightarrow C \times I$ for $C$ a [[CW-complex]] is equivalent to left lifting against [[geometric realization]] ${\vert \Lambda^i[n]\vert} \hookrightarrow {\vert \Delta[n]\vert}$ of [[horn]] inclusions.
Then apply the [[natural isomorphism]] $Top({\vert-\vert},-) \simeq sSet(-,Sing(-))$,  given by the [[adjunction]] of prop. \ref{NerveAndRealizationAdjunction} and example \ref{TopologicalRealizationOfSimplicialSets}, to the lifting diagrams.

Let $p \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[Kan fibration]], def. \ref{KanFibration}, and let $f_1,f_2 \colon A \longrightarrow X$ be two morphisms. If there is a [[left homotopy]] (def. \ref{LeftHomotopyOfSimplicialSets}) $f_1 \Rightarrow f_2$ between these maps, then there is a fiberwise [[homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, between the [[pullback]] fibrations $f_1^\ast X \simeq f_2^\ast X$.

While [[simplicial sets]] have the advantage of being purely combinatorial structures, the [[singular simplicial complex]] of any given [[topological space]], def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex} is in general a huge simplicial set which does not lend itself to detailed inspection.

A [[Kan fibration]] $\phi \colon S \longrightarrow T$, def. \ref{KanFibration}, is called a **[[minimal Kan fibration]]** if for any two cells in the same fiber with the same [[boundary]] if they are homotopic relative their boundary, then they are already equal.

More formally, $\phi$ is minimal precisely if for every [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{

###### Proof

By assumption of the base being connected, the classifying maps for the fibers over any two vertices are connected by a [[zig-zag]] of [[homotopies]], hence by lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} the fibers are connected by [[homotopy equivalences]] and then by prop. \ref{PullbackPreservesMinimalFibration} and lemma \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} they are already isomorphic. Write $F$ for this [[typical fiber]].

Moreover, for all $n$ the morphisms $\Delta[n] \to \Delta[0] \to \Delta[n]$ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to $\Delta[n] \stackrel{id}{\to} \Delta[n]$ and so applying lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} and prop. \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} once more yields that the fiber over each $\Delta[n]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\Delta[n]\times F$.

 The statement of prop. \ref{DiscreteGroupoidIsDijointUnioonOfDeloopings}
 becomes false as when we pass to groupoids that are equipped with
 [[geometry|geometric]] structure. This is the reason why for discrete geometry all  [[Chern-Simons theory|Chern-Simons]]-type field theories (namely [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]-type theories) fundamentally involve just groups (and higher groups),
 while for nontrivial geometry there are genuine groupoid theories,
 for instance the [[AKSZ sigma-models]]. But even so,
 [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is usefully discussed in terms of groupoid technology, in particular since the choice of equivalence in

the [[loop space object|loop space groupoid]] of $X$.

For $G$ a group and $\mathbf{B}G$ its  [[delooping]] groupoid from

  $$
    G \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}G = \ast \underset{\mathbf{B}G}{\times} \ast

We are to compute the ordinary limiting cone $\ast \underset{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}{\times}  (\mathbf{B}G^I)_\bullet \underset{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}{\times} \ast$ in

$$

In the middle we have the groupoid $(\mathbf{B}G)^I_\bullet$ whose objects are elements of $G$ and whose morphisms starting at some element are labeled by pairs of elements $h_1, h_2 \in G$ and end at $h_1 \cdot g \cdot h_2$.
Using remark \ref{FiberProductsOfGroupoidsComponentwise}
the limiting cone is seen to precisely pick those morphisms in $(\mathbf{B}G_\bullet)^I_\bullet$ such that these two elements are constant on the neutral element $h_1 = h_2 = e = id_{\ast}$, hence it produces just the elements of $G$ regarded as a groupoid with only identity morphisms, as in example \ref{SetAsGroupoid}.

The [[free loop space object]] is

	\simeq
	X \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X]}{\times}X
  $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that $\Pi_1(S^0) \simeq \ast \coprod \ast$. Therefore
the [[path space object]] $[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet$ has

* objects are pairs of morphisms in $X_\bullet$;

* morphisms are commuting squares of such.

Now the fiber product in def. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductOfGroupoids}
picks in there those pairs of morphisms for which both start at the same object, and both end at the same object. Therefore $X_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} [\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} X$ is the groupoid whose

* objects are diagrams in $X_\bullet$ of the form

  $$
    \array{

       \\
       x_0 && x_1
       \\
       & \searrow \nearrow
    }
  $$

* morphism are cylinder-diagrams over these.

One finds along the lines of example
\ref{BZIsPiSOne} that this is equivalent to maps from $\Pi_1(S^1)$ into $X_\bullet$ and homotopies between these.

Even though all these models of the circle $\Pi_1(S^1)$ are equivalent,
below the special appearance of the circle in the proof of

$$
  \mathbf{B}c \;\colon\; \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}\flat U(1)
  \,.
$$

Under the [[free loop space object]] construction this becomes

  \;\colon\;
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}G]

In the familiar construction of [[singular homology]] recalled [above](#SimplicialHomology) one constructs the _alternating face map chain complex_ of the [[simplicial abelian group]] of singular simplices, def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}. This construction is natural and straightforward, but the result chain complex tends to be very "large" even if its [[chain homology groups]] end up being very "small". But in the context of [[homotopy theory]] one is to consider all objects notup to [[isomorphism]], but of to [[weak equivalence]], which for [[chain complexes]] means up to _[[quasi-isomorphisms]]_. Hence one should look for the natural construction of "smaller" chain complexes that are still quasi-isomorphic to these alternating face map complexes.

Given a [[simplicial abelian group]] $A$, then the projection [[chain map]]

$$
  (C A) \longrightarrow (C A)/(D A)
$$

from its alternating face maps complex, def. \ref{AlternatingFaceMapComplex}, to the alternating face map complex modulo degeneracies, def. \ref{ComplexModuloDegeneracies}, is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the pre-composition of the map with the inclusion of the
normalized chain complex, def. \ref{NormalizedChainComplexOnGeneralGroup}.

$$
  \array{
    C A &\stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow}& (C A)/(D A)

By theorem \ref{EMTheorem} the vertical map is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] and by prop. \ref{NormalizedIntoModuloDegeneraciesIsIsomorpism} the composite diagonal map is an [[isomorphism]], hence in particular also a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. Since quasi-isomorphisms satisfy the [[two-out-of-three]] property, it follows that also the map in question is a quasi-isomorphism.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ChainsOnThe1Simplex}
###### Example

Consider the 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta[1]$ regarded as a [[simplicial set]], and write $\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]$ for the [[simplicial abelian group]] which in each degree is the [[free abelian group]] on the simplices in $\Delta[1]$.

This simplicial abelian group starts out as

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]
  =
  \left(
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
     \mathbb{Z}^4 \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
     \mathbb{Z}^3 \stackrel{\overset{\partial_0}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\partial_1}{\longrightarrow}} \mathbb{Z}^2
  \right)
$$

(where we are indicating only the face maps for notational simplicity).

Here the first $\mathbb{Z}^2 = \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}$, the [[direct sum]] of two copies of the [[integers]], is the group of 0-chains generated from the two endpoints $(0)$ and $(1)$ of $\Delta[1]$, i.e. the abelian group of formal linear combinations of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z}^2 \simeq \left\{ a \cdot (0) + b \cdot (1) | a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
  \,.
$$

The second $\mathbb{Z}^3 \simeq \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}$ is the abelian group generated from the three (!) 1-simplicies in $\Delta[1]$, namely the non-degenerate edge $(0\to 1)$ and the two degenerate cells $(0 \to 0)$ and $(1 \to 1)$, hence the abelian group of formal linear combinations of the form

$$
  \mathbb{Z}^3 \simeq \left\{ a \cdot (0\to 0) + b \cdot (0 \to 1) + c \cdot (1 \to 1) | a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
  \,.
$$

The two face maps act on the basis 1-cells as

$$
  \partial_1 \colon (i \to j) \mapsto (i)
$$

$$
  \partial_0 \colon (i \to j) \mapsto (j)
  \,.
$$

Now of course most of the (infinitely!) many simplices inside $\Delta[1]$ are degenerate. In fact the only non-degenerate simplices are the two 0-cells $(0)$ and $(1)$ and the 1-cell $(0 \to 1)$. Hence the alternating face maps complex modulo degeneracies, def. \ref{ComplexModuloDegeneracies}, of $\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]$ is simply this:

$$
  (C (\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]])) / D (\mathbb{Z}[\Delta[1]]))
  =
  \left(
    \cdots
    \to
    0
    \to
    0
    \to
    \mathbb{Z}
    \stackrel{\left(1 \atop -1\right)}{\longrightarrow}
    \mathbb{Z}^2
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice that alternatively we could consider the topological 1-simplex $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$ and its [[singular simplicial complex]] $Sing(\Delta^1)$ in place of the smaller $\Delta[1]$, then the free simplicial abelian group $\mathbb{Z}(Sing(\Delta^1))$ of that. The corresponding alternating face map chain complex $C(\mathbb{Z}(Sing(\Delta^1)))$ is "huge" in that in each positive degree it has a free abelian group on uncountably many generators. Quotienting out the degenerate cells still leaves uncountably many generators in each positive degree (while every singular $n$-simplex in $[0,1]$ is "thin", only those whose parameterization is as induced by a degeneracy map are actually regarded as degenerate cells here). Hence even after normalization the singular simplicial chain complex is "huge". Nevertheless it is quasi-isomorphic to the tiny chain complex found above.

This is due to ([Moore, 1954](simplicial+group#Moore54))

In fact, not only are the [[horn]] fillers guaranteed to exist, but there is an algorithm that provides explicit fillers.  This implies that constructions on a simplicial group that use fillers of horns can often be adjusted to be functorial by using the algorithmically defined fillers.  An argument that just uses 'existence' of fillers can be refined to give something more 'coherent'.


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $G$ be a simplicial group.

Here is the explicit algorithm that computes the horn fillers:

Let $(y_0,\ldots, y_{k-1}, -,y_{k+1}, \ldots, y_n)$ give a [[horn]] in $G_{n-1}$, so the $y_i$s are $(n-1)$ simplices that fit together as if they were all but one, the $k^{th}$ one,  of the faces of an $n$-simplex. There are three cases:

1. if $k = 0$:

   * Let  $w_n = s_{n-1}y_n$ and then $w_i = w_{i+1}(s_{i-1}d_i w_{i+1})^{-1}s_{i-1}y_i$ for  $i = n, \ldots, 1$, then  $w_1 $ satisfies $d_i w_1 = y_i$, $i\neq  0$;

1. if $0\lt k \lt n$:

   * Let $w_0 = s_0 y_0$ and $w_i = w_{i-1}(s_i d_i w_{i-1})^{-1}s_i y_i$ for $i = 0, \ldots, k-1$, then take $w_n = w_{k-1}(s_{n-1}d_nw_{k-1})^{-1}s_{n-1}y_n$, and finally a downwards induction given by $w_i = w_{i+1}(s_{i-1}d_{i}w_{i+1})^{-1}s_{i-1}y_i$, for $i = n, \ldots, k+1$, then $w_{k+1}$ gives $d_{i}w_{k+1} = y_i$ for $i \neq k$;


3. if $k=n$:

   * use $w_0 = s_0 y_0$ and $w_i = w_{i-1}(s_i d_i w_{i-1})^{-1}s_i y_i$ for $i = 0, \ldots, n-1$, then $w_{n-1}$ satisfies $d_i w_{n-1} = y_i$, $i\neq n$.

### Geometric realization

So far we we have considered passing from [[topological spaces]] to [[simplicial sets]] by applying the [[singular simplicial complex]] functor of def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.
Now we discuss a [[left adjoint]] of this functor, called [[geometric realization]], which turns a simplicial set into a topological space by identifying each of its abstract [[n-simplices]] with the standard topological $n$-simplex. 

This is an example of a general abstract phenomenon:

Thus for a topological space $X$ the [[adjunction counit]] $\epsilon_X \colon {\vert Sing X\vert} \longrightarrow X$ of the [[nerve and realization]]-adjunction is a candidate for a replacement of $X$ by a CW-complex. For this, $\epsilon_X$ should be at least a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], i.e. induce [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy groups]]. Since homotopy groups are built from maps into $X$ out of [[compact topological spaces]] it is plausible that this works if the topology of $X$ is entirely detected by maps out of compact topological spaces into $X$.

###### Proposition

The **acyclic fibrations** in $sSet_{Quillen}$(i.e. the maps that are both fibrations as well as weak equivalences) between [[Kan complexes]] are precisely the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ that have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ of boundaries of $n$-simplices into their $n$-simplices
  $$
    \array{
      \partial \Delta[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.

###### Proposition

$sSet_{Quillen}$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with

* generating cofibrations the [[boundary]] inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$;

* generating acyclic cofibrations the [[horn]] inclusions $\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$.

###### Theorem

Let $W$ be the smallest class of morphisms in $sSet$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. The class of monomorphisms that are in $W$ is closed under [[pushout]], [[transfinite composition]], and [[retracts]].
2. $W$ has the [[two-out-of-three]] property in $sSet$ and contains all the [[isomorphisms]].
3. For all natural numbers $n$, the unique morphism $\Delta [n] \to \Delta [0]$ is in $W$.

Then $W$ is the class of weak homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

* First, notice that the horn inclusions $\Lambda^0 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ and $\Lambda^1 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ are in $W$.
* Suppose that the horn inclusion $\Lambda^k [m] \hookrightarrow \Delta [m]$ is in $W$ for all $m \lt n$ and all $0 \le k \le m$. Then for $0 \le l \le n$, the horn inclusion $\Lambda^l [n] \hookrightarrow \Delta [n]$ is also in $W$.
* Quillen's [[small object argument]] then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in $W$.
* If $p : X \to Y$ is a trivial Kan fibration, then its right lifting property implies there is a morphism $s : Y \to X$ such that $p \circ s = id_Y$, and the two-out-of-three property implies $s : Y \to X$ is a trivial cofibration. Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in $W$.
* Every weak homotopy equivalence factors as $p \circ i$ where $p$ is a trivial Kan fibration and $i$ is a trivial cofibration, so every weak homotopy equivalence is indeed in $W$.
* Finally, noting that the class of weak homotopy equivalences satisfies the conditions in the theorem, we deduce that it is the _smallest_ such class.

As a corollary, we deduce that the classical model structure on $sSet$ is the smallest (in terms of weak equivalences) model structure for which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the weak equivalences include the (combinatorial) homotopy equivalences.

###### Proposition

Let $\pi_0 : sSet \to Set$ be the connected components functor, i.e. the left adjoint of the constant functor $cst : Set \to sSet$. A morphism $f : Z \to W$ in $sSet$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map
$$\pi_0 K^f : \pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$$
is a bijection for all _Kan complexes_ $K$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One direction is easy: if $K$ is a [[Kan complex]], then axiomS FOR [[simplicial model categories]] (Def. \ref{SimplicialModelCategory}) implies  the functor $K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to sSet$ is a [[right Quillen functor]], so [[Ken Brown's lemma]] (Prop. \ref{KenBrownLemma})  implies that it preserves all weak homotopy equivalences; in particular, $\pi_0 K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to Set$ sends weak homotopy equivalences to bijections.

Conversely, when $K$ is a Kan complex, there is a natural bijection between $\pi_0 K^X$ and the hom-set $Ho (sSet) (X, K)$, and thus by the [[Yoneda lemma]], a morphism $f : Z \to W$ such that the induced morphism $\pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$ is a bijection for all Kan complexes $K$ is precisely a morphism that becomes an isomorphism in $Ho (sSet)$, i.e. a weak homotopy equivalence.

###### Theorem
**([[Quillen equivalence]] between [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] and [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]])**

The [[singular simplicial complex]]/[[geometric realization]]-[[nerve and realization|adjunction]] of example \ref{TopologicalRealizationOfSimplicialSets}
constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] $sSet_{Quillen}$ of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOnsSetQuillen} and the  [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]:

$$
  ({\vert -\vert}\dashv Sing)
  \;\colon\;
  Top_{Quillen}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{Sing}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{{\vert -\vert}}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\phantom{{}_{Q}}\simeq_{Q}}
  sSet_{Quillen}
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, the adjunction is indeed a [[Quillen adjunction]]: prop. \ref{SingDetextsAndReflectsFibrations} says in particular that $Sing(-)$ takes [[Serre fibrations]] to [[Kan fibrations]] and prop. \ref{TopologicalRealizationOfsSetLandsInCWComplexes} gives that ${\vert-\vert}$ sends monomorphisms of simplicial sets to [[relative cell complexes]].

Now prop. \ref{UnitOfSingularNerveAndRealizationIsWEOnKanComplexes} says that the [[derived adjunction unit]] and [[derived adjunction counit]] are weak equivalences, and hence the Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.
