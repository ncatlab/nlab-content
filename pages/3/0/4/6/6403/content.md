## Idea

A _Killing spinor_ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]] is a _[[spinor]]_  -- a [[section]] of some [[spinor bundle]] $v \in \Gamma(S)$ -- that is taken by the  [[covariant derivative]] of the corresponding [[Levi-Civita connection]] to a multiple of itself

$$
  \nabla_v \psi = \kappa \gamma_v \psi
$$

for some constant $\kappa$.

If that constant is 0, hence if the spinor is _covariant constant_, then one also speaks of a _covariant constant spinor_ or _parallel spinor_ (with respect to the given metric structure).

Notice however that a Killing spinor with non-vanishing $\kappa$ may be understood as a genuine covariantly constant spinor, but with respect to a [[super-Cartan geometry]] modeled not on [[super-Euclidean space]]/[[super-Minkowski spacetime]], but on its spherical/hyperbolic or deSitter/anti-deSitter versions spring


Similarly a _[[Killing vector]]_ is a covariantly constant [[vector field]].

Pairing two covariant constant spinors to a vector yields a Killing vector. 

In [[supergravity]], [[super spacetimes]] which solves the [[equations of motion]] and admit Killing spinors are _[[BPS states]]_ (at least if they are asymptotically flat and of finite mass).
