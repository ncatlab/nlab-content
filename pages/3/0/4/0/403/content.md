#Internal Categories and Groupoids#

The notion of a [[category]] can be formulated [[internalization|internal]] to any other category with enough [[pullback|pullbacks]]. By regarding [[group|groups]] as one-object [[groupoid|groupoids]], this generalizes the familiar way in which, for instance

 * topological groups are groups _internal to topological spaces_
 
 * Lie groups are groups _internal to manifolds_.

#Definition#

Let $A$ be any category. A _category internal to $A$_ is 

 * a collection of morphisms in $A$ of the form
  $$
    C_1 \stackrel{s,t}{\to} C_0 \stackrel{i}{\to} C_1
  $$
  such that the pullback 
  $$
    \array{
      C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1 &\to& C_1
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{t}
      \\
      C_1 &\stackrel{s}{\to}& C_0
    }
  $$
  exists;

 * and a morphism
  $$
     C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1 \stackrel{comp}{\to} C_1
  $$
  "respecting $s$ and $t$";

 * such that the _composition_ $comp$ is associative
   and unital with respect to $i$ "in the obvious way".

A [[groupoid]] internal to $A$ is all of the above 

 * such that the cartesian product $C_1 \times C_1$ exists

 * and a morphism
  $$
     C_1 \stackrel{s}{\to} C_1
  $$


 * such that
   $$
     \array{
        C_1 &\stackrel{diag}{\to}& C_1 \times C_1
        \\
        \downarrow^s && \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
           \downarrow^{comp \;\; (Id \times s)}
        \\
        C_0 &\stackrel{i}{\to}& C_1
     }
     \,.
   $$


#Terminology#

 * $C_0$ is the "object of objects"; $C_1$ is the "object of morphisms", for instance for $A = Top$ $C_0$ is the "space of objects" and $C_1$ the "space of morphisms".

#Examples#

* A [[Baez-Crans 2-vector space]] is a category internal to [[Vect]].
* A [[double category]] is a category internal to [[Cat]]. 
* A [[double bicategory]] is a category internal to [[Bicat]] (in a suitably weak sense).
* A [[small category]] is a category internal to [[Set]].
* A [[crossed complex]] is equivalent to a category internal to [[Grp]].
* Historically, the motivating example was (apparently) the notion of [[Lie groupoid|Lie groupoids]]: groupoids internal to the category [[Diff]] of manifolds. 

#Functors#

Functors between internal categories are defined in a similar fashion. See [[functor]].  But if the ambient category does not satisfy the [[axiom of choice]] it is often better to use [[anafunctor|anafunctors]] instead.
