This entry is about the isotope and isotopy in algebra, for isotopy in geometry see [[isotopy]]; homotopy of quasigroups is also covered, do not mix with the notion from [[homotopy theory]].
For [[isotope]] in chemistry and nuclear physics see wikipedia; along with [[isotopic spin]] might be once covered in $n$Lab.
