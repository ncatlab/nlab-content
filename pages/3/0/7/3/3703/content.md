# Bases and subbases

## Idea

For many notions of [[structure]], particularly for [[topological concrete category|topological categories]], one can specify a structure by a _base_ or _subbase_ that generate the structure.  Besides being convenient ways to specify a structure, they may even be necessary when using weak [[foundations]].

Warning:  Sometimes one says '[[basis]]' instead of 'base', but I think that it\'s safest to save the former for the generating set of a [[free object]], especially in an [[algebraic category]].  Although a basis and a base can both generate something, they tend to behave in very different ways.  (It doesn\'t help that 'bases' is the plural of both.)


## Examples

### Bases for topologies

...


### Bases for uniform structures

...


### Sites: bases for toposes

...


## General theory

Is there a general theory of bases?  That\'s a good question.  I don\'t know!
