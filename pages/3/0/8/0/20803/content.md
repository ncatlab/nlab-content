__Operational methods/calculus__ are (systematic) methods to reduce some problems in analysis, typically solving differential equations, by reducing them to algebraic problems (and often also algebraic combinatorics). Most well known are methods involving [[Laplace transform]] and [[umbral calculus]]. Though it would fit the above description, this term usually does not refer to the theory of D-modules (where [[algebraic analysis]] is sometimes used term) nor differential algebra with [[Picard-Vessiot theory]] ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Vessiot_theory)).
