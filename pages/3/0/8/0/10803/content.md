## Idea

The term _$p$-adic cohomology_ usually refers to [[cohomology]] over [[spaces]] in [[p-adic geometry]].

For instance by the [[comparison theorem (crystalline cohomology)|comparison theorem]] in [[crystalline cohomology]], in positive [[characteristic]] $p$ it is equivalent to [[de Rham cohomology]] in [[p-adic geometry]];

Notice that by "$p$-adic cohomology" one could also mean [[cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in [[p-adic numbers]]. An example of this is [[ℓ-adic cohomology]] which has [[p-adic number|ℓ-adic]] [[coefficients]], genuinely so over the [[pro-étale site]]).

[arXiv:1212.3813] Comparison Isomorphisms for Smooth Formal Schemes
from arXiv Front: math.NT by Fabrizio Andreatta, Adrian Iovita
For a smooth proper scheme or formal scheme over an unramified, complete DVR
of mixed characteristics we prove a comparison isomorphism relating etale
cohomology of the generic fiber with values in a crystalline etale sheaf to the
crystalline cohomology of its special fiber with values in the associated
F-isocrystal.

from arXiv Front: math.AG by Alberto Dario Arabia, Zoghman Mebkhout
In order to have cohomological operations for de Rham p-adic cohomology with
coefficients as manageable as possible, the main purpose of this paper is to
solve intrinsically and from a cohomological point of view the lifting problem
of smooth schemes and their morphisms from characteristic p > 0 to
characteristic zero which has been one of the fundamental difficulties in the
theory of de Rham cohomology of algebraic schemes in positive characteristic
since the beginning. We show that although smooth schemes and morphisms fail to
lift geometrically, it is as if this was the case within the cohomological
point of view, which is consistent with the theory of Grothendieck Motives. We
deduce the p-adic factorization of the Zeta function of a smooth algebraic
variety, possibly open, over a finite field, which is a key testing result of
our methods.
