The **double comma object** of three morphisms $f:A\to D$, $g:B\to D$, and $h:C\to D$ in a [[2-category]] can be defined as
$$(f/g/h) = (f/g)\times_B (g/h)$$
where $(f/g)$ and $(g/h)$ are the ordinary [[comma object]]s.  It can also be characterized as a [[2-limit]] in its own right.

### Examples

* If $A=C=1$ are the [[terminal category]] in [[Cat]] and $g$ is the identity functor, then $f=x$ and $h=y$ are objects of $D$ and $(f/g/h) = (x/D/y)$ is sometimes called the **[[over category|over]]-[[under category|under]]-category**.

* If $f,g,h$ are all the identity functor of $A$, then $(f/g/h)$ is the [[power]] $A^{(\to\to)}$, the "object of composable pairs in $A$."
