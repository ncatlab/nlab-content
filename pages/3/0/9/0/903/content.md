In the easry years of the 20th century it was known that the nonabelian fundamental group $\pi_1(X,a)$ of a space $X$ with base point $a$ was useful in geometry and complex analysis. It was also known that the abelian homology groups $H_n(X)$ existed for all $n \geq 0$ and that if $X$ is  connected then $H_1(X)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X,a)$ made abelian. 

Consequently it was hoped to generalise the fundamental group to higher dimensions. 

In 1932, E. \v{C}ech proposed a definition of higher homotopy groups using maps of spheres, but the paper was rejected for the Zurich ICM since it was found that these groups $\pi_n(X,a)$ were abelian for $n \geq 2$, and so do not really generalise the fundamental group.  

Nonetheless they have proved to be important but difficult to compute in general, in comparison with homology groups. 

It was early realised that the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1 X$ operates on the family of groups $\{\pi_n(X,a)| a \in X\}$ which should thus together  be regarded as a  module over $\pi_1 X$. 

A key property of homotopy groups is the Whitehead theorem: if $f:X \to Y$ is a map of path connected spaces each of the homotopy type of a CW-complex, and $f$ induces isomorphisms $\pi_n(X,a) \to \pi_n(Y,fa)$ for all $n \geq 1$, then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. 

However, the homotopy groups by themselves, even considering the operations of $\pi_1$, do not characterise homotopy types. See also [[algebraic homotopy theory]].
