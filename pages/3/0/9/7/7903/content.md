## Idea


In the context of [[twisted cohomology]] a [[cocycle]] on a [[space]] $X$ with [[coefficients]] in a coefficient object $V$ is not quite a direct morphism $X \to V$ as in ordinary $G$-[[cohomology]], but is instead a [[section]] of a $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] $E \to X$ over $X$. This is called the _local coefficient bundle_ for the given twisted cohomology. Its class $[E] \in H^1(X, \mathbf{Aut}(V))$ is the _twist_.
