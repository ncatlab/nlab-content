
Michael Barr is the Peter Redpath Emeritus Professor of Pure Mathematics at McGill University. Although his earlier work was in [[homological algebra]], his principal research area for a number of years has been [[category theory]]. 

He is on the editorial boards of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science and the electronic journal Homology, Homotopy and Applications, and is editor of the electronic journal Theory and Applications of Categories. Michael Barr has much advocated the methods of his late student Jon Beck, involving [[monads]], especially monadicity criteria and [[monadic cohomology]].

Barr is well known to theoretical [[computer science|computer scientists]] for his book

*  _Category Theory for Computing Science_ with [[Charles Wells]],

as well as for the development of [[star-autonomous category|star-autonomous categories]] and [[Chu space]]s which have found various applications in computer science. Also

*  _$*$-autonomous categories_,

*  _Acyclic Models_, CRM monographs, 2002,

Introducing [[Barr-exact categories]] and [[regular categories]]:

* {#BarrGrilletvonOsdool} [[Michael Barr]],  [[Pierre Grillet]], [[Donovan van Osdol]], *Exact Categories and Categories of Sheaves*,  Lec. Notes in Math. __236__, Springer 1971, ([doi:10.1007/BFb0058579](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0058579)) 
 

On [[toposes]], [[monads]] ("triples") and [[algebraic theories]]:

*  [[Michael Barr]], [[Charles Wells]], _[[Toposes, Triples, and Theories]]_, Grundlehren der math. Wissenschaften 278. Springer-Verlag, 1983, [ftp](ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/ttt/), [web](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/ttt.html), [pdf](http://www.case.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/ttt.pdf), which has been [republished](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/12/tr12abs.html) in the [[TAC reprints series]].


On an improved context for [[Pontrjagin duality]]:

* [[Michael Barr]], *On duality of topological abelian groups* ([pdf](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/ftp/pdffiles/abgp.pdf), [[Barr_PontrjaginDuality.pdf:file]])


  > Did you know that there is a [[star-autonomous category|*-autonomous category]] of topological abelian groups that includes all the LCA groups and whose duality extends that of Pontrjagin?  The groups are characterized by the property that among all topological groups on the same underlying abelian group and with the same set of continuous homomorphisms to the circle, these have the finest topology.  It is not obvious that such a finest exists, but it does and that is the key.
