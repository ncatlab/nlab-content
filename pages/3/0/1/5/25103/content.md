## Idea 
 {#Idea}

By a *stucture identity principle* one means a statement of the form that all "identifications" of [[mathematical structures]] of a given [[type]] are necessarily *structure respecting* identifications (see also *[[structuralism]]*).

The source of the exact term "structure identity principle" seems to be [Aczel (2011, slide 7)](#Aczel11), but the idea will have occurred earlier (see also the *[[principle of equivalence]]*).

The literature on the subject arguably suffers from absence of global conventions on how to name different notions of "identification" (*identity*, *equality*, *isomorphism*, *equivalence*, ...), which can be confusing when speaking about a principle that is all about the fine-print of identifying two nominally different notions of identifications... But the general idea is always the same: Faced with notions of "direct"- and of "structure preserving"-identifications, a structure-identity-principle asserts that they are suitably identical.

Concretely,  [Aczel (2011, p. 9)](#Aczel11) declares that the structure identity principle (SIP) in [[homotopy type theory]] *is* the [[univalence axiom]]: This of course identifies [[terms]] $p \,\colon\, Id_{Type}(A,B)$ of [[identification type]] between [[types]] $A,B \,\colon\, Type$ with [[functions]] that are  [[equivalence in type theory|type-theoretic equivalences]] $f \,\colon\,  A \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} B$. 

The latter is what [Aczel (2011, p. 22)](#Aczel11) calls "[[isomorphisms]]". While this matches the usage of the term "[[isomorphism]]" in abstract [[category theory]] to mean "[[invertible morphism]]", to complete the notion of "structure identity" one may want a further argument to verify that such isomorphisms really are invertible [[homomorphisms|*homo*-morphism]] with respect to some given [[mathematical structure]] (such as [group structure](structure#GroupDataStructure) etc.). Such enhancement of Aczel's notion of SIP is considered in [Coquand & Danielsson (2013)](#CoquandDanielsson13) (who do not use the terminology "structure udentity principle") and in [UFP13, §9.8](#UFP13) (who do).

## Examples
 {#Examples}

To make this more concrete and more manifest, we may notice that:

1. at least a large class of kinds of [[mathematical structures]] on a base type $B \,\colon\, Type$ are expressible as nothing but "[[telescope type|telescopes]]" of [[dependent pairs]] of $B$ with an iteration of further [[dependent pair]]- and [[dependent function]]- and [[identification types]] (for examples, such as [[group object|group structure]], see [here](structure#InDependentTypeTheory));

1. the [[univalence axiom]] implies extensionality principles for all three of these [[type formations]] (so with regards to [UFP13](#UFP13) this is now using §2, instead), namely [[dependent function|dependent]] [[function extensionality]] ([here](function+extensionality#InTypeTheory)) and its analog for dependent pairs ([here](dependent+sum+type#ExtensionalityPrinciple)):

Together this means exactly that 

* identifications of two structured types which both are iterated dependent function-, dependent pair- and identity-types of the same form 

* are equivalent to giving the corresponding dependent function- and dependent pairing of componenwise identifications... 

  ...and this is just what one wants to mean by "preserving" this structure as in the notion of *[[homomorphisms]]*.

\linebreak

For example, with the type of [[group object|group structures]] defined as 

<img src="/nlab/files/GroupDataType-230121.jpg" width="710">

then the above extensionality principles (eq:ExtensionalityPrinciples) imply that the [[type of identifications]] of groups is equivalently that of [[bijections]] of the underlying types and equipped with the [[group homomorphism]]-property:
