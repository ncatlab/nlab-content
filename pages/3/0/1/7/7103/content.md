## Definition

A **finite $(\infty,1)$-limit** is an [[(∞,1)-limit]] over a finitely presented [[(∞,1)-category]] -- a [[finite (∞,1)-category]].

If we model our (∞,1)-categories by [[quasicategories]], then this can be made precise by saying it is a limit over some [[simplicial set]] with finitely many nondegenerate [[simplices]].  Note that such a simplicial set is rarely itself a quasicategory; we regard it instead as a finite presentation of a quasicategory.

###### Proposition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ out of an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ that has all finite $(\infty,1)$-limits preserves these finite $(\infty,1)$-limits as soon as it preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] and the [[terminal object]].

###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[small (∞,1)-category]] with finite $(\infty,1)$-limits, and $\mathbf{H}$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. Write $PSh(C)$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $C$. 

If a functor $F : PSh_\infty(C) \to \mathbf{H}$ preserves [[(∞,1)-colimits]] and finite $(\infty,1)$-limits of [[representable functor|representables]], then it preserves all finite $(\infty,1)$-limits.

This appears as ([Lurie, prop. 6.1.5.2](#Lurie)).

## Examples

* Binary products, pullbacks, and terminal objects are all finite $(\infty,1)$-limits.

* Unlike the case in [[1-category]] theory, the [[split idempotent|splitting of idempotents]] is *not* a finite $(\infty,1)$-limit.
