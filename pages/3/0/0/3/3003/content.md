# Idea #

A **conical space** is a set equipped with a notion of taking real-linear combinations with nonnegative coefficients of its elements.  We may tersely define it as a [[module]] of the [[rig]] $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$: that is, the rig of nonnegative real numbers, with ordinary addition and multiplication as the rig operations.

# Relation to vector spaces #

Any rig homomorphism $A \to B$ gives a 'restriction of scalars' functor $R: B Mod \to A Mod$ and 'extension of scalars' functor $L: A Mod \to B Mod$.  In particular, 
the rig homomorphism 

$$\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

produces a pair of adjoint functors between the category of $\mathbb{R}$-modules (that is, real [[vector spaces]]) and $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$-modules (that is, conical spaces).  

In simple English: any real vector space has an underlying  conical space, and any conical space freely generates a real vector space.
