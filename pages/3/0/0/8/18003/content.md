## Idea

In [[physics]] one says "superfield" when referring to a [[field (physics)]] in the context of [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] field theory.

Technically, given a [[supermanifold]] $X$ ("[[superspace]]"), then the superspace of _superfields_ is the [[internal hom]] $\underline{Hom}(X,\mathbb{R})$ or $\underline{Hom}(X,\mathbb{C})$ of real or complex valued functions on $X$.

See at _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_ for more
