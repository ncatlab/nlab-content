The __trefoil knot__ is a famous [[knot]]. One of the reasons is that in the list of knots, ordered by  [[crossing number]], it is the first 'real' knot one meets, being the simplest non-trivial knot. (The first knot listed is usually the 'unknot', i.e. the unknotted circle.) The trefoil has crossing number 3.

The [[knot group]] of the trefoil knot (calculated either by the Dehn or Wirtinger presentations) has two very useful presentations:

* $\langle x,y \mid xyx=yxy\rangle$, which is the [[braid group]], **Br 3**;

*  $\langle a,b | a^2= b^3\rangle$, in which the pair of numbers, $(2,3)$ is apparent.  These reflect the fact that the trefoil is a $(2,3)$-[[torus knot]].
