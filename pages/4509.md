Consider a (possibly structured) category $A$ in which one has some standard notion of a chain complex and of acyclic chain complex, e.g. [[abelian category]], or [[semiabelian category]]. 

Given an object $M$ in $A$ one can consider it also as a complex concentrated at zero. 

A _resolution_ is an acyclic nonpositive complex $P_\cdot$ which coaugments $M$ or an acyclic nonnegative complex $I^\cdot$ which augments $M$, i.e. it is equipped with a map of complexes $P_\cdot \to M$ or a map of complexes $M\to I^\cdot$.
 
If each object $P_n$ is a projective object then  $P_\cdot \to M$ is a projective resolution, and if each $I^n$ is an injective object then $M\to I^\cdot$ is an injective resolution. 

There are further generalizations like unbounded resolutions etc.
