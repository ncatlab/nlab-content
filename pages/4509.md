## Idea

In a [[homotopical category]] $C$, a _resolution_ of an object $X$ is another object $\hat X$ equipped with a weak equivalence $\hat X \to X$ or $X \to \hat X$ such that $\hat X$ has certain nice properties that $X$ lacks.

## In a model category

If $C$ is a [[model category]] then the most important resolutions are _cofibrant resolutions_ and _fibrant resolutions_ .

A **fibrant resolution of $X$ is a fibrant object $\hat X$ equipped with a weak equivalence into it

$$
  X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \hat X \to \gt *
  \,.
$$

A **cofibrant resolution** of $X$ is a cofibrant object $\hat X$ equipped with a weak equivalence out of it

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarow \hat X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X
  \,.
$$

Notice that the factorization axioms of a [[model category]] ensure that such resolutions always exist.

Of course for the notion of fibrant resolution to make sense, also the ambient structure of a [[category of fibrant objects]] works. For cofibrant resolutions a [[Waldhausen category]] does the job, etc.



## In chain complexes

If $C$ is a category of [[chain complex]]es in a suitable (possibly structured) [[abelian category]] or [[semiabelian category]] $A$ then one can in particular consider resolutions of ordinary objects of $A$ -- regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0 - by chain complexes of $A$.

A _resolution_ is an acyclic nonpositive complex $P_\cdot$ which coaugments $M$ or an acyclic nonnegative complex $I^\cdot$ which augments $M$, i.e. it is equipped with a map of complexes $P_\cdot \to M$ or a map of complexes $M\to I^\cdot$.
 
If each object $P_n$ is a [[projective object]] then  $P_\cdot \to M$ is a **projective resolution** , and if each $I^n$ is an [[injective object]] then $M\to I^\cdot$ is an **injective resolution** . These are fibrant and cofibrant resolutions in the suitable [[model structure on chain complexes]].

There are further generalizations like unbounded resolutions etc.
