## Idea

The notion of _homotopy spectral sequence_ adapts the notion of _[[spectral sequence]]_ from [[homological algebra]]/[[stable homotopy theory]] to unstable/[[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] [[homotopy theory]]. 

Where a [[spectral sequence]] consists of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in an [[abelian category]] -- which typically come from the ([[cohomology group|co-]])[[homology groups]] of a ([[cochain complex|co-]])[[chain complex]] or generally from the  [[homotopy groups]] of a [[stable homotopy type]] -- the notion of homotopy spectral sequence is modeled on the [[homotopy groups]] of ([[pointed object|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]]/[[homotopy types]] which in the lowest two degrees consist instead of [[nonabelian groups]] and ([[pointed sets|pointed]]) [[sets]].
