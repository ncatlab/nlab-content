## Idea

Given any kind of [[cohomology theory]], it is [[contravariant functor]] on some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ of [[spaces]] of sorts. For example, for [[ordinary cohomology]] or [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theories]] this functor goes from [[pointed topological spaces|pointed]] [[CW-complexes]] $X$ (or more generally: [[CW-pairs]]) to [[graded abelian groups]] $E^\bullet(X)$.

The value of this functor on any morphism $f \;\colon\; X \to Y$ is called the _pullback in $E$-cohomology_ $f^\ast \;\colon\; E^\bullet(Y) \to E^\bullet(Y)$.

Notice that, a priori, this is not related to the notion of [[pullback]] in the sense of a [[cospan]]-shaped [[limit]] in some [[category]], though for good enough "geometric cycles" for $E$-cohomology the notions may actually agree. For example, pullback in $G$-[[non-abelian cohomology]] is given by forming the [[pullback bundles]] of the $G$-[[principal bundles]] which are classified by the given cohomology classes.
