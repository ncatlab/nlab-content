## Idea

A **polycategory** is like a [[category]] or a [[multicategory]], but where both the [[domain]] and the [[codomain]] of a [[morphism]] can be [[finite set|finite]] [[lists]] of [[objects]] rather than just single objects.

## Properties

### Relation to PROPs

A (multicolored) [[PROP]] can also be described as a polycategory; what distinguishes a polycategory from a PROP is that in a polycategory, we can only compose along one object at once.  That is, we have a composition operation

$$\circ_D \colon Hom(A,B;C,D,E) \times Hom(F,D,G; H) \to Hom(F,A,B,G; C,H,E)$$

but not an operation such as

$$\circ_{B,C} \colon Hom(A; B,C) \times Hom(B,C; D) \to Hom(A,D).$$

### Internal logic

Polycategories provide a natural [[categorical semantics]] for [[linear logic]].
