## Idea

It is a classical fact that the [[rationalization]] of classical [[homotopy theory]] (of [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]]) -- called _[[rational homotopy theory]]_ -- is considerably more tractable than general [[homotopy theory]], as exhibited by the existence of small concrete [[dg-algebra|dg-algebraic]] models for [[rational homotopy types]]: [[minimal Sullivan algebras]]. A similar statement holds for [[stable homotopy theory]], i.e. the [[homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]] (of [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]]): rational spectra are equivalent to rational [[chain complexes]], i.e. to [[dg-modules]] over $\mathbb{Q}$, see at _[[rational stable homotopy theory]]_.

Now classical [[homotopy theory]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] are unified and jointly generalized in [[parameterized stable homotopy theory]], whose [[objects]] are [[parameterized spectra]], parameterized over a classical [[homotopy type]]. The _rational parameterized stable homotopy theory_ to be discussed here is supposed to be the rationalization of this joint generalization, unifiying and jointly generalizing the algebraic model of [[rational topological spaces]] by [[Sullivan algebras]] and of $H \mathbb{Q}$-[[module spectra]] by [[chain complexes]].

Here we (intend to) show that, accordingly, rational parameterized homotopy theory is presented by the the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the [[homotopical category]] of [[dg-modules]] over cochain [[differential graded-commutative algebras]] in non-negative degrees.
