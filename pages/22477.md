## Idea

A __W\*-category__ is a [[horizontal categorification]] of a [[von Neumann algebra]].

W\*-categories are in the same relation to [[C*-categories]]
as [[von Neumann algebras]] are to [[C*-algebras]].

## Definition

A __W\*-category__ is a [[C*-category]] $C$
such that for any objects $A,B\in C$, the [[hom-object]] $Hom(A,B)$
admits a [[predual]] as a [[Banach space]].
That is, there is a [[Banach space]]
$Hom(A,B)_*$ such that $(Hom(A,B)_*)^*$ is isomorphic to $Hom(A,B)$
in the category of [[Banach spaces]] and [[contractive maps]] (alias _short maps_).

## W\*-functors

A __W\*-functor__ is a [[functor]] $F\colon C\to D$
such that $F(f^*)=F(f)^*$ for any [[morphism]] $f$ in $C$
and the map of [[Banach spaces]] $Hom(A,B)\to Hom(F(A),F(B))$
admits a [[predual]] for any objects $A$ and $B$ in $C$.

## Bounded natural transformation

The good notion of natural transformations between W\*-categories
is given by __bounded natural transformations__:
a [[natural transformation]] $t\colon F\to G$ between W\*-functors
is bounded if the norm of $t_X\colon F(X)\to G(X)$
is bounded with respect to the object $X$ of $C$.

## The bicategory of W\*-categories

W\*-categories, W\*-functors, and bounded natural transformations
form a [[bicategory]].

This [[bicategory]] is a good setting to work with objects
like [[Hilbert spaces]], [[Hilbert W*-modules]] over [[von Neumann algebras]], [[W*-representations]] of [[von Neumann algebras]], etc.

In particular, in this [[bicategory]],
the [[category of Hilbert spaces]] has infinite [[direct sums]] (generalizing the definition of a [[biproduct]] to infinite families of objects),
unlike in the usual [[bicategory]]
of [[categories]], [[functors]], and [[natural transformations]],
where it only has [[finite limits]] and [[finite colimits]].

The same is true for [[Hilbert W*-modules]] over [[von Neumann algebras]], [[W*-representations]] of [[von Neumann algebras]].
