**[Math-Phys-Cat](https://math-phys.group)** is a Brazilian research group concerned with [[mathematical physics|Mathematical-Physics]], [[categorification]] and [[higher category theory and physics]]. We are mainly interested in mathematical aspects of [[classical field theory|classical]] and [[quantum field theories]], especially those involving [[category theory]] and [[gauge theory]], also in the axiomatization problem of astrophysics and in using [[category theory|category-theoretic]] language in order to unify and abstract concepts in classical [[algebra]] and in [[differential geometry]].

* Website: [math-phys.group](https://math-phys.group).

* On the birth of the group: [Mathematical Physics or Mathematical-Physics?](https://math-phys.group/math-phys/). 

* We also have a [blog](https://math-phys.group/math-phys), where we write about our works. There you will also find a column, called [This Quarterly Finds on Math-Phys-Cat Group](https://math-phys.group/category/this-quarterly-finds-on-math-phys-cat-group/) in honor to Baez's seminal [This Week's Finds on Mathematical Physics](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), where quarterly we present what our group has been doing.

## Contact

* The best way to contact us is through the email `contact@math-phys.group`.

* We also have a Zulipchat. If would like to join us, please, contact us.

## Activies

* Since it was created, our group has been offered courses, minicourses and a lot of student seminars (a weekly seminar where the students present his studies). See [here](https://math-phys.group/activities/). For some of them a detailed schedule and lecture notes are available.

* We are also planning to start online Group Seminars (weekly seminars, where in each week a different member present something), which will be shared [here](https://math-phys.group/group-seminars/), and also in this page. External speakers are welcome. If you are interested, please, contact us.

## Current Members

## Internal Structure

Our group does not receive any outside assistance. Since the process of maintaining, organizing and updating a website and their related social medias requires expensive time, which sometimes is not so recognized, in this page we would like to make explicit these hidden people and their very important work. The following is the current list of people with their corresponding internal concern. It may change over time. It is **not** displayed in order of importance.

* [Yuri Ximenes Martins](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yuri+Ximenes+Martins): admin and owner of the domain  `math-phys.group`

* Mayk Alves de Andrade: translator (notice that our site is also available in Brazilian portuguese)

* Cyro Barros Murgulo: translator

* Bryant Rosado Silva: Twitter (where the news of our group are released)

* Douglas Vilela de Paiva Silva: Academia.edu and Mendeley (repositories where our works are uploaded)

* Pedro Brunialti Lima de Andrade: updater (responsible for collecting new information and doing a quarterly update of the fundamental data of our website)

* Daniel de Souza Plácido Teixeira: creator and organizer of Zulip (where the discussion are being made) and our group seminar.
