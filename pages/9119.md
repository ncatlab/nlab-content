## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] a _reduced object_ is one whose [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal paths]] are entirely determined by its finite paths.


## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\flat_{inf}$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $&#643;_{inf}$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

A **reduced object** or **reduced type** is one in the [[full subcategory]] defined by the leftmost modality $\Re$. 

## Examples

* An object $D$ whose reduced reflection is the [[terminal object]], $Red(D) \simeq * $ is an _[[infinitesimally thickened point]]_.

* A [[smooth manifold]] is a reduced [[formal smooth manifold]].

* A [[reduced scheme]] is one all whose local [[rings]] of functions have no non-zero nilpotent elements.
