
This page is about [[William Lawvere]]'s Ph.D. thesis:

* F. W. Lawvere, _Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories_, Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1963.

Written under [[S. Eilenberg]] and highly influential, the dissertation was not published at the time, and only two short notices appeared:

* F. W. Lawvere, _Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories_, Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci. **50** (1963) pp.869--872. ([pdf](http://www.pnas.org/content/50/5/869.full.pdf))

* F. W. Lawvere, _Algebraic theories, algebraic categories, and algebraic functors_, pp.413--418 in Addison, Henkin, Tarski (eds.), _The Theory of Models_, North-Holland Amsterdam 1965.

It got finally published together with an author's comment and a supplement in: 

* Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories, No. 5 (2004) pp 1--121 ([tac](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html)).

In the thesis, Lawvere introduces [[Lawvere theories]] and the [[categorical semantics|functorial perspective]] into model theory. He takes steps towards axiomatizing [[ETCC|the category of categories as a foundation for mathematics]]. This  includes introducing the notion of [[comma category]] as an auxiliary to a definition of [[adjoint functors|adjunction]] implicitly involving an isomorphism of [[2-sided discrete fibrations]] (cf. Lawvere 2004 pp.12--13).
