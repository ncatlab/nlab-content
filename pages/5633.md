Eric Sharpe works on [[theoretical physics]] related to [[string theory]] with an emphasis on structural aspects and mathematical formalization. He got his Phd under [[Edward Witten]].

Sharpe has early on realized the role of [[higher differential geometry]] in the form of [[stacks]] and [[gerbes]] in [[string theory]]. He identified string theorists's  "[[discrete torsion]]" with the [[equivariant cohomology]] of [[bundle gerbes]] on [[orbifolds]] ([Sharpe 99](#Sharpe99), [Sharpe 01](#Sharpe01)) and he was the first to consider the possibility that  [[target spaces]] for [[string]] [[sigma-models]] may themselves be [[stacks]]/[[gerbes]] ([Pantev-Sharpe 05a](#PantevSharpe05a), [Pantev-Sharpe 05b](#PantevSharpe05b), [Hellerman-Sharpe 10](#HellermanSharpe10)).

More recently he has been investigating [[quantum sheaf cohomology]].

In ([Sharpe 15](#Sharpe15)) he lays out a general perspective of the role of [[2-group]] and generally [[n-group]] ([[infinity-group]]) global [[higher gauge symmetry]] in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]].
