# Exhaustive categories

## Idea

A [[category]] is **exhaustive** if it has [[colimits]] of (transfinite) sequences of [[monomorphisms]] which interact well with [[pullbacks]].

## Definition

A category $C$ is **exhaustive** if the following two conditions hold.

* Given a transfinite sequence 
  $$ A_0 \to A_1 \to \cdots $$
  (continuing through $A_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\lt\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is some limit [[ordinal]]) for which each transition map $A_\alpha \to A_\beta$ is a [[monomorphism]], there exists a colimit (a [[transfinite composition]]) $A_\kappa$.

* Suppose given a diagram
  $$\array{
    B_0 & \to & B_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & B_\kappa\\
    \downarrow && \downarrow &&&& \downarrow\\
    A_0 & \to & A_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\kappa\\
  }$$
  in which the bottom row is a transfinite composition, and for each $\alpha\lt\beta\lt\kappa$, the morphism $A_\alpha\to A_\beta$ is monic and the square
  $$ \array{ B_\alpha & \to & B_\beta \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow \\
    A_\alpha & \to & A_\beta } $$
  is a [[pullback]] (hence $B_\alpha \to B_\beta$ is also monic).  Then the top row is a transfinite composition if and only if for all $\alpha\lt\kappa$ the square
  $$ \array{ B_\alpha & \to & B_\kappa \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow \\
    A_\alpha & \to & A_\kappa } $$
  is a pullback.

Note that half of the second condition is simply that the colimits in the first condition are stable under pullback.  One may obtain various weaker notions by restricting the allowable values of $\kappa$.

See Prop. \ref{AlternativeCharacterization} below for an alternative characterization of exhaustive categories.

We may refer to the transfinite composites of monomorphisms above as **transfinite unions**.


## Examples

* The category [[Set]] is easily verified to be exhaustive.

* Since limits and colimits in [[category of presheaves|presheaf categories]] are pointwise, any presheaf category $[D^{op},Set]$ is also exhaustive.

* Since the condition involves only colimits and finite limits, it is preserved by any [[reflective subcategory|left exact localization]].  Thus, every [[Grothendieck topos]] is exhaustive.

## Properties

###### Proposition
Given a transfinite union
$$ A_0 \to A_1 \to \cdots \to A_\kappa$$
in an exhaustive category (so that $A_\alpha \to A_\beta$ is monic for all $\alpha\lt\beta\lt\kappa$), the coprojections $A_\alpha\to A_\kappa$ are also monic.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
For a fixed $\alpha$, consider the diagram
$$\array{
  A_0 & \to & A_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\alpha & \to & A_\alpha & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\alpha\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow &&&& \downarrow && \downarrow &&&& \downarrow\\
  A_0 & \to & A_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\alpha & \to & A_{\alpha+1} & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\kappa\\
}$$
It is easy to see that each intermediate square is a pullback, and of course the top row is a colimit.  Thus, in particular the square
$$\array{ A_\alpha & \to & A_\alpha \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  A_\alpha & \to & A_\kappa}$$
is a pullback, i.e. $A_\alpha\to A_\kappa$ is monic.

+-- {: .num_prop #AlternativeCharacterization}
###### Proposition
Suppose $C$ has colimits of transfinite sequences of monomorphisms for which the coprojections are also monic, as in Prop. \ref{CoprojectionsMonic}, and which are stable under pullback.  Then $C$ is exhaustive.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
It remains to show that given a diagram
$$\array{
  B_0 & \to & B_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & B_\kappa\\
  \downarrow^{f_0} && \downarrow^{f_1} &&&& \downarrow^{f_\kappa}\\
  A_0 & \to & A_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & A_\kappa\\
}$$
in which both rows are transfinite compositions of monomorphisms and the squares
$$ \array{ B_\alpha & \to & B_\beta \\
  \downarrow^{f_\alpha} && \downarrow^{f_\beta} \\
  A_\alpha & \to & A_\beta } $$
are pullbacks, also the squares
$$ \array{ B_\alpha & \to & B_\kappa \\
  \downarrow^{f_\alpha} && \downarrow^{f_\kappa} \\
  A_\alpha & \to & A_\kappa } $$
are pullbacks.

Fix an $\alpha\lt\kappa$, and suppose given $g\colon X\to B_\kappa$ such that $f_\kappa g$ factors through $A_\alpha$; we want to show that $g$ factors through $B_\alpha$.  Pulling back the $B$-colimit along $g$ and the $A$-colimit along $f_\kappa g$, we obtain another morphism of transfinite unions:
$$\array{
  g^*B_0 & \to & g^*B_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & X\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow &&&& \downarrow^{1_X}\\
  (f_\kappa g)^* A_0 & \to & (f_\kappa g)^* A_1 & \to & \cdots & \to & X\\
}$$
and it is easy to verify, by the pasting law for pullbacks, that each square
$$ \array{ g^* B_\beta & \to & g^* B_\gamma \\
  \downarrow^{f_\beta} && \downarrow^{f_\gamma} \\
  (f_\kappa g)^* A_\beta & \to & (f_\kappa g)^* A_\gamma } $$
is a pullback for $\beta\lt\gamma\lt\kappa$.  However, since $f_\kappa g$ factors through $A_\alpha$, the morphism $(f_\kappa g)^* A_\beta \to (f_\kappa g)^* A_\gamma$ is split epic whenever $\alpha\lt\beta\lt\gamma$, hence (since it is also monic) an isomorphism.  Thus, in this case so is its pullback $g^* B_\beta \to g^* B_\gamma$.  Since the coprojections into a transfinite composite of a sequence that eventually consists of isomorphisms are also eventually isomorphisms, $g^* B_\alpha \to X$ is an isomorphism; hence $g$ factors through $B_\alpha$ as desired.

###### Proposition
If an exhaustive category is also finitary [[extensive category|extensive]], then it is infinitary extensive.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A coproduct of cardinality $\kappa$ can be constructed using transfinite compositions and finite coproducts:
$$ \sum_{\alpha\lt 0} A_\alpha \to \sum_{\alpha\lt 1} A_\alpha \to \sum_{\alpha\lt 2} A_\alpha \to \cdots \to \sum_{\alpha\lt \kappa} A_\alpha $$
Finitary extensivity implies that all the transition maps are monic, so that these transfinite composites exist in an exhaustive category.  Pullback-stability of coproducts follows easily from pullback-stability of transfinite unions and of finite coproducts.  Finally, exhaustiveness allows us to reduce disjointness of $\kappa$-ary coproducts to disjointness for finitary ones.
