## Idea

A part of [[mathematical logic]] concerned with the notion of [[proof]]. It was introduced by Hilbert under the name _Beweistheorie_ as part of Hilbert's Program. Since GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem put an end to the original version of Hilbert's program, proof theory has broadened its scope to include the following:

Structural proof theory
: this is concerned with the structure of proofs and perspicuous proof calculi for elucidating this structure. This leads to the study of [[sequent calculus]] and [[natural deduction]].

Reductive proof theory
: this is modern version of Hilbert's program, in which we don't hope to secure all of mathematics with finitistic means, but rather ask: _what rests on what?_ That is, we find reductions between various systems, showing for example that some classical systems can be reduced to constructive systems, or some systems which use _a priori_ impredicative principles can nevertheless be reduced to predicative systems. See also: [[reverse mathematics]].

[[ordinal analysis|Ordinal analysis]]
: where we analyze the provably well-founded recursive ordinals and provably total recursive functions of a theory by devising suitable proof calculi

Proof mining
: where we analyze proofs of specific statements in order to extract more information than the mere truth of the statement, for instance witnesses or bounds on witnesses of existential statements.
