## Idea

There are various [[norms]] that may be placed on the [[tensor product]] of the underlying [[vector spaces]] of two [[Banach spaces]]; the result is not usually [[complete space|complete]], but of course we may take its [[completion]].  One of these, the _projective tensor product_, makes [[Ban]] (the category of Banach spaces and [[short linear maps]]) into a [[closed monoidal category]], but any of them makes $Ban$ into a [[symmetric monoidal category]].  If we start with [[Hilbert spaces]], then a different choice of norm is needed to make the result into a Hilbert space; then [[Hilb]] also becomes a closed symmetric monoidal category.


## Definitions

Let $V$ and $W$ be [[Banach spaces]], and let $V \otimes W$ be their [[tensor product]] as [[vector spaces]].  To define a tensor product of $V$ and $W$ as Banach spaces, we will place a [[norm]] on $V \otimes W$, making a [[normed vector space]]; the only difference in the following definitions is which norm to use.  Then we take the completion $V \hat{\otimes} W$, which is a Banach space.

###### Definition (projective tensor product)

Every element of $V \otimes W$ may be written (in many different ways) as a formal [[linear combination]] of formal products of elements of $V$ and $W$:
$$ \sum_i \alpha_i v_i w_i .$$
Let the __projective cross norm__ ${\|x\|_\pi}$ of an element $x$ of $V \otimes W$ be
$$ {\|x\|_\pi} \coloneqq \inf \{ \sum_i {|\alpha_i|} {\|v_i\|} {\|w_i\|} \;|\; x = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i w_i \} .$$
Then __projective tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\pi W$ of $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under the projective cross norm.

###### Definition (injective tensor product)

If $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are [[linear functionals]] on $V$ and $W$ (respectively), then $\lambda \otimes \mu$ is a linear functional on $V \otimes W$.  Let the __injective cross norm__ ${\|x\|_\epsilon}$ of an element $x$ of $V \otimes W$ be
$$ {\|x\|_\epsilon} \coloneqq \sup \{ (\lambda \otimes \mu)x \;|\; {\|\lambda\|}, {\|\mu\|} \leq 1 \} .$$
Then __injective tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\epsilon W$ of $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under the injective cross norm.

###### Definition (tensor product of Hilbert spaces)

If $V$ and $W$ are [[Hilbert spaces]], then their norms determine and are determined by their [[inner products]], so let us discuss inner products.  The elements of $V \otimes W$ are generated by elements of the form $v w$, so set
$$ \langle{v_1 w_1, v_2 w_2}\rangle \coloneqq \langle{v_1, v_2}\rangle \langle{w_1, w_2}\rangle $$
and extend by linearity.  We write the norm of an element $x$ of the [[inner product space]] $V \otimes W$ as ${\|x\|_\sigma}$.  Then the __tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\sigma W$ of the Hilbert spaces $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under this norm (or inner product).
