Kane has been arguing that [[string phenomenology]]-[[model (physics)|models]] of the kind of [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]], notably the [[G2-MSSM]], "generically" predict [[Higgs particle]] [[masses]] around 120-130 GeV. He stated this in

a few days before the result was officially announced (a useful informed comment is [here](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4262&cpage=1#comment-101525)).
