## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **free** if for every $x \in X$ and every $g\in G$, 
the equation $g x = x$ implies $g=1_G$.
Equivalently, an action is free when for any pair of elements $x,y \in X$, there is _at most one_ group element $g \in G$ such that $g x = y$.
