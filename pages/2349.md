## Definition

The **diagonal** of an [[object]] $X$ in a [[category]] with [[product]]s is the canonical [[morphism]]

$$
  \Delta : X \stackrel{(Id,Id)}{\to} X \times X
  \,.
$$

The dual concept is _[[codiagonal]]_ .

## Details

Recall that the [[diagonal subset|diagonal]] of a [[set]] is a [[subset]] of its [[cartesian product|cartesian square]] $X^2$.  If $X$ is now an object in some [[cartesian monoidal category]] $C$, then the diagonal of $X$ is now a [[subobject]] of its [[product|categorial square]] $X^2$.  (Actually, $C$ need not be cartesian monoidal, as long as the product $X \times X$ exists.)

Specifically, the __diagonal morphism__ of $X$ is a morphism $\Delta_X: X \to X^2$ given (using the universal property of the product) by the [[identity morphism]] from $X$ to itself, taken twice.  That is, $\Delta_X$ is the universal solution to
$$ \array {
                            &          & X \\
                            & \swarrow & \downarrow _ { \Delta _ X } & \searrow \\
   X                        &          & X ^ 2                       &          & X \\
   \downarrow _ { \id _ X } & \swarrow &                             & \searrow & \downarrow _ { \id _ X } \\
   X                        &          &                             &          & X
} $$
If $C$ is $Set$ (the [[category of sets]]), then this diagonal morphism is precisely the [[diagonal function]] of $X$.

## Properties

The diagonal morphism is always a [[regular monomorphism]], since it is the [[equaliser]] of the two projection maps $X^2 \to X$.  (In fact, it is a [[split monomorphism]], since it is also a [[section]] of either projection map.)  Thus, it makes $X$ into a regular [[subobject]] of $X^2$, the __diagonal subobject__.  When $C$ is the $Set$, this recovers the original notion of the [[diagonal subset]] of $X^2$.

## Examples

In the category [[Set]] the diagonal $\Delta_X$ is the [[function]] $a \mapsto (a,a)$ for all $a \in X$. See [[diagonal subset]].

In the category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]], an object $X$ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if its diagonal subobject is a [[closed subspace]] of $X^2$; this fact can be generalised to other notions of [[space]].

In [[Cat]] the diagonal morphisms are [[diagonal functors]].
