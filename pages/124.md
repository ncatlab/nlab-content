## Idea 

There are various different perspectives on the notion of _topos_.  
One is that a topos is a [[category]] that looks like a category of [[space]]s that sit by [[local homeomorphism]]s over a given base [[space]]: all spaces that are _locally modeled on_ a given base space.

The archetypical class of examples are [[sheaf topos]]es $Sh(X) = Et(X)$ over a [[topological space]] $X$: these are the categories of [[étale space]]s over $X$, topological spaces $Y$ that are equipped with a [[local homeomorphisms]] $Y \to X$. 

When $X = *$ is the [[point]], this is just the category [[Set]] of all [[sets]]: spaces that are _modeled on the point_ . This is the archetypical topos itself. 

What makes the notion of toposes powerful is the following fact: even though the general topos contains objects that are considerably different from and possibly considerably richer than plain sets and even richer than étale spaces over a topological space, the general abstract [[category theory|category theoretic]] properties of every topos are essentially the same as those of [[Set]]. For instance in every topos all small [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s exist and it is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] (even [[locally cartesian closed category|locally]]). This means that a large number of constructions in [[Set]] have immediate analogs [[internalization|internal to]] every topos, and the analogs of the statements about these constructions that are true in $Set$ are true in _every_ topos. 

On the one hand this may be thought of as saying that toposes are _very nice categories of spaces_ in that whatever construction on spaces one thinks of 
-- for instance formation of [[quotient]]s or of [[fiber product]]s or of [[mapping space]]s --
the resulting space with the expected general abstract properties will exist in the topos. In this sense toposes are _convenient categories_ for geometry -- as in: [[convenient category of topological spaces]], but even more convenient than that.

On the other hand, by de-emphasizing the geometric interpretation of their objects and just using their good abstract properties, this means that toposes are contexts with a powerful [[internal logic]]. The internal logic of toposes is [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[higher order logic]]. This means that, while the [[law of excluded middle]] and the [[axiom of choice]] may fail, apart from that, every logical statement not depending on these does hold [[internalization|internal to]] _every_ topos.

For this reason toposes are often studied as abstract contexts "in which one can do mathematics", independently of their interpretation as categories of spaces. These two points of views on toposes, as being about geometry and about logic at the same time, is part of the richness of topos theory.

On a third hand, however, we can de-emphasize the role of the objects of the topos and instead treat the topos itself as a "generalized space" (and in particular, a [[categorification|categorified]] space).  We then consider the topos $Sh(X)$ as a representative of $X$ itself, while toposes not of this form are "honestly generalized" spaces.  This point of view is supported by the fact that the assignment $X\mapsto Sh(X)$ is a full embedding of (sufficiently nice) topological spaces into toposes, and that many topological properties of a space $X$ can be detected at the level of $Sh(X)$.  (This is even more true once we pass to [[(∞,1)-toposes]].)

From this point of view, the objects of a topos (regarded as a category) should be thought of instead as *sheaves on* that topos (regarded as a generalized space).  And just as sheaves on a topological space can be identified with local homeomorphisms over it, such "sheaves on a topos" (i.e. objects of the topos *qua* category) can be identified with other *toposes* that sit over the given topos via a [[étale geometric morphism|local homeomorphism of toposes]].

Finally, mixing this point of view with the second one, we can regard toposes over a given topos $E$ instead as "toposes in the $E$-world of mathematics."  For this reason, the theory of toposes over a given base is formally quite similar to that of arbitrary toposes.  And coming full circle, this fact allows the use of "base change arguments" as a very useful technical tool, even if our interest is only in one or two particular toposes *qua* categories.


## Definitions

A quick formal definition is that an **(elementary) topos** is a [[category]] which

1. has [[finitely complete category|finite limits]],
1. is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], and
1. has a [[subobject classifier]].

There are alternative ways to state the definition; for instance,

1. [[finite limit]]s and
2. [[power objects]].

In a way, however, these concise definitions can be misleading, because a topos has a great deal of other structure, which plays a very important role but just happens to follow automatically from these basic axioms.  Most importantly, a topos is:

*  [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]],
*  [[finitely cocomplete category|finitely cocomplete]],
*  a [[Heyting category]],
*  a [[pretopos]].

The last two imply that it has an [[internal logic]] that resembles ordinary mathematical reasoning, and the presence of exponentials and power objects means that this logic is [[higher order logic|higher order]].

There are two kinds of morphisms between toposes that one considers:

* [[geometric morphism]] -- this is the kind of morphism that regards a topos as a generalized [[topological space]].

* [[logical morphism]] -- this is the kind of morphism that regards a topos in terms of its [[internal logic]].

Accordingly there is a [[2-category]] [[Toposes]] of toposes.


### Grothendieck toposes

The above is the definition of an *elementary* topos.  We also have the (historically earlier) notion of [[Grothendieck topos]]: a __Grothendieck topos__ is a topos that is neither too small nor too large, in that it is:

*  [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] (not too small), and
*  has a [[small set|small]] [[generating set]] (not too large).

Equivalently, a Grothendieck topos is any category [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[sheaves]] of some small [[site]].


### $W$-toposes

There is a further elementary property of [[Set]] that might have gone into the definition of elementary topos but historically did not: the existence of a [[natural numbers object]].  Any topos with this property is called a __topos with NNO__ or a __$W$-topos__.  The latter term comes from the result that any such topos must have (not only an NNO but also) all [[W-types]].


## Properties

While crucially different from [[abelian categories]], there is some intimate relation between toposes and abelian categories. For more on that see [[AT category]].


### Reasoning in a topos 

Any result in ordinary mathematics whose proof is [[finite mathematics|finitist]] and [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] automatically holds in any topos.  If you remove the restriction that the proof be finitist, then the result holds in any topos with a [[natural numbers object]]; if you remove the restrictions that the proof be constructive, then the result holds in any [[boolean topos]].  On the other hand, if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in the weaker sense used by constructivists, then the result may fail in some toposes but holds in any $\Pi$-[[Pi-pretopos|pretopos]]; if you add the restriction that the proof by predicative in a stronger sense, then the result holds in any [[Heyting pretopos]].

Therefore, one can prove results in toposes and similar categories by reasoning, not about the [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in the topos themselves, but instead about [[sets]] and [[functions]] in the normal language of structural [[set theory]], which is more familiar to most mathematicians.  One merely has to be careful about what axioms one uses to get results of sufficient generality.

For more on this idea, see [[internal logic]].


## Examples {#Examples}

* The archetypical topos is [[Set]]. Notice that this happens to be a [[Grothendieck topos]]: this is the [[category of sheaves]] on the [[point]].

  The [[full subcategory]] [[FinSet]] is also a topos, and the inclusion functor $FinSet \hookrightarrow Set$ is a [[logical morphism]].

  More generally, for $\kappa$ a [[cardinal|strong limit cardinal]] the full subcategory $Set_\kappa$ of sets or [[cardinality]] less than $\kappa$ is a topos.

* For $C$ any (small) [[site]], the [[category of sheaves]] $Sh(C)$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]].  Either by definition or by [[Giraud's theorem]], every Grothendieck topos arises in this way.  Important examples include:

  * The case where the [[Grothendieck topology]] is the trivial one, so that also all categories of [[presheaf|presheaves]] (on small categories) are (Grothendieck) toposes.

  * The case of sheaves on (the [[site]] given by the [[category of open subsets]] of) a [[topological space]], or more generally a [[locale]].

  * The category $G Set$ of [[set]]s equipped with the [[action]] of a [[group]] $G$: this is the topos of presheaves on the category $\mathbf{B}G$ which is the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] of $G$.

* For $E$ a topos and $X \in E$ any [[object]], also the [[overcategory]]
  $E/X$ is again a topos. ([[Elephant]], A.2.3.2). 

* If $G$ is a [[topological group]], then the category $Cont(G)$ of sets with a *continuous* action of $G$ (that is, the action map $G\times X\to X$ is [[continuous map|continuous]], where $X$ has the [[discrete topology]]) is a topos, and in fact a Grothendieck topos (though this may not be obvious).  More generally, $G$ may be a [[topological groupoid]], or even a [[localic groupoid]].  In fact, it is a theorem that every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the topos of "continuous sheaves" on a localic groupoid.

* Again if $G$ is a topological group, the category $Unif(G)$ of *[[uniformly continuous map|uniformly continuous]]* $G$-sets is also a topos, but not (in general) one of Grothendieck's.  For example, if $G$ is the [[profinite completion]] of $\mathbb{Z}$, then a continuous $G$-set is a $\mathbb{Z}$-set all of whose orbits are finite, while a uniformly continuous one is a $\mathbb{Z}$-set with a finite upper bound on the size of all its orbits.

* An obvious example of an elementary topos that is not a Grothendieck topos is the category [[FinSet]] of finite sets.  More generally, for any [[strong limit cardinal]] $\kappa$, the category of sets of cardinality $\lt\kappa$ is an elementary topos, and as long as $\kappa \gt\omega$ it has a [[NNO]].

* Since the definition of elementary topos is "algebraic," there exist [[free topos]]es generated by various kinds of data.  In particular, the category of toposes (and [[logical functor]]s) has an [[initial object]] which is sometimes called *the free topos*.  More generally, any [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] [[type theory]] (of the sort which can be interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of a topos) generates a free topos containing a model of that theory.  Such toposes (for a consistent theory) are never Grothendieck's.

* If $G$ is a [[large category|large]] [[groupoid]] with a small set of objects, then the category $[G,Set]$ (which makes sense if we define "large" and "small" relative to a [[Grothendieck universe]]) is a topos, but not in general a Grothendieck topos.  Note that this topos is in fact [[complete category|complete]] and cocomplete, but it does not have a small generating set.

* If $\mathcal{F}$ is a [[filter]] of [[subterminal objects]] in any topos $E$, then there is a [[filterquotient]] topos $E//\mathcal{F}$.  Grothendieck-ness (and completeness and cocompleteness) are not in general preserved by this construction.

* If $C$ and $D$ are toposes and $F\colon C\to D$ is a [[lex functor]], then there is a topos $Gl(F)$ called the [[Artin gluing]] of $C$ and $D$ along $F$, and defined to be the [[comma category]] $(D/F)$.  If $C$ and $D$ are Grothendieck toposes and $F$ is [[accessible functor|accessible]], then $Gl(F)$ is again Grothendieck, but in general it may not be.  (Note, though, that it is not clear whether it can be proven in ZFC that there exist any inaccessible lex functors between Grothendieck toposes, although from a proper class of [[measurable cardinal]]s one can construct an inaccessible lex endofunctor of $Set$.)

* The category of coalgebras for any lex [[comonad]] on a topos is again a topos, and if the comonad is accessible, this construction preserves Grothendieck-ness.  The Artin gluing $Gl(F)$ is equivalent to the category of coalgebras for the comonad on the topos $C\times D$ defined by $(c,d) \mapsto (c, d\times F(c))$.

* [[Todd Trimble]] has a notion called a "modal operator" on a topos, from which one can construct a new topos of "$G$-structures": see [[toddtrimble:Three topos theorems in one]].  A possibly related idea is Toby Kenney's notion of lex distributive [[diad]], from which one can also construct a topos.

* From any [[partial combinatory algebra]] one can construct a [[realizability topos]], whose [[internal logic]] is "computable" or "effective" mathematics relative to that PCA.  In particular, for [[Kleene's first algebra]], one obtains the [[effective topos]], the most-studied of realizability toposes.  Realizability toposes are generally not Grothendieck toposes.

* A topos can also be constructed from any [[tripos]].  This includes realizability toposes as well as toposes of sheaves on locales.

* For $\mathcal{T}$ any topos and $X \in \mathcal{T}$ any category, the [[over category]] $\mathcal{T}/X$ is itself a topos: the [[over-topos]].

## Special classes of toposes

For various applications one uses toposes that have [[stuff, structure, property|extra structure or properties]].

* In [[synthetic differential geometry]] one studies [[smooth topos]]es as a context for axiomatic [[differential geometry]].

* In the [[foundations]] of mathematics, one often studies [[well-pointed toposes]], especially models of [[ETCS]] as potential replacements for the category [[Set]].
