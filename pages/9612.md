## Idea

In the original use of the term, a _map_ or _mapping_ is just a _[[function]]_ (between [[sets]]).

The term is often used for [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] and indeed also generally for any [[morphism]] in any [[category]].

Accordingly, for instance the term _[[mapping space]]_ is often used synonymously for _[[internal hom]]_.
