## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a [[geometric theory]] over a [[signature (in logic)|signature]] $\Sigma$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[small category]]. Then there is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  \mathbb{T}Mod([\mathcal{C}, Set])
  \simeq
  [\mathcal{C}, \mathbb{T}Mod(Set)]
$$

between the [[category of models]] in the [[presheaf topos]] over $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ and the [[category of presheaves]] with values in $\mathbb{T}$-models.

For instance ([Johnstone, cor. D1.2.14](#Johnstone)).

Note that this continues to work for theories which involve infinitary limits as well. (The key observation is just that limits in $[\mathcal{C}, Set]$ are taken pointwise)

## Examples

###### Example

A _[[group object]]_ in a [[presheaf topos]] is equivalently a presheaf of [[groups]]. This is a fact used a lot for instance in [[homological algebra]] (for [[abelian groups]]). See at _[[group object]]_ for more.
