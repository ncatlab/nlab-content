In his talk at the 1950 ICM in Harvard, Henry Whitehead introduced the idea of *algebraic homotopy* theory and said

_"The ultimate aim of algebraic homotopy is to construct a purely
  algebraic theory, which is equivalent to homotopy theory in the same sort of 
  way that 'analytic' is equivalent to 'pure' projective geometry."_

A statement of the aims of 'algebraic homotopy' might thus include the
following homotopy classification problem (from the same source,
J.H.C.Whitehead, (ICM, 1950):

_Classify the homotopy types of polyhedra, $X$, $Y$, $\ldots$ , by algebraic data._

_Compute the set of homotopy classes of maps, $[X,Y]$, in terms of the
classifying data for $X$, $Y$._

These aims, with the possible enlargement of the class of objects of study to
include many other types of spaces, and ultimately $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]], are still valid. 

One may summarise them, optimistically,
by saying that one searches for a nice "algebraic" category $\mathbf{A}$ together 
with a functor or functors

$$\mathbf{F} : \mathbf{Spaces }\rightarrow \mathbf{A}$$

and an algebraically defined notion of 'homotopy' in  $\mathbf{A}$ such that

a) if $X\simeq Y$ in $\mathbf{Spaces}$, then $F(X) \simeq F(Y)$ in  $\mathbf
A$;

b) if $f \simeq g$ in $\mathbf{Spaces}$, then $F(f)\simeq F(g)$ in  $\mathbf
A$,

and $F$ induces an equivalence of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]]

$$Ho(\mathbf{Spaces}) \simeq Ho(\mathbf{A}).$$

[Here $\mathbf{Spaces}$ is a category, perhaps of topological spaces such as
polyhedra or CW-complexes, but it may be larger than this and may contain the
sort of 'generalised space', [[topos]], etc., used in other contexts such as algebraic
geometry, and, of course, $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]].]
