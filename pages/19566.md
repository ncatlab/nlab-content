## Idea

Given any kind of object $A$ in [[algebra]], such as an [[associative algebra]] or a [[group]] or a [[Lie algebra]], etc., then an _extension_ of $A$ is an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  \widehat A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} A
$$

Typically the [[kernel]] of an epimorphism will exist in the given [[category]], leading to a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  ker(p) \longrightarrow  \widehat A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} A
  \,.
$$

Then one says that $\widehat A$ is an _extension by $ker(p)$_ of $A$.
