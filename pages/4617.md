## Abstract

For $T$ any abelian [[Lawvere theory]], we establish a [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] between model category structures on cosimplicial $T$-algebras and on simplicial presheaves over duals of $T$-algebras. We find mild general conditions under which this descends to the local model structure that models $\infty$-stacks over duals of $T$-algebras. In these cases the Quillen adjunction models the localization 

$$
  \mathbf{L} \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C \subset T Alg^{op})
$$

of the $(\infty,1)$-topos of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves over duals of $T$-algebras at those morphisms that induce isomorphisms in cohomology with coefficients the canonical $T$-line object. In as far as objects of $\mathbf{H}$ have the interpretation of [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s the objects of $\mathbf{L}$ have the interpretatin of [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s.

For the special case where $T$ is the theory of ordinary commutative algebras this reproduces the situation of ([Toën](#Toen)) and many statements are straightforward generalizations from that situation. For the case that $T$ is the theory of _[[smooth algebra]]s_ ($C^\infty$-rings) we obtain a refinement of this to the context of synthetic differential geometry. 

As an application, we show how Anders Kock's simplicial model for synthetic combinatorial differential forms finds a natural interpretation as the differentiable $\infty$-stack of infinitesimal paths of a manifold. This construction is an $\infty$-categorical and synthetic differential resolution of the _de Rham space_ functor introduced by Grothendieck for the cohomological description of flat connections. We observe that also the construction of the $\infty$-stack of modules lifts to the synthetic differential setup and thus obtain a notion of synthetic $\infty$-vector bundles with flat connection.


## General theory


### Cosimplicial $T$-algebras

A good general notion of function algebras on generalized [[space]]s are $T$-algebras, for $T$ a [[Lawvere theory]]. A good general notion of function algebras on [[internal ∞-groupoid]]s in such spaces are [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] $T$-algebras.

We recall some basics and then discuss a [[model category]] structure on cosimplicial $T$-algebras for the cases that $T$ contains the theory of [[abelian group]]s.

#### $T$-Algebras

A [[Lawvere theory]] may be thought of as a generalization of the theory of ordinary [[associative algebra]]s. 

A Lawvere theory is encoded in its [[syntactic category]] $T$, which by definition is a category with finite [[product]]s such that every object (isomorphic to) an integer multiple $x^k$ of a fixed object $x \in T$. We are to think of the [[hom-set]] $T(k,1)$ as the set of $k$-ary operations of the algebras defined by the theory. A **$T$-algebra** is accordingly a product-preserving functor $A : T \to Set$. Its image $U_T(A) := A(1) \in Set$ is the underlying set, and its value $A(f) : U_T(A)^k \to U_T(A)$ on an element $f \in T(k,1)$ is the $k$-ary operation $f$ as implemented by $A$.

The category of $T$-algebras is the [[full subcategory]] $T Alg \subset [T, Set]$ of the [[category of presheaves]] on $T^{op}$ on these product-preserving functors.

**Examples**. 

* The category $T = \mathcal{Ab}$ of free finitely generated abelian groups is the syntactic category of the Lawvere theory whose algebras are abelian groups.

* For $k$ a field, the category $T = k$ of free finitely generated $k$-algebras is the Lawvere theory whose algebras are $k$-[[associative algebra]]s;

* The category $T = $ [[CartSp]] is the syntactic category whose algebras are [[smooth algebra]]s.

A morphism of Lawvere theories $T_1 \to T_2$ is again a product-preserving functor.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **abelian Lawvere theory** $T$ is a morphism of Lawvere theories $ab_T : \mathcal{Ab} \to T$.

=--

For $T$ abelian, $T$-algebras have an underlying [[abelian group]], given by the functor

$$
  ab_T^* : T Alg \to Ab
  \,.
$$

This functor is a [[right adjoint]].

For example associative algebras and smooth algebras are algebras over an abelian Lawvere theory, and their underlying abelian groups are the evident ones.

Similarly, the forgetful functor $U_T : T Alg \to Set$ has a [[left adjoint]], the free $T$-algebra functor $F_T : Set \to T Alg$. By the [[Yoneda lemma]] this sends the $n$-element set $(n)$ to $F_T(n) : k \mapsto T(n,k)$.

More generally, for any $A \in T Alg$ the copresheaf

$$
  T Alg(F_T(-), A) : T \to Set
$$

is isomorphic to $A$.

The free $T$-algebra $F_T(1)$ on a single generator may be thoigh of as the $T$-algebra of functions on the  **$T$-line**. For instance

* for $T = k$ we have that $F_T(1) = k[X]$ is the free $k$-algebra on a single generator $X$;

* for $T = CartSp$ we have that $F_T(1) = C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.

We say more on the canonical $T$-line object below in [The Line object](#Line)

#### Model structure on cosimplicial $T$-algebras

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[model structure on cosimplicial abelian groups]] $Ab^\Delta_{proj}$ whose weak equivalences are the morphism that induce [[quasi-isomorphism]] under passage to [[Dold-Kan correspondence|normalized cochain complexes]] and fibrations are the degreewise surjections.  

With respect to the [canonical sSet-enrichment](#Enrichment) of the [[category of cosimplicial objects]] $Ab^{\Delta}$, this
is a [[simplicial model category]].

For $ab_T : \mathcal{Ab} \to T$ any abelian Lawvere theory, the [[adjunction]]

$$
  T Alg^{\Delta} \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Ab^\Delta
$$

induces a [[transferred model structure]] $T Alg^{\Delta}_{proj}$ on the category of cosimplicial $T$-algebras which is also a [[simplicial model category]] with respect to its [standard sSet-enrichment](#Enrichment).

=--


### Simplicial presheaves on duals of $T$-algebras

A good notion of a generalized [[space]] modeled on objects in a category $C$ is a [[nLab:sheaf]] on $C$. A good notion of an [[nLab:∞-groupoid]] in such generalized spaces is an [[nLab:(∞,1)-sheaf]] on $C$. Such objects are modeled by the [[nLab:model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on $C$.

We are interested here in that case that 

$$
  C \hookrightarrow T Alg^{op}
$$ 

is a [[small category|small]] [[full subcategory]] of the [[nLab:opposite category]] of $T$-algebras, for $T$ an abelian Lawvere theory. In the remainder of this section we assume such a choice to be fixed. Below in the section on [Examples and applications](#Examples) we discuss concrete choices of interest.

Notice that such a choice induces also a full subcategory of (co)simplicial objects

$$
  C^{\Delta^{op}} \hookrightarow (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}
  \,.
$$


#### The prolonged Yoneda embedding {#ProlongedYoneda}

Write

$$
  j : T Alg^{op} \to [C^{op}, Set]
$$

for the ordinary [[nLab:Yoneda embedding]] and

$$
  j : (T Alg^\Delta)^{op} \to [C^{op}, sSet]
$$

for its degreewise simplicial prolongation 

$$
  j(A) : (B \in T Alg)  \mapsto ([n] \mapsto T Alg(A_n, B))
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
{#simplicialYoneda}

For $B \in T Alg$ and $(T Alg^\Delta)_s$ denoting the [simplicially enriched](#Enrichment) category of $T$-algebras, we have a natural identification

$$
  j(A) \simeq (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(-, A) 
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using [[nLab:end]]/[[nLab:coend]]-calculus for handling the [canonical enrichment](#Enrichment) of $T Alg^\Delta$, we have
for $B \in T Alg^{op} \hookrightarrow (T Alg \Delta)^{op}$
and $A \in (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}$ [[nLab:natural transformation|natural]] isomorphisms

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(B, A)_n
  & :=
  (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}(B \cdot \Delta^n, A)
  \\
  & \simeq \int_{k \in \Delta} T Alg(A_k, \prod_{\Delta(k,n)} B)
  \\
  & \simeq \int_{k \in \Delta} T Alg(\Delta(k,n)\cdot A_k, B)
  \\
  & \simeq T Alg( \int^{k \in \Delta} \Delta(k,n) \cdot A_k, B)
  \\
  & \simeq T Alg(A_n , B)
  \,,
\end{aligned}
$$

where in the last step we used the [[nLab:Yoneda lemma]] in its
coend-form (the [[nLab:co-Yoneda lemma]]).

#### The line object


Recall that we write $F_T(*)$ for the free $T$-algebra on a single generator. 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

We call $R := j(F_T(*))$ the **line object** in $[C^{op}, sSet]$. 

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

This presheaf $R$ is the one that sends a $T$-algebra $B \in T Alg$ to its underlying set $U_T(B)$

$$
  R : B \mapsto T Alg(F_T(*), B) \simeq Set(*, U_T(B)) \simeq U_T(B)
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $X \in [C^{op}, sSet]$, the [[nLab:cosimplicial set]] 

$$
  U_T(\mathcal{O}(X)) := [C^{op},sSet](X_\bullet, R) \in Set
$$

we call the cosimplicial set of $R$-valued _functions_ on $X$. This is naturally the cosimplical set underlying the cosimplicial $T$-algebra

$$
  \mathcal{O}(X) : (k \in T) \mapsto [C^{op},sSet](X_\bullet, j(F_T(k)))
  \,.
$$

We call $\mathcal{O}(X) \in T Alg^{op}$ the **$T$-algebra of functions** on $X$. This extends to a functor

$$
  \mathcal{O} : [C^{op}, sSet] \to (T Alg^{\Delta})^{op}
  \,.
$$
 
=--

In the next section we see that $(\mathcal{O} \dashv j)$ forms a [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]].

### The Yoneda-Quillen-adjunction

Fix an abelian Lawvere thery $T$. We relate the model structure on cosimplicial $T$-algebras with that of simplicial presheaves on $C \subset T Alg^{op}$.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

The functors $j$ and $\mathcal{O}$ discussed [above](#Line) constitute an [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] 

$$
  (\mathcal{O} \dashv j) : 
  (TAlg^\Delta_{proj})^{op}
  \stackrel{\overset{\mathcal{O}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{j}{\hookrightarrow}}
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We first establish the [[nLab:adjunction]] itself: using [[nLab:end]]-calculus for expressing [[nLab:hom-set]]s in [[nLab:functor category|functor categories]] we have for $X \in [C^{op}, sSet]$ and $A \in T Alg^\Delta$ [[nLab:natural transformation|natural]] isomorphisms

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}(\mathcal{O}(X), A)
  & :=
  (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}(A(-), [C^{op}, sSet](X, j(F_T(-))))
  \\
  & \simeq
  \int_{k \in T} \int_{[n] \in \Delta}
  Set(A_n(k), [C^{op}, Set](X_n, j( F_T(k)) ))
  \\
  & \simeq
  \int_{k \in T} \int_{[n] \in \Delta} \int_{B \in C}
  Set(A_n(k), Set(X_n(B), T Alg(F_T(k), B)))
  \\
  & \simeq
  \int_{k \in T} \int_{[n] \in \Delta} \int_{B \in C}
  Set(A_n(k), Set(X_n(B), B(k)))
  \\
  & \simeq
  \int_{k \in T} \int_{[n] \in \Delta} Set(X_n(B), \int_{k \in T}
   Set(A_n(k), B(k))
  )
  \\
  & \simeq
  \int_{k \in T} \int_{[n] \in \Delta} Set(X_n(B), T Alg(A_n, B))
  \\
  & \simeq
  [C^{op}, sSet](X, j(A))
  \,.
\end{aligned}
 \,,
$$

where the crucial step is the isomorphism $B(-) \simeq T Alg(F_T(-), B)$ for the line object discussed [above](#Line). 

That this lifts to an $sSet$-enriched adjunction follows with the [prolonged Yoneda lemma](#ProlongedYoneda) $j(A) \simeq (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(-,A)$ and the $sSet$-[[nLab:tensoring]] and [[nLab:cotensoring]] of $[C^{op}, sSet]_s$ and $(T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(\mathcal{O}(X), A)_n
    &
    := 
    (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}(\mathcal{O}(X), A^{\Delta^n})
    \\
    & \simeq
    [C^{op}, sSet](X, j(A^{\Delta_n}))
    \\
    & \simeq   [C^{op}, sSet](X, (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(-,A^{\Delta^n}))
    \\
    & \simeq   \int_{B \in C} sSet(X(B), (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(B,A^{\Delta^n})))
    \\
    & \simeq   \int_{B \in C} sSet(X(B), (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(B \cdot \Delta^n,A)))
    \\
    & \simeq   \int_{B \in C} sSet(X(B)\times \Delta^n , (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}_s(B,A)))
   \\
    & \simeq
    [C^{op}, sSet](X \cdot \Delta^n, j(A))
    \\
    & =: [C^{op}, sSet]_n(X, j(A))_n
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

By the pushout-product axiom satisfied by the $sSet$-[[nLab:enriched model category]] $(T Alg^\Delta)_s$ and using that in $(T Alg^\Delta_{proj})^{op}$ every object $B$ is cofibrant, we have that for $f : A_1 \to A_2$ a fibration (acyclic fibration) in $(T Alg^\Delta_{proj})^{op}$ and for $B \in C \subset T Alg^{op}$ any object, the morphism $j(A_1 \to A_2)(B) = (T Alg^{\Delta})^{op}_s(B,f)$ is a fibration (acyclic fibration) in $sSet$. Therefore $j(f)$ is a fibration (acyclic fibration) in $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$.

This establishes that $j$ is a right Quillen functor and completes the proof.

=--

The following theorem says that the obstructions to making this Quillen adjunction descent to [[nLab:local model structures on simplicial presheaves]] are mild.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $J$ be a [[nLab:subcanonical coverage]] on $C \subset (TAlg^\Delta)^{op}$, $X \in Ob(C)$ and $f : Y \to j(X)$ a [[nLab:hypercover]] with respect to $J$.

Then for $i \gt 1$ we have that $H^i(\mathcal{O}(f))$ is an [[nLab:isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

If for all (hyper-)covers $f$ we have that $H^0(\mathcal{O}(f))$ and  $H^1(\mathcal{O}(f))$ are isomorphisms then $(\mathcal{O} \dashv j)$ becomes a [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] to the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Proposition

When restricted along $C^\Delta^{op} \subset (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}$ the functor $j$ is _homotopy full and faithful_ in that for all $A \in C^{\Delta^{op}}$ we have that the canonical morphism

$$
  A \to \mathbb{L}\mathcal{O} \; \mathbb{R}j \; A
$$

into the image of the [[derived functor]]s of $j$ and $\mathcal{O}$ is an [[isomorphism]] in the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(T Alg^\Delta_{proj})$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With the above, this follows essentially verbatim as the proof of the analogous corollary 2.2.3 in ([Toën](#Toen)), to which this reduces for $T$ the theory of ordinary commutative $k$-algebras.

###  Localization of the $(\infty,1)$-topos at $R$-cohomology

In terms of the [[(∞,1)-category theory]] that is presented by the model category theoretic structures that we considered, the above model theoretic results serve to establish the following intrinsic statement

+-- {: .un_cor}
###### Corollary

The Quillen adjunction $(\mathcal{O} \dashv j)$ is a [[nLab:presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]]

$$
  \mathbf{L}(C) \stackrel{\stackrel{\mathcal{O}}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
$$

of the [[nLab:(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ which is the [[nLab:localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] at those morphisms that induce isomorphisms in $R$-cohomology, for $R$ the [canonical line object](#Line).

Here $\mathbf{L}(C)$ is the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $((T Alg^\Delta_{proj})^{op})^\circ$ on those objects in the homotopy-essential image of the inclusion $C^{\Delta^{op}} \to (T Alg^\Delta)^{op}$.
