## Idea

The term _heteromorphism_ ([Ellerman 07](#Ellerman07)) is used for the concept of a [[morphism]] not (necessarily) between two [[objects]] in the same [[category]], but between objects in two different categories that are related by a [[functor]], and typically by an [[adjoint functor]]. Indeed, sets of heteromorphism may be used to characterize [[adjunctions]]. Generally, the set of heteromorphisms is that assigned by the corresponding [[profunctor]] to the pair of objects.

The concept is also known as the _[[cograph of a functor]]_. While in traditional [[category theory]] literature the concept is maybe somewhat neglected, it serves for instance as the very definition of [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functors]] in the context of [[quasi-categories]] in ([Lurie 06](#Lurie06)) (without using the term "heteromorphism" there).

## Definition

Given two [[categories]] $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ and a [[functor]] $L \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, then for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ and $d \in \mathcal{D}$ two [[objects]], the set of _heteromorphisms_ between them is the [[hom set]]

$$
  Het(c,d) \coloneqq \mathcal{D}(L(c),d)
  \,.
$$

When $L$ has a [[right adjoint]] $R \colon \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{C}$ then this is of course equivalent to 

$$
  Het(c,d) \coloneqq \mathcal{C}(c,R(d))
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $Het \colon \mathcal{C}^{op}\times \mathcal{D}\to Set$ a [[profunctor]] from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$, then $Het(c,d)$ may be called its set of heteromorphisms.

## Properties

### Characterization of adjunctions

Heteromorphisms may be used to express/characterize [[adjunctions]]. For more on this see at
