## Idea

### For directed spaces

In generalization to how a [[topological space]] $X$ has a [[fundamental groupoid]] whose [[morphism]]s are [[homotopy]]-classes of paths in $X$ and whose composition operation is the concatenation of paths, a [[directed space]] has a **fundamental category** whose morphisms are _directed_ paths in $X$.

### For stratified spaces

A [[stratified space]] has a 'fundamental [[(infinity,n)-category with duals|n-category with duals]]', which  generalizes the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental n-groupoid]] of a plain old space.  When a path crosses a codimension-$1$ stratum, "something interesting happens" – i.e., a catastrophe.   So, we say such a path gives a noninvertible morphism.   The idea is that going along such a path and then going back is not "the same" as having stayed put. So, going back along such a path is not its inverse, just its [[dualizable object|dual]].

See Caf&eacute; [discussion] (http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006196) and paper it inspired, J. Woolf [Transversal homotopy theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3322).

### For simplicial sets

The [[left adjoint]] of the [[nerve]] functor $N:Cat \to SSet$, which takes a [[simplicial set]] to a category, is sometimes called the *fundamental category* functor.  One notation for it is $\tau_1$.  Explicitly, for a simplicial set $X$, $\tau_1(X)$ is the [[category]] [[free category|freely generated]] by the [[directed graph]] whose [[vertices]] are 0-[[simplices]] of $X$ and whose [[edges]] are 1-[[simplices]] (the source and target are defined by the [[face maps]]), modulo the relations $s^0(x) \sim id_x$ for $x \in X_0$ and $d^1(x) \sim d^0(x) \circ d^2(x)$ for $x \in X_2$.  Here $s^i$ and $d^i$ denote the [[degeneracy map|degeneracy]] and [[face maps]], respectively.

If $X$ is a [[quasicategory]], then its fundamental category is equivalent to its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]].
