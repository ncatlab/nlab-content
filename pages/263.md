#Idea#

A _category with [[weak equivalence]]s_ is an ordinary [[category]] with a class of morphisms called 'weak equivalences' that include isomorphisms, but also typically other morphisms.  Such a category should be thought of as the truncation of an [[(∞,1)-category]] where the only information kept is which of its morphisms are _equivalences_ in the full [[(∞,1)-category]].

The [[(∞,1)-category]] is recovered from the category with weak equivalences by [[simplicial localization]]. The corresponding [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]] is often computed directly as the [[homotopy category]] of the category with weak equivalences.

Surely you don\'t mean to suggest (with '*The* $(\infty,1)$-category is recovered [...]') that the composite
$$ (\infty,1) Cat \to Cat \to (\infty,1) Cat $$
is equivalent to the identity, do you?
=--

Often categories with weak equivalences are equipped with further extra structure that helps with computing the [[simplicial localization]], the [[homotopy category]] and [[derived functor]]s. 

* In a [[homotopical category]] the condition on the weak equivalences is slightly stronger.

* In a [[category of fibrant objects]] there are additional auxialry morphisms called fibrations.

* In a [[Waldhausen category]] there are additional auxialry morphisms called cofibrations.

* In a [[model category]] there are both of these additional auxiliary classes of morphisms with special interrelation between them.


#Definition#

A **category with weak equivalences** is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[subcategory]] (in the naïve sense) $W \subset C$

* which contains all isomorphisms of $C$;

* which satisfies "two-out-of-three": for $f, g$ any two composable morphisms of $C$, if two of $\{f, g, g \circ f\}$ are in $W$, then so is the third.

#Purpose#

The idea is that $C$ is a presentation of a [[higher category theory|higher category]] with higher morphisms, and that the weak equivalences are those morphisms which would become true [[equivalence]]s in this higher category.

This higher category may be reconstructed by Dwyer-Kan localization as an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]].

Alternatively, we may further project to the 1-category in which all weak equivalences become true [[isomorphism]]s: this is the [[homotopy category]] of $C$ with respect to $W$.

#Remarks#

* If we denote by $Core(C)$ the maximal subgroupoid of $C$, then we have a chain of inclusions
$ 
 Core(C) \hookrightarrow W \hookrightarrow C
$.

* Sometimes it is useful to ask further closure properties of the weak equivalences.  One such is the "2-out-of-6" property (if $g f$ and $h g$ are weak equivalences, then so are $f$, $g$, $h$, and $h g f$) in which case one speaks of a [[homotopical category]].  Another such is closure under [[retract|retracts]] in the [[arrow category]] of $C$.  Both are satisfied automatically by any [[model category]].

* Many categories with weak equivalences can be equipped with the further structure of a [[model category]]. On the other hand, some categories with weak equivalences can _not_ be equipped with a useful structure of a model category.  In particular, categories of diagrams in a model category do not always inherit a useful model structure.  Several concepts exist that weaken the axioms of a model category in order to still obtain useful results in such a case -- for instance a [[category of fibrant objects]].
