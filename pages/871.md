In a [[partial order|poset]] $P$, a __top__ of $P$ is an element $\top$ of $P$ such that $a \leq \top$ for every element $a$.  Such a top may not exist; if it does, then it is unique.

In a [[preorder|proset]], a top may be defined similarly, but it need not be unique.  (However, it is still unique up the natural [[equivalence]] in the proset.)

A top of $P$ can also be understood as a [[meet]] of zero elements in $P$.

A poset that has both top and [[bottom]] is called _bounded_.

As a poset is a special kind of [[category]], a top is simply a [[terminal object]] in that category.

The top of the poset of [[subset]]s or [[subobject]]s of a given set or object $A$ is always $A$ itself.
