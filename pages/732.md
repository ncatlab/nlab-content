##Idea##
A **group $T$-complex** is ''a [[simplicial T-complex]]'' internal to the category of groups.


More precisely:

##Definition##

A **group $T$-complex** is a pair,  $(G,T)$, in which $G$ is a [[simplicial group]] and $T$ is a graded subgroup  of $G$ consisting of _thin_ elements,  and which satisfies the conditions:

* Every degenerate element is thin.
* Every [[horn]] in $G$ has a unique thin filler.
* A thin filler of a thin box also has its last face thin.
