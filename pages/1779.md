## Definition

### In category theory

In a [[category]] $C$ with [[pullback]]s (possibly [[homotopy pullback]]s), given a [[morphism]] $U \to X$ in $C$ its corresponding **Čech nerve** $C(U)$ is the [[simplicial object]] in $C$ that in degree $k$ is given by the $k$-fold [[fiber product]] of $U$ over $X$ with itself :

$$
  C(U) :=
  \left(
    \cdots
    U \times_X U \times_X U 
   \overset{\to}\rightrightarrows U \times_X U \rightrightarrows U
  \right)
  \,.
$$


### In $(\infty,1)$-category theory

The notion of Cech nerve makes sense in any [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-pullbacks]].

See [[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]].


## Applications and occurences

* The [[cohomology]] theory obtained by mapping out of [[Čech cover]]s instead of general [[hypercover]]s is [[Čech cohomology]].

* A [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]] that is a Čech nerve $U \to X$ exhibits $X$ as a [[delooping]].

  * In an [[infinity-stack]] [[(infinity,1)-topos]] every [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]] is a Čech nerve.


## Examples

* For $U = \coprod_i U_i$ the disjoint union of  a covering [[sieve]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ with respect to a [[coverage]], the objectwise [[simplicial homotopy group|connected components]] of the Čech nerve is the subfunctor corresponding to the sieve
  $$
    \Pi_0 C(U) = \bigcup_i hom(-,U_i)
    \,.
  $$

  This is described in more detail in the section "Interpretation in terms of higher descent and codescent" at [[sieve]]. This example is important in understanding the construction of the [[etale homotopy type]] of a scheme or more generally of objects in certain types of topos. 

###Historical and pedagogic note
This example is more or less the way that [[Eduard Čech]] gave the original form of the construction that now carries his name. More on this can be found in the entry on [[Čech methods]], and the discussion there of the **nerve of an open cover**. For the case of triangulable spaces (polyhedra), for the cover by open stars of vertices of a triangulation, one retrieves the simplicial complex used to triangulate the space. This is one of the strong roots of the modern theory of cohomology as nerves of open covers can be seen as analogues of triangulations, and then [[Čech cohomology]] is seen to extend simplicial cohomology to spaces that are locally nice. That is one of the first steps on the long route to [[Grothendieck]]'s definition of topos as a generalisation of space, expressly so as to define a cohomology further extending Čech cohomology to the geometric objects studied in algebraic geometry.
