## Definition

Quite generally, in a [[category]] $C$ with [[pullback]]s (possibly [[homotopy pullback]]s), given a [[morphism]] $U \to X$ in $C$ its corresponding **Čech nerve** $C(U)$ is the [[simplicial object]] in $C$ that in degree $k$ is given by the $k$-fold [[fiber product]] of $U$ over $X$ with itself :

$$
  C(U) :=
  \left(
    \cdots
    U \times_X U \times_X U 
   \overset{\to}\rightrightarrows U \times_X U \rightrightarrows U
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This mainly plays a role in the general context of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], where Čech covers are special cases of [[hypercover]]s. 


## Applications and occurences

* The cohomology theory obtained by mapping out of Čech covers instead of general [[hypercover]]s is [[Čech cohomology]].

* A [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]] that is a Čech nerve $U \to X$ exhibits $X$ as a [[delooping]].

  * In an [[infinity-stack]] [[(infinity,1)-topos]] every [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]] is a Čech nerve.


## Examples

* For $U = \coprod_i U_i$ the disjoint union of over a covering [[sieve]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ with respect to a [[coverage]], the objectwise [[simplicial homotopy group|connected components]] of the Čech nerve is the subfunctor corresponding to the sieve
  $$
    \Pi_0 C(U) = \bigcup_i hom(-,U_i)
    \,.
  $$
  This is described in more detail in the section "Interpretation in terms of higher descent and codescent" at [[sieve]].
