[[!redirects n-truuncated strcutured (infinity,1)-topos]]
A [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}$ is called **$n$-truncated** if the image of each object of the [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)]] $\mathcal{G}$ is an [[n-truncated object of an (infinity,1)-topos|n-truncated object of]] $\mathcal{X}$.

See [[derived scheme]] and [[derived Deligne-Mumford stack]] for discussion of examples of $n$-truncated structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes.
