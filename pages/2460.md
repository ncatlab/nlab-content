Given a ring $R$ and a family $S$ of morphisms in the category of (say left) finitely generated projective $R$-modules, we say that a morphism of rings $f:R\to T$ is $S$-inverting if the extension of scalars from $R$ to $T$ sends all morphisms from $S$ into invertible morphisms in the category of left $T$-modules. P. M. Cohn has shown that there is a universal object $R\to Q_S R$ in the category of $S$-inverting morphisms. Ring $Q_S R$ (and more precisely the universal morphism itself) are called the universal or Cohn localization of ring $R$ at $S$.   
Cohn localization induces a hereditary torsion theory, but it lacks good flatness properties at the level of full module category. However for the category of finite-dimensional projectives has all good properties -- it is not any worse than [[Ore localization]].
