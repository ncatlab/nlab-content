
What are called _Weyl relations_ is the incarnation of [[canonical commutation relations]] under passing to [[exponentials]]. 

For example if $a,a^\ast$ are two elements of an [[associative algebra]] with [[commutator]]

$$
  [a,a^\ast] = \hbar
$$

then the corresponding Weyl relation is, by the [[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula]],

$$
  e^{z a}e^{z^\ast a^\ast} = e^{z^\ast a^\ast} e^{z a} e^{\hbar z z^\ast} 
$$

for $z,z^\ast \in \mathbb{C}$
