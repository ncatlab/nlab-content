## Idea

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Cup_or_faces_paradox.svg/450px-Cup_or_faces_paradox.svg.png" width="200"></div>

The concept of [[adjunction]] as such expresses a [[duality]]. The stronger concept of an _adjoint cylinder_ or _adjoint [[modality]]_ is specifically an [[adjunction]] between [[idempotent monad|idempotent (co-)monads]] and is meant to express specifically a _duality between opposites_. 


In terms of the corresponding [[adjoint triple]] of [[reflective subcategory|(co-)reflections]] and [[localizations]] the concept was suggested in ([Lawvere 91, p. 7](#Lawvere91), [Lawvere 94, p. 11](#Lawvere94)) to capture the phenomena of "Unity and Identity of Opposites" as they appear informally in [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_. 
(One might therefore say the notion is meant to capture the idea of "dialectic", though there is some debate as to whether Hegel's  somewhat mythical "creation out of [[paradox]]" should really go by this term, see [this Wikipeda entry](#Wikipedia) ).

In terms of [[adjoint pairs]] of [[modal operators]] in the context of [[modal logic]]/[[modal type theory]] and thought of as [[Galois connections]] the concept appears in ([Reyes-Zolfaghari 91](#ReyesZolfaghari91)). Further developments along these lines include ([DJK 14](#DJK14)).


## Definition

In ([Lawvere 94](#Lawvere94)) an _adjoint cylinder_ is defined to be an [[adjoint triple]] such that the outer two adjoints are [[full and faithful functors]]. This means equivalently that the  induced [[adjoint pair]] on the codomain of these inclusions consists of an [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[monad]] and [[comonad]] ([[adjoint monads]]). One may also consider the situation where the middle functor of the adjoint triple is fully faithful, hence one has adjoint [[modal operators]]
either of the form

$$
  U \;\colon\; modality \dashv comodality
  \,,
$$

or of the form 

$$
  U \;\colon\; comodality \dashv modality
  \,.
$$

A category equipped with an adjoint modality of the second form is called a _[[category of being]]_ in ([Lawvere 91](#Lawvere91)). If the category is a [[topos]] then this is also called a _[[level of a topos]]_.

Given any such, we may say that the "unity" expressed by the two opposites is exhibited by the canonical [[natural transformation]]

$$
  U X 
  \;\colon\;
  \array{
    comodal X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& modal X
    \\
    opposite\;1 && unity && opposite\;2
  }
$$

which is the composite of the [[counit of a comonad|counit of the comodality]] and the [[unit of a monad|unit of the modality]].

If for two [[level of a topos|levels]] the next one contains the [[modal types]] of the [[idempotent comonad]] of the former, then [[Lawvere]] speaks of "[[Aufhebung]]" (see there for more).

One can consider longer sequences of such adjoints of co/modalities, but the longer they get, the less likely they are to be non-trivial. The longest that still has good nontrivial models seems to be [[adjoint triples]] of modalities. Of these there is then similarly either the form

$$
  modality \dashv comodality \dashv modality
$$

(the "Yin triple") as for instance in the definition of _[[cohesion]]_ and

$$
  comodality \dashv modality \dashv comodality
$$

(the "Yang triple") as for instance in the definition of _[[differential cohesion]]_.

Since adjoint triples are equivalently [[adjunctions]] of [[adjunctions]] ([Licata-Shulman, section 5](#LicataShulman)), it is suggestive to denote these as

$$
  \array{
    \lozenge &\dashv& \bigcirc
    \\
    \bot && \bot 
    \\
    \bigcirc &\dashv& \Box
  }
$$

## Examples

### Simple illustrative examples
 {#SimpleIllustrativeExamples}


The following simple illustrative example of an adjunction of the form $\Box \dashv \bigcirc$ has been suggested in ([Lawvere 00](#Lawvere2000)).

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Consider the two inclusions $even, odd \colon (\mathbb{Z},\lt ) \hookrightarrow (\mathbb{Z},\lt)$ of the even and the odd integers, i.e. the maps $n \mapsto 2 n$ and $n \mapsto (2n+1)$, respectively.

Both are adjoint to the operation of forming the $floor$ of the result of dividing by two, this is right adjoint to the inclusion of even numbers, and left adjoint to the inclusion of odd numbers.

The adjoint modalities, $\Box \dashv \bigcirc$, are then the composites $\Box(n) \coloneqq 2 \cdot floor(n/2)$ and $\bigcirc (n) \coloneqq 2 \cdot floor(n/2) + 1$

=--

In the same vein there is an example for an adjunction of the form $\bigcirc \dashv \Box$:

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Consider the inclusion $\iota \colon (\mathbb{Z}, \lt) \hookrightarrow (\mathbb{R}, \lt)$ of the [[integers]] into the [[real numbers]], both regarded [[linear orders]]. This inclusion has a [[left adjoint]] given by $ceiling$ and a right adjoint civen by $floor$. The composite $Ceiling \coloneqq \iota ceiling$ is an [[idempotent monad]] and the composite $Floor \coloneqq \iota floor$ is an [[idempotent comonad]] on $\mathbb{R}$. Both express a _moment of integrality_ in an real number, but in opposite ways, each real number $x\in \mathbb{R}$ sits in between its floor and celling

$$
  Floor(x) \lt x \lt Ceiling(x)
  \,.
$$

Indeed the moments form an [[adjunction]]

$$
  Ceiling \dashv Floor
  \,.
$$


=--



### Werden : Sein $\dashv$ Nichts
 {#Werden}

For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]]/[[(∞,1)-topos]] consider the "initial topos", the [[terminal category]] $\ast \simeq Sh(\emptyset)$ ([[category of sheaves]] on the empty site).

There is then an [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\vdash \ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\vdash \emptyset}{\longleftarrow}}}
  \ast
$$

given by including the [[initial object]] $\emptyset$ and the [[terminal object]] $\ast$ into $\mathbf{H}$.


In the [[type theory]] of $\mathbf{H}$ this corresponds to the [[adjoint pair]] of [[modalities]]

$$
  \emptyset \dashv \ast
Consider the inclusion $\iota \colon (\mathbb{Z}, \lt) \hookrightarrow (\mathbb{R}, \lt)$ regarded as an inclusion of linear orders. This inclusion has a left adjoint given by $ceiling$ and by $floor$. The composite $\bigcirc \coloneqq \iota ceiling$ is an idempotent monad and the composite $\Box \coloneqq \iota floor$. Both express a _moment of integrality_ in an real number, but in opposite ways. Indeed they are adjoint $\bigcirc \dashv \floor$.
$$

which are constant on the [[initial object]]/[[terminal object]], respectively.

The induced unity transformation is

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \ast
  }
$$

hence the unique factorization of the unique function $\emptyset \longrightarrow \ast$ through any other [[type]].


Looking through ([Hegel 1812, vol 1, book 1, section 1, chapter 1](#Hegel1812)) one might call $\emptyset$ "nothing", call $\ast$ "being" and then call this unity of opposites "becoming". In particular in §174 of _[[Science of Logic]]_ it says

> there is nothing which is not an intermediate state between being and nothing

which seems to be well-captured by the above unity transformation.

### Quantity : discreteness $\dashv$ continuity
 {#Mengen}

The adjoint modality in a [[local topos]] is that given by
[[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]

$$
  \flat \dashv \sharp
  \,.
$$

Capturing [[discrete objects]]/[[codiscrete objects]].

The corresponding unity transformation is

$$
    \flat X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \sharp X
$$

According to ([Lawvere 94, p. 6](#Lawvere94)) this unity captures the duality that in a [[set]] all [[elements]] are distinct and yet indistinguishable, an apparent [[paradox]] that may be traced back to [[Georg Cantor]].  

Looking through Hegel's [[Science of Logic]] at _[On discreteness and repulsion](#Science+of+Logic#OnDiscretenessAndRepulsion)_ one can see that matches with what Hegel calls

> (par 398) Quantity is the unity of these moments of continuity and discreteness

$$
  \array{
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \sharp X
    \\
    {moment\;of \atop discreteness} && && {moment\;of \atop continuity}
  }
$$


### Continuuum : repulsion $\dashv$ cohesion
 {#ContinuumRepulsionCohesion}

For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[cohesive topos]]/[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]
the [[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] constitute an adjoint cylinder

$$
  &#643; \dashv \flat
  \,.
$$

The corresponding unity-transformation is the [points-to-pieces transform](cohesive%20topos#CanonicalComparison)

$$
  \array{
    \flat X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow &#643; X
  }
$$

Looking through ([Hegel 1812, vol 1, book 1, section 2, chapter 1](#Hegel1812)) one might call $\flat$ "repulsion", call $&#643;$ "attraction"/"[[cohesion]]" and then call this unity of opposites "[[continuum]]". Indeed, by the discussion at _[[cohesive topos]]_, this does quite well capture the geometric notion of continuum geometry.

### Infinitesimal Continuuum : infin. repulsion $\dashv$ infinit. cohesion
 {#ContinuumRepulsionCohesion}

For $\mathbf{H}$ equipped moreover with [[differential cohesion]],
there is the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] version of 
[[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]]  namely the adjoint modality

[[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]]


$$
  \Im \dashv \&
  \,.
$$

The corresponding unity-transformation is the 

$$
  \array{
    \Im X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \& X
  }
$$

maps from the [[coefficients]] for [[crystalline cohomology]] to the [[de Rham space]] of types $X$, where all infinitesimal neighbour points are identified. 

In view of the above the unity exhibited here is clearly to be called the "infinitesimal continuum".



### Cohesive sets

The combination of the above two examples of [Continuum](#ContinuumRepulsionCohesion) and [Quantity](#Mengen) is an [[adjoint triple]] of [[modalities]]

$$
  &#643; \;\dashv\; \flat \;\dashv\; \sharp
$$

[[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]

characteristic of a [[cohesive topos]].

### Skeleta and Co-Skeleta

[[simplicial skeleton]] $\dashv$ [[simplicial coskeleton]]


### Formal completion $\dashv$ Torsion approximation
 {#FormalCompletionAndTorsionApproximation}

For $A$ a [[commutative ring]] or more generally an [[E-∞ ring]] and $\mathfrak{a}\subset \pi_0 A$ a suitable ideal, then $\mathfrak{a}$-[[adic completion]] and $\mathfrak{a}$-[[torsion approximation]] form an adjoint modality on $A MMod$ the [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-category of ∞-modules]] $A Mod_\infty$ over $A$. 

  ($\mathfrak{a}$-adic completion) $\dashv$ ($\mathfrak{a}$-torsion approximation)

+-- {: .num_prop #CompletionTorsionAdjointModalityForModuleSpectra}
###### Proposition

Let $A$ be an [[E-∞ ring]] and let $\mathfrak{a} \subset \pi_0 A$ be a [[generators and relations|finitely generated]] ideal in its underlying [[commutative ring]].

Then there is an [[adjoint triple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]]

$$
  \array{
    \underoverset{
      A Mod_{\mathfrak{a}comp}^{op}}
    {A Mod_{\mathfrak{a}tors}^{op}}
    {\simeq}
    &\stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{\mathfrak{a}}}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\underset{\flat_{\mathfrak{a}}}{\longleftarrow}}}&
    A Mod^{op}
  }
$$

where

* $A Mod$ is the [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-category of modules]], i.e. of [[∞-modules]] over $A$;

* $A Mod_{\mathfrak{a}tor}$ and $A Mod_{\mathfrak{a} comp}$ are the [[full sub-(∞,1)-categories]] of $\mathfrak{a}$-[[torsion approximation|torsion]] and of $\mathfrak{a}$-[[completion of a module|complete]] $A$-[[∞-modules]], respectively;

* $(-)^{op}$ denotes the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]];

* the [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] on the left is induced by the restriction of $\Pi_{\mathfrak{a}}$ and $\flat_{\mathfrak{a}}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is effectively the content of ([Lurie "Proper morphisms", section 4](#LurieProper)):

* the existence of $\Pi_{\mathfrak{a}}$ is corollary 4.1.16 and remark 4.1.17

* the existence of $\flat_{\mathfrak{a}}$ is lemma 4.2.2 there;

* the equivalence of sub-$\infty$-categories is proposition 4.2.5 there.

=--


See at _[[fracture theorem]]_ for more.

### Fermions and supergeometry

On [[super smooth infinity-groupoids]] there is an adjoint modality
deriving from the [adjoint triple relating plain algebra and superalgebra](super+algebra#AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra).
The [[right adjoint]] deserves to be called the [[bosonic modality]] ("[[body]]"), hence its [[left adjoint]] the [[fermionic modality]].
This expresses the presence of [[supergeometry]]/[[fermions]], hence ultimately the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Following [PN§290](Science+of+Logic#290) this unity of opposties might hence be called "asunderness".

### Totally distributive categories

For $\mathcal{K}$ a [[totally distributive category]]
it induces on its [[category of presheaves]] an adjoint modality whose [[right adjoint]] is the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y$ postcomposed with its [[left adjoint]] $X$.

### Traditional

The concept of _dialectical reasoning_ is usually attributed to  

* [[Plato]], second part of the _[[Parmenides dialogue]]_ . 

See 

* [[Georg Hegel]], _[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]] -- [Plato -- Dialectic -- Parmenides dialogue](Lectures+on+the+History+of+Philosophy#ParmenidesDialogue)_

Hegel in his _[History of Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hpeleatics.htm)_ writes that dialectic begins with [[Zeno]] (one of the characters in that dialogue).
