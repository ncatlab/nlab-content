# Measurable locales

## Idea

Measurable locales are certain [[locales]], which may serve as a basis for [[measure theory]] much as general locales serve as a basis for [[topology]] (especially in [[constructive mathematics]]).

Ironically, in [[constructive mathematics]], measurable locales are *not* locales (except for the [[empty space]]), on pain of [[excluded middle]].

The concept appears to be due to [[Dmitri Pavlov]].


## Definitions

At present, there is no purely [[order theory|order-theoretic]] definition of measurable locales.  However, there are a few other ways of defining them.  We give first definitions appropriate for [[classical mathematics]].

As a preliminary step, consider the [[category]] $Comp Bool Alg_{sup}$ of [[complete boolean algebras]] and [[supremum]]-preserving [[homomorphisms]] of boolean algebras.  This is a [[full subcategory]] of the category $Frm$ of [[frames]] and so its [[opposite category]] $Comp Bool Alg_{sup}^{op}$ is a full subcategory of the category [[Loc]] of locales.  The category $Meas Loc$ of measurable locales is yet further a full subcategory of $Comp Bool Alg_{sup}^{op}$, so our job is simply to specify *which* complete boolean algebras are the [[objects]] of this category.

By one definition, a complete boolean algebra $L$ is a __measurable locale__ if there is a [[complete measure space]] $X$ such that $L$ is [[isomorphic]] (as a boolean algebra) to the boolean algebra $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$ of [[measurable subsets]] of $X$ modulo [[null subsets]].  Note that the measure on $X$ is irrelevant except to specify the null subsets.  In this way, $Meas Loc$ becomes [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category $Loc Meas$ of [[localisable measurable spaces]].

By another definition, a complete boolean algebra $L$ is a __measurable locale__ if for every element $x \neq 0$ of $L$ there is a normal measure (see below) $\mu$ on $L$ valued in $[0,\infty]$ such that $\mu(x) = 1$.

By yet another definition, a complete boolean algebra $L$ is a __measurable locale__ if there is a commutative $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebra]] $A$ such that $L$ is [[isomorphic]] (as a boolean algebra) to the boolean algebra $Proj(A)$ of [[projection operator]]s in $A$; see [[idempotent operator]] for a construction of $Proj(A)$.  In this way, $Meas Loc$ becomes [[dual equivalence|dual]] to the category $Comm W^* Alg$ of commutative $W^*$-algebras.

Whichever of these equivalent definitions is adopted, a __measurable function__ between measurable locales is simply a [[continuous map]] between them as locales; these are the [[morphisms]] of $Meas Loc$.


### In constructive mathematics

(This is the only section not due to Pavlov.)

For purposes of [[constructive mathematics]], [[Toby Bartels|I]] suspect that it is appropriate to use the definition from $W^\star$-algebras, so long as we allow norms to be [[upper real numbers]].  (If they are all [[located real number|located]], then $Proj(A)$ has [[decidable equality]], which we don\'t want to require.)  I\'m less certain whether the other definitions can work.

For this definition, we need not require that $L \cong Proj(A)$ be complete (or even a boolean algebra); this can be proved ... classically.  But constructively $Proj(A)$ need not be complete (although it is still a boolean algebra).  Indeed, consider the point (see the examples), based on $A \coloneqq \mathbb{C}$, which is *not* the complete [[Heyting algebra]] of *all* [[truth values]] but only the (possibly incomplete) boolean algebra $\{\bot, \top\}$ of *classical* truth values (corresponding to the self-adjoint idempotent complex numbers $0$ and $1$).

It seems to me that there is some notion of completeness that applies here; $L$ should in some sense be 'measurably complete'.  In the point, for example, the [[subsingleton]] $\{* \;|\; P\}$, where $P$ is a truth value, is measurable iff $P$ is true or false, so the supremum of $\{\top \;|\; P\}$ exists in $L$ under the same circumstances.  Figuring this out could allow the definitions through measurable spaces or normal measures to work.


## Examples

The [[empty space]], which is [[initial object|initial]] in $Meas Loc$, is the [[terminal object|terminal]] boolean algebra with one element.

The [[point]], which is [[terminal object|terminal]] in $Meas Loc$, is the [[initial object|initial]] boolean algebra $\{\bot, \top\}$ of (classical) [[truth values]].

The [[real line]] is the boolean algebra of Lebesgue-[[measurable sets]] of [[real numbers]] modulo the [[null sets]].  This is complete as a boolean algebra because ... \[argument needed\] (and even constructively, it is still a boolean algebra).

Applying the classification of $W^*$-algebras, we find that (up to [[isomorphism]]), every measurable locale is a [[direct product]] (of boolean algebras, which is a [[coproduct]] in $Meas Loc$) of points or of points and infinitely many real lines; a single real line is already isomorphic to the product of countably infinitely many real lines.  (Of course, we can\'t expect this [[classification theorem]] to hold constructively.)


### The Borel real line

To do [[measure theory]], it\'s important to know how to interpret the [[real line]] with the [[Borel sets]] (rather than Lebesgue sets) as a measurable space.  This is actually a little tricky, because [[Lebesgue measure]] is not complete on the Borel sets, and passing to the Lebesgue sets gives a different measurable space.  We might simply take the Borel sets as they are (so that only the empty set is null), but then this is not complete as a boolean algebra.

One might suspect that there is no Borel real line in $Meas Loc$, which would cast serious doubts on that as a category for measure theory.  But we can [argue by abstract nonsense](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/31603/why-do-probabilists-take-random-variables-to-be-borel-and-not-lebesgue-measurab/31724#31724) (specifically the [[representable functor theorem]]) that it must exist, although it is quite large: something like an uncountable product of points and lines.

More generally, [[topological spaces]] give rise to rather complicated measurable locales by taking the Borel sets and applying an analogous argument, while [[smooth manifolds]] give rise to much simpler measurable locales by taking the Lebesgue sets (possible since we know which sets are null sets on a manifold).  Both processes are [[functors]] ($B\colon Top \to Meas Loc$ and $L\colon Top Man \to Meas Loc$).


## Measures

On *any* complete boolean algebra $L$, given any [[abelian monoid]] $R$ equipped with a [[convergence space|convergence structure]] (such as $[0,\infty]$), a __normal measure__ on $L$ valued in $R$ is a [[function]] $\mu\colon L \to R$ such that:

*  _[[inclusion-exclusion|additivity]]_: $\mu(\bot) = 0$ and $\mu(x \wedge y) + \mu(x \vee y) = \mu(x) + \mu(y)$;

*  _[[Scott continuity|continuity]]_: if $S$ is a downward-[[codirected set|directed]] [[subset]] of $L$ whose [[infimum]] is the [[bottom element]], then the [[net]] $(\mu(x))_{x\colon S}$ converges to $0$.

One could, of course, define a garden-variety [[measure]] by requiring continuity only when $S$ is the image of a decreasing [[sequence]], but apparently normal measures are what we want for measurable locales.

(Perhaps there is a theorem that non-atomic measures on, say, Lebesgue space correspond to normal measures on the real line as a measurable locale?  Certainly [[Lebesgue measure]] is not normal on the $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets, but presumably it is normal on the boolean algebra of measurable sets modulo null sets, which is what we want.)
