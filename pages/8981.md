## Definition

On a [[local topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ acts a [[monad]] $\sharp$ corresponding to the extra [[right adjoint]] of the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]]. The _sharp modality_. It has a [[left adjoint]] modality, the [[flat modality]].

## Properties

### Relation to discrete and codiscrete objects

* The [[codiscrete objects]] in a local topos are the [[modal types]] for the sharp modality.

* The [[discrete objects]] in a local topos are the [[modal types]] for the [[flat modality]].
