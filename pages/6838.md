## Idea

The notion of _dg-schemes_ was introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] as
the first approach to [[derived algebraic geometry]], and was further
developed by [[Mikhail Kapranov]] and [[Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine]].

## Definition

A **differential graded scheme** (**dg-scheme**) is a [[scheme]] $(X,
O_X)$ together with a [[sheaf]] $O_X^\bullet$ of nonnegatively graded
commutative [[dg-algebra|differential graded]] $O_X$-[[dg-algebra|algebras]], such that $O_X \to H^0(O_X^\bullet)$ is
[[surjective]].

## Examples

[[Ciocan-Fontanine]] and [[Kapranov]] construct $RQuot(X, F)$, a
derived enhancement of the classical [[Quot scheme]] parametrizing
subsheaves of a given [[coherent sheaf]] $F$ on a smooth projective
[[variety]] $X$ [(1999)](#CiKa1).  Similarly they also construct a
dg-scheme $RHilb_h(X)$, a derived enhancement of the [[Hilbert
scheme]] parametrizing [[subschemes]] of a given [[projective scheme]]
$X$ with [[Hilbert polynomial]] $h$ [(2000)](#CiKa2).  As an
application they construct the [[derived moduli stack]] of [[stable
maps]] of [[curves]] to a given [[projective variety]].

## Relation with derived stacks

There is a [[functor]] from the [[category]] of dg-schemes to the
category of [[derived stacks]] of [[Bertrand Toen]] and [[Gabriele
Vezzosi]].  It takes values in the [[full subcategory]] of 1-geometric
derived stacks, but is not known (or expected) to be [[fully
faithful]].

In particular, the dg-schemes $RQuot(X, F)$ and $RHilb_h(X)$,
discussed above, also induce [[derived stacks]] in the modern sense.
