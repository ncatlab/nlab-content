## Idea

A [[field (physics)|field]] configuration of the [[physical theory]] of _gravity_ on a [[spacetime]] $X$ is equivalently

* a [[vielbein]] field, hence a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] along $\mathbf{B} O(n-1,1) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$, defining a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]];

* a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] that is locally a [[Lie algebra-valued 1-form]] with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]].

  $$
    (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d-1,1)
  $$

  such that this is a [[Cartan connection]].

(This parameterization of the gravitational field is called the [[first-order formulation of gravity]].) The component $E$ of the connection is the [[vielbein]] that encodes a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] $g = E \cdot E$ on $X$ and makes $X$ a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. Its quanta are the [[graviton]]s.

The [[non-propagating field]] $\Omega$ is the [[spin connection]].

The [[action functional]] on the space of such connection which defines the [[classical field theory]] of gravity is the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]].

More generally, [[supergravity]] is a [[gauge theory]] over a [[supermanifold]] $X$ for the [[super Euclidean group|super Poincare group]]. The field of supergravity is a Lie-algebra valued form with values in the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]].

$$
  (E,\Omega, \Psi) : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)
$$

The additional [[fermion]]ic field $\Psi$ is the [[gravitino]] field.

So the [[configuration space]] of gravity on some $X$ is essentially the [[moduli space of Riemannian metrics]] on $X$.

### General

Textbooks include

* [[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], [[John Wheeler]], _[[Gravitation]]_, 1973

The theory of gravity based on the standard [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] may be regarded as just an [[effective quantum field theory]], which makes some of its notorious problems be non-problems:

### Covariant phase space
 {#CovariantPhaseSpaceReferences}

The (reduced) [[covariant phase space]] of gravity (presented for instance by its [[BV-BRST complex]], see there fore more details) is discussed for instance in
