In [[computer programming]], homoiconicity (from the Greek words _homo_ meaning "the same" and _icon_ meaning "representation") is a property of some [[programming languages]] in which the [[program]] [[structure]] is similar to its [[syntax]], and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout. If a language has homoiconicity, it means that the language text has the same structure as its [[abstract syntax tree]] (i.e. the AST and the syntax are [[isomorphic]]).

In a homoiconic language the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a [[primitive type]] of the language itself. This makes [[metaprogramming]] easier than in a language without this property, since [[code]] can be treated as [[data]]: [[reflection]] in the language (examining the program's entities at [[runtime]]) depends on a single, homogeneous structure, and it does not have to handle several different structures that would appear in a complex syntax. To put that another way, homoiconicity is where a program's source code is written as a basic data structure that the programming language knows how to access.

A typical, commonly cited example is the programming language [[Lisp]], which was created to be easy for lists manipulation and where the structure is given by [[S-expression]]s that take the form of [[nested]] [[lists]]. 
Lisp programs are written in the form of lists; the result is that the program can access its own functions and procedures while running, and programmatically reprogram itself on the fly. Homoiconic languages typically include full support of [[syntactic macros]] allowing the programmer to express program transformations in a concise way. A more recent example is the programming language [[Clojure]], which is a contemporary dialect of Lisp.
