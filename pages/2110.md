The solution set condition appears as part of the hypothesis in Freyd's [[adjoint functor theorem|General Adjoint Functor Theorem]] and can be stated as follows:

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ satsifies the condition if for every object $Y$ of $D$ there exists a small (set-indexed) family of morphisms $f_i : Y \to F(X_i)$ such that any morphism $h : Y \to F(X)$ can be written as $F(t) \circ f_i$ for some $t : X_i \to X$ and some $i$.

This is a smallness condition in that the family is required to be indexed by a set.
