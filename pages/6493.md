Given a discrete groupoid $G$ with the set of objects $G_0$ and the set of morphisms $G_1$, one defines its __inertia groupoid__ as the groupoid whose space of objects is the space of loops, i.e. the equalizer of the source and target maps $s,t: G_1\to G_0$; whose space of maps from $f: a\to a$ to $g: b\to b$ consists of the commutative squares with the same vertical maps of the form 

$$\array{a &\stackrel{f}\rightarrow& a\\
u \downarrow && \downarrow u\\
b &\stackrel{g}\rightarrow& b
}$$

i.e. of the morphisms $u : a\to b$ in $G_1$ such that $u^{-1}\circ g\circ u = f$.


If a ([[differentiable stack|differential]], [[topological stack|topological]] or [[algebraic stack|algebraic]]) stack (or, in particular, an [[orbifold]]) is represented by a groupoid, then the inertia groupoid of that groupoid represents another stack (orbifold).

For [[quantum field theory]] on orbifolds the inertia orbifold is related to so called twisted sectors of the corresponding QFT. One can also consider more generally twisted multisectors.
