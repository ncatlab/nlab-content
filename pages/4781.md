## Definition

Let $\pi : P \to X$ be a [[bundle]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifolds]]. A [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(P)$ is _vertical_ with respect to this bundle if it is in the [[kernel]] of the [[derivative]] $d \pi \colon T P \to T X$.


A [[differential form]] on $P$ is a [[horizontal differential form]] with respect to $P \to X$ it it vanishes on vertical vector fields.
