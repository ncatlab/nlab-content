## Idea

Hilbert schemes are [[moduli space|moduli spaces]] of subvarieties, hence [[configuration space (mathematics)|configuration spaces]] in [[algebraic geometry]].

For instance a scheme of 0-dimensional sub-schemes is called a _[[Hilbert scheme of points]]_, etc.

Specifically for [[projective variety|quasi-projective variety]] with fixed [[Hilbert polynomial]], Hilbert schemes are well behave as moduli spaces go, in that they're actually quasi-projective varieties themselves.

The existence and construction of Hilbert schemes is due to Grothendieck (FGA). 

The Hilbert scheme of $\mathbb{C}^2$ is widely studied in combinatorics and geometric representation theory for its connections to [[Macdonald polynomials]] and [[Cherednik algebra]]s.
