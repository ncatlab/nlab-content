Hilbert schemes are [[moduli space|moduli spaces]] of subvarieties of a [[projective variety|quasi-projective variety]] with fixed [[Hilbert polynomial]].  They're very nice as moduli spaces go, in that they're actually quasi-projective varieties.

The Hilbert scheme of $\mathbb{C}^2$ is widely studied in combinatorics and geometric representation theory for its connections to [[Macdonald polynomial]]s and [[Cherednik algebra]]s.
