## Idea

This entry discusses the [[quantization]] of the [[prequantum field theory|prequantum]] data of standard 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] (induced from a suitable [[Lie group]] and [[invariant polynomial]]/[[second Chern class]] [[action functional]]) to a [[3d TQFT]].

The steps involved in the [[geometric quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] are indicated at _[Chern-Simons theory -- Geometic quantization](Chern-Simons+theory#GeometricQuantization)_.

It was long expected that the resulting [[3d TQFT]] is that given by the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]], which is a kind of state sum model that produces an [[FQFT]] from the data of a [[modular tensor category]], such as the category of [[positive energy representations]] of the [[loop group]] of $G$, or else of a [[quantum group]]. 

More recently all the ingredients of a proof that this is indeed equivalently the result of the [[geometric quantization]] are appearing ([Andersen 12](#Andersen12)). See also ([MO discussion](#MODiscussion)).

## General idea

> under construction

Chern-Simons functional

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S_{CS}) \colon \mathbf{Fields} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
$$

given [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_n$ then choice of [[complex structure]] on $\Sigma_n$ supposed to naturally induced complex structure on space of (on-shell) fields over $\Sigma_n$

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_n)
$$

Moreover, [[transgression]] of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S)$ to $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma)$ is supposed to yield a [[holomorphic line bundle]] with connection with respect to that complex structure

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\Sigma_n))
  \colon
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_n)
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} 
  \,.
$$

This is the [[prequantum line bundle]] of the Chern-Simons theory, already equipped with a [[Kähler polarization]].

Accordingly, the [[geometric quantization]] of the CS action functional assigns to $\Sigma_n$ the [[Hilbert space]] of holomorphic sections of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\Sigma_n))$.

One such section $\Psi$ is to be singled out. For instance if $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\Sigma_n))$ is a [[theta characteristic]] then there is up to scale a unique holomorphic section.

Holographic interpretation:

the [[field (physics)|fields]] $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_n)$ may also be thought of as the [[sources]] of a (higher) [[gauged WZW model]] on $\Sigma$. The [[holographic principle]] says that $\Psi$ is also the [[generating function]] of the [[WZW model]], meaning that the [[functional derivatives]]

$$
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{i_1}(x_1)}
  \cdots 
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{i_n}(x_n)}
  \Psi
  =
  \langle \phi_{i_1}(x_1) \cdots \phi_{i_n}(x_n) \rangle
$$

are the [[n-point functions]] of the WZW model.
