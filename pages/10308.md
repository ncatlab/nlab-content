## Idea

This entry discusses the [[quantization]] of the [[prequantum field theory|prequantum]] data of standard 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] (induced from a suitable [[Lie group]] and [[invariant polynomial]]/[[second Chern class]] [[action functional]]) to a [[3d TQFT]].

The steps involved in the [[geometric quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] are indicated at _[Chern-Simons theory -- Geometic quantization](Chern-Simons+theory#GeometricQuantization)_.

It was long expected that the resulting [[3d TQFT]] is that given by the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]], which is a kind of state sum model that produces an [[FQFT]] from the data of a [[modular tensor category]], such as the category of [[positive energy representations]] of the [[loop group]] of $G$, or else of a [[quantum group]]. 

More recently all the ingredients of a proof that this is indeed equivalently the result of the [[geometric quantization]] are appearing ([Andersen 12](#Andersen12)). See also ([MO discussion](#MODiscussion)).

## General idea
 {#GeneralIdea}

> under construction

There are plenty of technical details involved in the quantization of Chern-Simons theory and all that is subsumed by it (such as the [[Wilson loop]] [[quantum observables]] and the [[Jones polynomial]] [[knot invariants]] they gives rise to, and such as the [[WZW model]], its [[modular functor]] and the [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] that it induces), but there is also a neat general story controlling it. Here we try to sketch that general story at a rough level in order to provide orientation.

### Space of Chern-Simons quantum states 

Chern-Simons [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S_{CS}) \colon \mathbf{Fields}_{CS} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
$$

given a [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_n$ then choice of [[complex structure]] $\mathbf{\Sigma}_n$ on $\Sigma_n$ is supposed to naturally induce a [[complex structure]] on the space of (on-shell) fields over $\Sigma_n$

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n)
$$

Moreover, [[transgression]] of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S)$ to $\mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\Sigma)$ is supposed to yield a [[holomorphic line bundle]] with connection with respect to that complex structure

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n))
  \colon
  \mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n)
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} 
  \,.
$$

This is the [[prequantum line bundle]] of the Chern-Simons theory, already equipped with a [[Kähler polarization]].

Accordingly, the [[geometric quantization]] of the CS action functional assigns to $\Sigma_n$ the [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{\Sigma}}$ of holomorphic sections of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n))$.

As the complex structure $\mathbf{\Sigma}_n$ on $\Sigma_n$ varies over the [[moduli stack of complex structures]] $\mathcal{M}_{\Sigma}$, these vector spaces $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{\Sigma}_n}$ form a [[vector bundle]] with projective flat connection (the _[[Hitchin connection]]_) on the moduli stack

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{H}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathcal{M}_{\Sigma}
  }
$$

The assignment

$$
  \Sigma_n \mapsto \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma}
$$

natural in [[diffeomorphisms]] of $\Sigma$ is called the _[[modular functor]]_, this we focus on more [below](#ModularFunctorAndEquivariantEllipticCohomology)


One such section $\Psi$ is to be singled out. For instance if $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\Sigma_n))$ is a [[theta characteristic]] then there is up to scale a unique holomorphic section. This singling-out is formalized by the [[FRS-formalism]]. See there for more.

### Space of WZW-model pre-correlators 

Under the [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]] the states of Chern-Simons theory also correspond to [[partition functions]] of the [[gauged WZW model]] and hence to [[generating functions]] for [[correlation functions]] of the actual [[WZW model]].

The [[field (physics)|fields]] $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_n)$ may also be thought of as the [[sources]] of a (higher) [[gauged WZW model]] on $\Sigma$. 

The [[holographic principle]] says that the [[quantum state]]/[[wavefunction]] 

$$
  \Psi \in \Gamma(\mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n), L)
$$ 

is also the [[generating function]] for the [[correlators]] of the [[WZW model]] on $\Sigma_n$, meaning that its [[functional derivatives]] 

+-- {: bluebox}

$$
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{a_1}(z_1)}
  \cdots 
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{a_n}(z_n)}
  \Psi
  =
  \left\langle J^{a_1}(z_1) \cdots J^{a_n}(z_n) \right\rangle
$$

with respect to the Chern-Simons-[[field (physics)|fields]], hence the WZW [[sources]],  are the [[n-point functions]] of the WZW model for [[current algebra]] insertions, as indicated

### Modular functor and equivariant elliptic cohomology
 {#ModularFunctorAndEquivariantEllipticCohomology}

Side remark: discussion of [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] (see there ar _[interpretation in QFT](equivariant+elliptic+cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_) says that this construction refines from equipping $\Sigma$ with [[complex structure]] to equipping it with [[arithmetic geometry|arithmetic structure]]. Hence for $\Sigma$ a [[torus]] it refines from structures of [[elliptic curves]] over the complex numbers to general arithmetic elliptic curves (over the [[integers]]) and in fact to [[derived elliptic curves]] (over the [[sphere spectrum]]). Hence eventually the theory of [[geometric quantization]] needs to be refined to admit [[polarizations]] in [[arithmetic geometry]]. See at _[[differential cohesion and idelic structure]]_ for more on this.
