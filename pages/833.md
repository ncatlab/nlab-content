## Idea

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$1$-groupoid__ is an $\infty$-groupoid such that all [[parallel pair]]s of $j$-morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $j \geq 2$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $1$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $1$-morphisms are equivalent. If you rephrase equivalence of $1$-morphisms as [[equality]], which gives the same result up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], then all that is left in this definition is a [[groupoid]].  Thus one may also say that a __$1$-groupoid__ is simply a groupoid.

The point of all this is simply to fill in the general concept of $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoid]]; nobody thinks of $1$-groupoids as a concept in their own right except simply as groupoids.  Compare $1$-[[1-category|category]] and $1$-[[1-poset|poset]], which are defined on the same basis.
