## Idea

An _$n$-symplectic manifold_ is to an ordinary [[symplectic manifold]] as an [[L-infinity algebroid|Lie n-algebroid]] is to an ordinary [[manifold]].

## Definition

Traditionally, $n$-symplectic manifolds are thought of as [[supermanifold]]s with extra structure. More particularly, as [[NQ-supermanifold]]s with extra structure. 

One can argue that a more conceptual way to talk about them is in terms of [[Lie ∞-algebroid]]s. Technically it means precisely the same thing, but amplifying the [[Lie theory]] context should be helpful.

### In supermanifold language 

An $n$-symplectic manifold is a [[NQ-supermanifold]] $X$ with an  $\mathbb{N}$-graded symplectic form $\omega$ of grading-degree $n$.

So $\omega$ is a closed nondegenerate [[super differential form]] that respects the $\mathbb{N}$-refined grading of the underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-garded [[supermanifold]] as indicated.

### In $\infty$-Lie algebroid language 

An $n$-symplectic manifold is a [[Lie ∞-algebroid]] $\mathcal{a}$ equipped with a choice of binary degree $(n+2)$ [[invariant polynomial]] $\omega \in inv(\mathcal{a})$. More on this is at [[schreiber:symplectic ∞-Lie algebroid]].



## Examples

### $n=0$: symplectic manifold

In [[NQ-supermanifold]] language:

the 2-form being of degree 0 means that only vector fields along degree 0 coordinates may be sent to non-vanishing values. Hence for the form to be non-degenerate, there may not be any higher degree coordinates, hence the NQ-supermanifold must be an ordinary manifold. On that the 2-form is then a closed non-degenerate 2-form, hence a symplectic form.

A $0$-symplectic manifold is an ordinary [[symplectic manifold]].

### $n=1$: Poisson manifold 

A $1$-symplectic manifold is, as a 1-[[Lie algebroid]], necessarily a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]]. As such it is equivalently encoded in an ordinary [[Poisson manifold]].

Regarded as a [[Lie algebroid]], it should by [[Lie integration]] integrate to a [[Lie groupoid]] with extra structure. These are the [[symplectic groupoid]]s.

### $n=2$: Courant algebroid

A $2$-symplectic manifold encodes and is encoded by the structure of a [[Courant algebroid]].

Recall from the discussion there that one incarnation of this [[Courant algebroid]] is as a [[L-infinity algebra|Lie 3-algebra]]. If the base manifold is a point, then this is the [[String Lie 2-algebra]].

## Relation to multisymplectic geometry

There is also the closely related notion  of [[multisymplectic geometry]]. See 

* [[John Baez]], [[Chris Rogers]], _Categorified Symplectic Geometry and the String Lie 2-Algebra_, ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4721))

for some relations of this to the above situation for $n = 2$. Essentially multisymplectic geometry studies the higher $n$-ary brackets induced from the binary graded symplectic form discussed here. The relation between these two pictures is the same as that between as studied in the context of [[hemistrict Lie 2-algebra]]s.

An article with more details on this:

* [[Chris Rogers]], _Courant algebroids from categorified symplectic geometry_ ([pdf](http://math.ucr.edu/~chris/2plectic-algebroid_DRAFT.pdf)).


## References

The notion originates somewhere in the school of [[Alan Weinstein]]'s school of [[higher category theory|higher categorial]] [[symplectic geometry]]. The first published appearance of the notion at least for $0 \leq n \leq 3$ is

A good writeup of this material is in

The idea for all $n$ was then sketched, together with many other ideas about [[L-infinity algebroid]]s in the article with the nice title

What we call $n$-symplectic manifold here is called $\Sigma_n$-manifold there.

> [[Urs Schreiber]]: I find $\Sigma_n$ too undescriptive. But logically I should then be speaking of _$n$-Poisson manifolds_ so that for $n=1$ we get the ordinary version, not for $n=0$. But I find _symplectic_ still much nicer descriptive than "Poisson", so the above choice of terminology follows aesthetics a little bit more than established terminology. But only slightly. Only by a difference of 1.

> _Toby_:  What if you changed the numbering by $1$?  Must your $n$ match the $n$ in $\Sigma_n$?

> Urs: I thought of that, but then I found it weird to have a numbering system that claims that ordinary Poisson geometry is a "2-" and hence supposed a categorified thing. In $\Sigma_n$-terminology the $n$ is indeed the degree of the Lie n-algebroid. That seems worthwhile to keep.
