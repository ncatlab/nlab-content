## Statement

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]] and $H \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} G$ a [[subgroup]]-inclusion. Then the [[induced representation]] in [[representation category|Rep(G)]] of the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1} \in Rep(H)$ is the [[permutation representation]] $k[G/H]$ of the [[coset]] [[G-set]] $G/H$:

$$
  \mathrm{ind}_H^G\big( \mathbf{1}\big)
  \;\simeq\;
  k[G/H]
  \,.
$$ 

This follows directly as a special case of the general formula for [[induced representations]] of [[finite groups]] ([this Example](induced+representation#InductionOfFiniteDimensionalRepresentationsOfFiniteGroups)).

It follows that every [[virtual representation|virtual]] [[permutation representation]] (hence every element of the [[representation ring]] $R_k(G)$ in the [[image]] of the canonical morphism $A(G) \overset{\beta}{\to} R_k(G)$ from the [[Burnside ring]]) is a virtual combination of induced representations of trivial representations. 

A generalization of this statement including non-permutation representations is the [[Brauer induction theorem]].
