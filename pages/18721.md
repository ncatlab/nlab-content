## Idea 

Where the [[homotopy hypothesis]] is the assertion that [[∞-groupoids]] are equivalent to [[topological spaces]] (considered modulo [[weak homotopy equivalence]]), in [AFR15](#AFR15) the authors construct an equivalence for [[(∞,1)-categories]]. They do so in terms of what are called **striation sheaves**, which are sheaves on conically smooth [[poset-stratified space|stratified spaces]] satisfying a certain [[descent]] condition.

The construction relies on a fully faithful embedding of conically smooth stratified spaces, and conically smooth maps among them, into $(\infty, 1)$-categories via the exit-path functor, which maps stratified spaces to paths within them that once they leave a stratum do not re-enter it.
