## Idea

For $X$ a [[filtered object|filtered]] [[space]] entities like [[quasicoherent sheaves]] over $X$ get induced a filtering by their [[support]] on the [[strata]] of $X$.

## Examples

* The [[height filtration]] on the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] induces a filtration by suppert. The corresponding [[spectral sequence of a filtered stable homotopy type]] appears
