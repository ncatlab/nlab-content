An __automorphism__ of an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[isomorphism]] $f : x \to x$.  In other words, an automorphism is an [[isomorphism]] that is an [[endomorphism]].

Given an object $x$, the automorphisms of $x$ form a [[group]] under [[composition]], the __automorphism group__ of $x$, which is a submonoid of the [[endomorphism monoid]] of $x$:
$$
  Aut_C(x) = End_C(x) \cap Iso(C) = Iso_C(x,x)
,$$
which may be written $Aut(x)$ if the category $C$ is understood.  Up to equivalence, every group is an automorphism group; see [[delooping]].
