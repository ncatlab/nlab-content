This entry is about the article

* [[Mike Hopkins]], I. Singer, [[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology,and M-Theory]] ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0211216))

on [[differential cohomology]], higher [[gauge field]]s appearing in [[string theory]] and their [[quantum anomaly|quantum anomalies]].

Motivated by attempting to fully formalize [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]]-type [[quantum anomaly]] problems previously studied by [[Edward Witten]], this article introduced a systematic general definition for the refinement of any [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory to [[differential cohomology]], the context for higher [[gauge field]]s in physics. 

The connecton of this work to the physics of the [[electromagnetic field]] and of higher [[gauge field]]s in  [[string theory]] was later developed further notably in

* [[Dan Freed]], _Dirac charge quantization and generalized differential cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011220)).

To this date generalized [[differential cohomology]] theories keep being studied mostly with motivation from [[string theory]], but the work of Hopkins and Singer has put this subject on solid mathematical ground, and an independent mathematical field of differential cohomology is developing since then. See the list of references at [[differential cohomology]].
