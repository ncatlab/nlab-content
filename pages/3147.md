This entry is about the article

* [[Mike Hopkins]], [[Isadore Singer]], _Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology,and M-Theory_  J. Differential Geom. Volume 70, Number 3 (2005), 329-452.  ([journal](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1143642908), [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0211216))

which discusses [[differential cohomology]] and uses it to study [[quadratic refinements]] of [[intersection pairing]] $(x,y) \mapsto \int_\Sigma x \cup y$ in [[cohomology]]. This is motivated from and related to the [[physics]] of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] appearing in [[string theory]] and the corresponding [[quantum anomaly|quantum anomalies]].

The article introduces a systematic general definition for the refinement of any [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory to [[differential cohomology]] (the context for higher [[gauge field]]s in physics) in terms of [[differential function complex]]es. 

In this construction continuous classifying maps from a [[smooth manifold]] into a [[spectrum]] [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] the given [[cohomology]] are equipped with smooth [[differential form]]s that have under the [[de Rham theorem]] the same class in real cohomology as the pullback along the classifying map of a collection of given real cocycles on the spectrum.

The connecton of this work to the physics of the [[electromagnetic field]] and of higher [[gauge field]]s in  [[string theory]] was later developed further notably in

* [[Dan Freed]], _Dirac charge quantization and generalized differential cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011220)).

To this date generalized [[differential cohomology]] theories keep being studied mostly with motivation from [[string theory]], but the work of Hopkins and Singer has put this subject on solid mathematical ground, and an independent mathematical field of differential cohomology is developing since then. See the list of references at [[differential cohomology]].
