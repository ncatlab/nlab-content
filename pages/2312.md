## Idea

A [[cohomology theory]] $E$ is called _multiplicative_ if $E^\bullet(X)$ is not just a [[graded module|graded]] [[abelian group]], but actually a graded [[ring]].

## Definition

A _multiplicative structure_ on a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is the structure of a [[ring spectrum]] on the [[spectrum]] that [[Brown representability theorem|represents]] it.

e.g. [Lurie 10, lecture 4](#Lurie10)

In particular every [[E-âˆž ring]] is a [[ring spectrum]], hence represents a multiplicative cohomology theory, but the converse is in general false.

## Examples

* [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in a [[ring]], in particular [[integral cohomology]]

* [[topological K-theory]], [[K-theory]]

* [[cobordism cohomology theory]]

* [[tmf]]

* etc....
