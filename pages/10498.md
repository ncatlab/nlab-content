# The polarization identity

## Idea

Any [[symmetric bilinear form]] $(-) \cdot (-)$ defines a [[quadratic form]] $(-)^2$.  The polarization identity reconstructs the bilinear form from the quadratic form.  More generally, starting from any [[bilinear form]], the polarization identity reconstructs its symmetrization.  A slight variation applies this also to [[sesquilinear form]]s.  The whole business actually applies to [[bilinear maps]], not just forms (that is, taking arbitrary values, not just values in the [[base field]] or some other [[line]]).  The linearity is crucial: polarization doesn\'t work without addition (and subtraction); we must also be able to divide by $2$.


## Statement

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]].  Let $V$ and $W$ be $R$-[[modules]], and let $m\colon V \times V \to W$ be a [[bilinear map]]; that is, we have an $R$-module [[homomorphism]] $V \otimes V \to W$.  Let $Q\colon V \to W$ be the [[quadratic map]] given by $Q(v) = m(v,v)$; this is *not* an $R$-module homomorphism.

Then we have:

* the _[[parallelogram law]]_: $2 Q(x) + 2 Q(y) = Q(x + y) + Q(x - y)$, and
* the __polarization identity__: $2 m(x,y) + 2 m(y,x) = Q(x + y) - Q(x - y)$.

Writing $Q(x)$ as $x^2$ and $m(x,y)$ as $x y$, these read:

* $2 x^2 + 2 y^2 = (x +y )^2 + (x - y)^2$,
* $2 x y + 2 y x = (x + y)^2 - (x - y)^2$.

The polarization identity also has these alternative forms:

* $x y + y x = (x + y)^2 - x^2 - y^2$,
* $x y + y x = x^2 + y^2 - (x - y)^2$;

these may derived by adding or subtracting the parallelogram law and the first polarization identity; although the derivation requires cancelling $2$, the alternative polarization identities remain valid regardless of whether $2$ is cancellable in $W$.

Now suppose that $m$ is [[symmetric bilinear map|symmetric]], so that $x y = y x$.  And suppose that $2 \coloneqq 1 + 1$ is (not merely cancellable but also) invertible in $W$.  Then the polarization identities read:

* $x y = \frac{1}{4} (x + y)^2 - \frac{1}{4} (x - y)^2$,
* $x y = \frac{1}{2} (x + y)^2 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 - \frac{1}{2} y^2$,
* $x y = \frac{1}{2} x^2 + \frac{1}{2} y^2 - \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2$;

That is, we may recover $m$ from $Q$ (in any of these ways).  Regardless of the original symmetry of $m$, we may recover its symmetrization $x \circ y = (x y + y x)/2$.

We can go the other direction: given a quadratic map $Q$, if $2$ is invertible, then any polarization identity defines a symmetric bilinear map $m$; these all agree if $Q$ obeys the parallelogram law, and then $Q$ may be recovered from this $m$ once more.

If $R$ is a $*$-[[star-ring|ring]], then $m$ could be conjugate-symmetric ([[Hermitian map|Hermitian]]).  Then $Q$ would satisfy $Q(t x) = t^* t Q(x)$ instead of $Q(t x) = t^2 Q(x)$ as for a quadratic map.  Since everything is still bilinear or quadratic over the [[integers]], the parallelogram identity still follows, as does the polarization identity in its general forms (before assuming that $m$ is symmetric).  We can still recover $m$ from $Q$ if $R$ has an [[imaginary unit]]: an element $i$ such that $i + i^* = 0$ and $i i^* = 1$; we do this as follows:
$$ x y = \frac{1}{4} Q(x + y) - \frac{1}{4} Q(x - y) + \frac{1}{4} i Q(x + i y) - \frac{1}{4} i Q(x - i y) .$$


## Examples

This is best known in the case of bilinear and quadratic *forms*, where $W$ is the [[ground ring]] $R$.  Here, $m$ is an [[inner product]], making $V$ into an [[inner product space]], and $Q$ is (the square of) the norm, making $V$ into a [[normed space]].

This also applies to [[commutative algebras]], where $W$ is $V$.  Actually, there is no need for $m$ to be associative; although one rarely studies commutative but [[non-associative algebras]], we have an exception with [[Jordan algebras]].  Although the Jordan identity is simpler to express in terms of the multiplication operation (as usual), the application to [[quantum mechanics]] may be more easily motivated through the squaring operation (since the square of an [[observable]] has a more obvious meaning than the Jordan product of two observables), and the polarization identities allow us to recover multiplication from squaring.
