This is one of the most influential and comprehensive historical books in "formal" low-dimensional higher category theory:

* John W. Gray, Formal category theory: adjointness for $2$-categories. Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 391. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-New York, 1974. xii+282 pp.

The book was supposed to be the first part of a four volume work, but unfortunately later volumes/chapters never appeared. It has some parts of 2- and 3-category theory; including the treatment of the famous [[Gray tensor product]] on 2-Cat. See also [[Gray-category]].
