## Definition


A __cogenerator__ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] $S$ such that the [[functor]] $h_S = C(-,S) : C^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{Set}$ is [[faithful functor|faithful]]. This means that for any pair $g_1,g_2\in C(X,Y)$, if they are indistinguishable by morphisms to $S$ in the sense that
$$ \forall (\theta: Y \to S),\; \theta \circ g_1 = \theta \circ g_2 ,$$
then $g_1 = g_2$.

One often extends this notion to a __cogenerating family__ of objects, which is a (usually [[small category|small]]) set $\mathcal{S} = \lbrace S_a, a\in A\rbrace$ of objects in $C$ such that the family $C(-,S_a)$ is jointly faithful. This means that for any pair $g_1,g_2\in C(X,Y)$, if they are indistinguishable by morphisms to $\mathcal{S}$ in the sense that
$$ \forall (a: A),\; \forall (\theta: Y \to S_a),\; \theta \circ g_1 = \theta \circ g_2 ,$$
then $g_1 = g_2$.



## Examples

In [[Set]], the set of [[truth value]]s is a cogenerator.  More generally, in any [[well-pointed topos]], the [[subobject classifier]] is a cogenerator. 

Much more generally, we have

###### Proposition 
Every [[topos]] with a [[size issues|small set]] of [[separator|generators]] (e.g., a well-pointed topos, or a Grothendieck topos), and that has [[products]] of objects indexed over sets no larger in [[cardinality]] than the generating set, admits an [[injective object|injective]] cogenerator.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $C$ be a set of generators for the topos; as usual, let $\Omega$ be the subobject classifier. We claim that a product 

$$\prod_{c \in C} \Omega^c$$ 

is a cogenerator. For suppose $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y$ are distinct morphisms. The contravariant power object functor $\Omega^-$ is faithful (a familiar fact, since it is [[monadic functor|monadic]]), so that $\Omega^f, \Omega^g: \Omega^Y \stackrel{\to}{\to} \Omega^X$ are distinct. Since the objects $c$ form a [[separator|generating set]], there is some $h \colon c \to \Omega^Y$ such that the composites 

$$c \stackrel{h}{\to} \Omega^Y \stackrel{\overset{\Omega^f}{\to}}{\underset{\Omega^g}{\to}} \Omega^X$$ 

are distinct. The map $h$ may be transformed to a map $\tilde{h}: Y \to \Omega^c$, and it follows that the two composites 

$$X \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\to}} Y \stackrel{\tilde{h}}{\to} \Omega^c$$ 

are distinct. For any other $c' \in C$, we may uniformly define $Y \to \Omega^{c'}$ to be the map classifying the maximal [[subobject]] of $c' \times Y$, so that these maps together with $\tilde{h}$ collectively induce a map 

$$Y \to \prod_{c \in C} \Omega^c$$ 

that yields distinct results when composed with $f$ and $g$. This proves the claim. 

The object $\prod \Omega^c$ is injective because already $\Omega$ is injective (see Mac Lane-Moerdijk, IV.10), and it is a general fact that in a [[cartesian closed category]] (or more generally a [[closed monoidal category]]), an exponential (or internal Hom) $X^Y$ whose base $X$ is injective is also injective, and products of injective objects are injective.

Notice also that the existence of a small (co)generating family is one of the conditions in one version of the [[adjoint functor theorem]]. We may conclude, for example, that [[Grothendieck toposes]] are cototal (q.v.). 

##Terminology

The concept of _cogenerator_ is dual to that of [[separator]], so it can also be referred to as a _coseparator_.
