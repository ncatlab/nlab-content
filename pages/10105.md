## Idea

A compact closed 2-category (also called an *autonomous* symmetric monoidal 2-category) is the (weak) [[2-category]]-analog of the notion of _[[compact closed category]]_.  That is, it is a [[symmetric monoidal 2-category]] in which all objects have duals.

## Examples

1. For $V$ a cocomplete [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], the bicategory $V Prof$ of small $V$-[[enriched categories]] and $V$-enriched [[profunctors]] is compact closed.  ([Day-Street](#DayStreet))

1. For $C$ a [[2-category]] with weak [[finite limits]], the [[(infinity,n)-category of spans|2-category of spans]] in $C$ is compact closed. ([Stay 13](#Stay13))

## Internalization

In line with the [[microcosm principle]], internal to a compact closed 2-category one can define a notion of *compact closed [[bicategory of maps|map]] [[pseudomonoid]]*, which specializes in $V Prof$ (at least in the [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy complete]] case) to the usual notion of [[compact closed category|compact closed]] $V$-category.  ([Day-Street](#DayStreet))  To deal with non-Cauchy complete categories, one can instead talk about compact closed [[proarrow equipments]].
