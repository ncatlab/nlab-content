A category of _pure motives_ is informally a certain linearization or [[additive and abelian categories|abelianization]] of a category of (say smooth projective) algebraic varieties over a field.

THE FOLLOWING IS NOT A DEFINITION, just a rough description of steps which require lots of further details to become a definition.

Given an [[adequate equivalence relation]] for algebraic cycles (the typical 4 choices are the rational, numerical, algebraic and homological equivalences), one constructs a version of [[Chow ring]]s, or what is axiomatically called a [[Weyl cohomology theory]] for varieties; the treatment of adequate relations typically involves a nontrivial tool, the so called [[Chow moving lemma]]. To define the category of __effective pure motives__, one starts with the category of smooth varieties over a field $k$, then enlarges the hom-sets between any two objects $X,Y$ by including a linear version of [[span|correspondence]]s, which are roughly the Chow cohomology classes of cycles on $X\times Y$. This gives an [[additive category]]; its [[Karoubian category|Karoubian envelope]] with formally inverted [[Lefschetz motive]] is the category of effective pure motives over $k$. The Lefschetz motive is inverted in order to make the tensor category of motives [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]].
