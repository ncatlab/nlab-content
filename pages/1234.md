## Idea

[[Grothendieck]] conjectured that every [[Weil cohomology theory]] factors uniquely through some [[category]], which he called the category of _[[motives]]_.  For [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]] (over some [[field]] $k$) such a category was given by Grothendieck himself, called the category of _pure [[Chow motives]]_.  For general smooth varieties the category is still conjectural, see at _[[mixed motives]]_.

## Construction

Fix some [[adequate equivalence relation]] $\sim$ (e.g. [[rational equivalence]]).  Let $Z^i(X)$ denote the group of $i$-codimensional [[algebraic cycles]] and let $A^i_\sim(X)$ denote the quotient $Z^i(X)/\sim$.

### Category of correspondences  

Let $Corr_\sim(k)$, the category of [[correspondences]], be the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]] and whose [[hom-sets]] are the [[direct sum]]

$$
  Corr_\sim(h(X),h(Y)) = \bigoplus_i A^{n_i}_\sim(X_i \times Y)
  \,,
$$

where $(X_i)$ are the [[irreducible components]] of $X$ and $n_i$ are their respective [[dimensions]].  The [[composition]] of two [[morphisms]] $\alpha \in Corr(X,Y)$ and $\beta \in Corr(Y,Z)$ is given by
$$ p_{XZ,*} (p_{XY}^*(\alpha) . p_{YZ}^*(\beta)) $$
where $p_{XY}$ denotes the projection $X \times Y \times Z \to X \times Y$ and so on, and $.$ denotes the [[intersection product]] in $X \times Y \times Z$.

There is a canonical [[contravariant functor]] 

$$
  h \colon SmProj(k) \to Corr_\sim(k)
$$ 

from the category of smooth projective varieties over $k$ given by mapping $X \mapsto X$ and a morphism $f : X \to Y$ to its [[graph of a function|graph]], the [[image]] of its [[graph morphism]] $\Gamma_f : X \to X \times Y$. 

The category of correspondences is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] with $h(X) \otimes h(Y) \coloneqq h(X \times Y)$.

We also define a category $Corr_\sim(k, A)$ of correspondences with [[coefficients]] in some [[commutative ring]] $A$, by [[tensor product|tensoring]] the morphisms with $A$; this is an $A$-[[linear category]] [[additive category|additive]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] category.

### Category of effective pure motives  

The [[Karoubi envelope]] (pseudo-abelianisation) of $Corr_\sim(k, A)$ is called the category of **effective pure motives** (with coefficients in $A$ and with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$), denoted $Mot^eff_\sim(k, A)$.  

Explicitly its objects are pairs $(h(X), p)$ with $X$ a smooth projective variety and $p \in Corr(h(X), h(X))$ an [[idempotent]], and morphisms from $(h(X), p)$ to $(h(Y), q)$ are morphisms $h(X) \to h(Y)$ in $Corr_\sim$ of the form $q \circ \alpha \circ p$ with $\alpha \in Corr_{\sim}(h(X), h(Y))$.

This is still a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] category with $(h(X), p) \otimes (h(Y), q) = (h(X \times Y), p \times q)$.  Further it is [[Karoubian category|Karoubian]], $A$-[[linear category|linear]] and [[additive category|additive]].

The image of $X \in SmProj(k)$ under the above functor 

$$
  h \colon SmProj(k) \to Corr_\sim(k,A) \to Mot^{eff}_\sim(k,A) 
$$

is the **the motive of $X$**.

### Category of pure motives  

There exists a motive $\mathbf{L}$, called the **[[Lefschetz motive]]**, such that the motive of the [[projective line]] decomposes as

$$h(\mathbf{P}^1_k) = h(\Spec(k)) \oplus \mathbf{L}$$

To get a [[rigid category]] we formally invert the Lefschetz motive and get a category 

$$
  Mot_\sim(k, A)
  \coloneqq
  Mot^{eff}_\sim(k,A)[\mathbf{L}^{-1}]
  \,,
$$ 

the **category of pure motives** (with coefficients in $A$ and with respect to $\sim$).  

This is a [[rigid category|rigid]], [[Karoubian category|Karoubian]], [[symmetric monoidal category]].  Its objects are triples $(h(X), p, n)$ with $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.

### Category of pure Chow motives

When the relation $\sim$ is [[rational equivalence]] then $A^*_\sim$ are the [[Chow groups]], and $Mot_\sim(k) = Mot_{rat}(k)$ is called the category of **pure [[Chow motives]]**.


### Category of pure numerical motives

When the relation $\sim$ is numerical equivalence, then one obtains
_[[numerical motives]]_.
