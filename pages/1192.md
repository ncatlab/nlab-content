In any [[well-order]]ed set $S$, a successor $w+1$ of an element $w$ is the smallest element of the subset of all elements which are bigger than $w$. If $S$ has no maximal element the successor map $w\mapsto w+1$ is well defined; it is sometimes used to make recursive definitions. 

This notion is sometimes also used for some well-ordered proper classes, for example for the class $\mathbf{Ord}$ of [[ordinal]]s. For definitions by transfinite recursion one needs to specify the value at $0$, the rule for recursion along the successor map and a separate rule of recursion for 
the limiting ordinals (infinite ordinals which are not successors). For example, the von Neumann universe of well-founded sets is defined in that way.

In a topos, a [[natural numbers object]] $\mathbb{N}$ is equipped with a successor morphism $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$;
and it has an abstract property of recursion.
