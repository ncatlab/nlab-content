A [[Vect]]-[[enriched category]] with [[direct sum]]s is _semisimple_ if each object is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum]] of finitely many [[simple object]]s.


#Definition#


A linear [[monoidal category]] (that is, a [[monoidal category]] [[enriched category|enriched over]] [[Vect]]) is called _semisimple_ if:
*  it has finite [[biproduct]]s (usually called '[[direct sum]]s'),
*  [[split idempotent|idempotents split]] (so we say that it 'has [[subobject]]s' or, perhaps better, 'has [[retract]]s'), and

   What does it mean to 'have subobjects'?  (I assume that the 'direct sums' are [[biproduct]]s.)  ---Toby

   have subobjects = idempotents split and yes, finite biproducts. Simple objects are ones in which End(X) = k. 

   [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: shouldn't we say something like: a category is semisimple if each object is a direct sum of finitely many simple objects?

   [[Bruce Bartlett|Bruce]]: Urs, you're right, and that's indeed the way one morally thinks about it, but it's a less canonical way of proceeding. We ask ourselves: given a linear category with direct sums and subobjects, and a chosen maximal collection $\{X_i\}$ of nonisomorphic simple objects, how can we check if its semisimple? In the one way, we have to check whether a certain canonically defined map is an isomorphism. In the other way, we have to check if each object $V$ can be expressed as a direct sum of the $X_i$'s. Actually finding such a decomposition would be a noncanonical operation. So your shorter more snappy definition would force an auditor to perform an evil thing if he actually wanted to check it :-) It's that old thing about "only that part of a representation which behaves like an irreducible $\rho$ is canonical, the actual break-down of that rep into direct sums of $\rho$'s is noncanonical". That is, what is canonical is $Hom(V, X_i)$ and not $V = \bigoplus_i n_i X_i$.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: okay, so it seems you are saying "eacxh object being finite direct sum of simples" is the right _idea_, while the _right definition_ is a bit different. Sounds good to me. So I have now created above a section "Idea" and put the former statement there. (Every entry should start with an "Idea"-section!) Then I created a section headline _Definition_ for the present bit. Just a suggestion. See how you like it.

*  there exist [[object]]s $X_i$ labeled by an index set $I$ such that $Hom(X_i, X_j) \cong \delta_{ij} k$ where $k$ is the ground field (such objects are called _simple_) and such that for any two objects $V$ and $W$ in the category, the natural composition map
   \[
     \bigoplus_{i \in I} Hom(V, X_i) \otimes Hom(X_i, W) \rightarrow Hom(V, W)
   \]
   is an isomorphism.

For instance, the category of [[representation theory|representation]]s of a compact Lie group $G$ is semisimple, with the simple objects being precisely the irreducible representations (this is the content of Schur's lemma). If $G$ is noncompact, one needs to pass from the concept of 'direct sum' to '[[direct integral]]'.

_Bruce_: This definition of semisimple (taken from the reference of Mueger below) does not use the concept of 'abelian category'. This is because the concepts that one thinks about with abelian categories such as kernels and cokernels do not play an important conceptual role in semisimple categories, being replaced by the more important concepts of 'direct sum' and 'subobject' . Hence it is best to give a streamlined definition from first principles without going through the language of abelian categories which would have muddied the waters.
