A **multiplicative system** in a [[ring]] $R$ is a set $S\subset R$ which is a [[monoid|submonoid]] of the multiplicative monoid of $R$, i.e. $1\in S$ and if $a,b\in S$ then $a b\in S$.

If $R$ is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then a multiplicative system is precisely what is necessary to construct the [[localization]] $R[S^{-1}]$ as formal 'fractions' in $R$.  If $R$ is an [[integral domain]], and $S=R\setminus \{0\}$, then $R[S^{-1}]$ is its [[field]] of fractions.

If $R$ is not commutative, then one generally needs extra conditions, such as the [[Ore condition]], in order to construct a localization.

The term 'multiplicative system' is also sometimes used for a set of morphisms in a category admitting a [[calculus of fractions]].
