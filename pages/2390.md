## Idea

The notion of _epipresheaf_ is formally dual to the more standard notion of  [[separated presheaf]]: where the latter has a [[monomorphism]], the former has an [[epimorphism]].

From this perspective a [[sheaf]] is a [[presheaf]] satisfying two properties: the epipresheaf condition and the "[[monopresheaf]]" (or [[separated presheaf]]) condition. Thus there are epipresheaves, monopresheaves and sheaves.

## Definition

A presheaf $A$ is called _epipresheaf_ if for any [[local isomorphism]] $f:X\to Y$ the map $A(Y)\to A(X)$ is an [[epimorphism]]
