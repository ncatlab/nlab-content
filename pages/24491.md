## Idea

In a [[field]] of [[positive characteristic]], the usual derivative of polynomials has bad properties. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be such a field of characteristic $p \gt 0$. Consider the polynomial algebra $\mathbb{K}[X]$. The usual derivative of polynomials in one indeterminate defines a [[derivation]] $\mathbb{K}[X] \rightarrow \mathbb{K}[X]$ which associates $P'$ to $P$.

We then have that $(X^{p})'=p.X^{p-1}=0$ but $X^{p} \neq 0$ because $1^{p} = 1 \neq 0$. We thus lack the property that $P' = 0$ iff $P$ is a constant.

The notion of Hasse-Schmidt derivative comes as a replacement of the usual derivative and enjoys better properties.

It seems very linked to [[differential linear logic]] and the new notion of [[graded bialgebras]].
