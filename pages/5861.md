## Idea

A [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is a context of [[∞-groupoid]]s that are equipped with a [[geometry|geometric]] notion of _cohesion_ on their collections of [[object]]s and [[k-morphism]]s, for instance [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoid|topological cohesion]] or [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth cohesion]].

While the axioms of cohesion do imply the intrinsic existence of _exponentiated_ [[infinitesimal space]]s, they do not admit access to an explicit [[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]] notion of infinitesimal extension. 

Here we consider one extra axiom on a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] that does imply a good intrinsic notion of synthetic differential extension, compatible with the given notion of cohesion. We speak of _infinitesimal cohesion_ .

In a cohesion $(\infty,1)$-topos with infinitesimal cohesion there are for instance good intrinsic notions of [[formally smooth morphism|formal smoothness]] and of [[de Rham space]]s of objects.

## Infinitesimal cohesion

We discuss [[extra structure]] on a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]
that encodes a refinement of the corresponding notion of cohesion to 
_[[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] cohesion_ . More precisely, we consider inclusions
$\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ of cohesive 
$(\infty,1)$-toposes that exhibit the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
as infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhoods of objects in 
$\mathbf{H}$.

### Definition


+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalCohesiveInfTopos}
###### Definition

Given a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ we say that 
an **infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood** of $\mathbf{H}$
is another cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
equipped with an  [[adjoint quadruple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s

$$
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
$$

where $i_!$ is 

* a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] 

* that preserves the [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]].

=--

This definition is an abstraction of similar situations considered in ([SimpsonTeleman](#SimpsonTeleman)) and in [Kontsevich-Rosenberg](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces). See also the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Q-category#InfinitesimalThickening">Infinitesimal thickenings</a> at [[Q-category]].


+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalInclusionIfFullAndFaithful}
###### Observation

This implies that also $i_*$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the characterizaton of full and faithful [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s 
the condition on $i_!$ is equivalent to $i^* i_! \simeq Id$. Since $(i^* i_! \dashv i^* i_*)$ it follows by essential uniqueness of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s that also $i^* i_* \simeq Id$.

=--

+-- {: .num_note}
###### Note

This definition captures the characterization of an [[infinitesimal object]] as having a single [[global element|global point]] surrounded by an infinitesimal neighbourhood: as we shall see in more detail [below](#InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction), the [[(∞,1)-functor]] $i^*$ may be thought of as contracting away any infinitesimal extension of an object. Thus $X$ being an [infinitesimal object](#InfinitesimalObject) amounts to  $i^* X \simeq *$, and the [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor|(∞,1)-adjunction]] $(i_! \dashv i^*)$ then indeed guarantees that $X$ has only a single global point, since 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, X) 
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(i_! *, X) 
      \\
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, i^* X)
      \\
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, *)
      \\
      & \simeq *
 \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodIsOverInfGroupoid}
###### Proposition

The inclusion into the infinitesimal neighbourhood is necessarily
a morphism of [[(∞,1)-topos]]es over [[∞Grpd]].

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{H} && \stackrel{(i^* \dashv i_*)}{\to} && \mathbf{H}_{th}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Gamma}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\Gamma}}
     \\
     && \infty Grpd 
  }
$$

as is the induced geometric morphism
$(i_* \dashv i^!) : \mathbf{H}_{th} \to \mathbf{H}$

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{H}_{th} && \stackrel{(i_* \dashv i^!)}{\to} 
      && \mathbf{H}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Gamma}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\Gamma}}
     \\
     && \infty Grpd 
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover $i_*$ is necessarily a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By essential uniqueness of th [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]]:
In both cases the [[direct image]] functor has as [[left adjoint]]
that preserves the [[terminal object]]. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}_{th}}( i_* X )
    & 
    \simeq
    \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, i_* X)
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}(i^* *, X)
    \\
    & 
    \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, X)
    \\
    & \simeq \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}(X)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Analogously in the second case.

=--


We shall write 

$$
  (\Pi_{inf} \dashv Disc_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  := 
  (i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
$$

so that the [[global section]] geometric moprhism of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ factors as

$$
  (\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \dashv Disc_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \dashv \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}_{th}})
  :
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{inf}}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{\mathbf{H}}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$


Let for the remainder of this section an infinitesimal neighbourhood $\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ be fixed.


### Properties

We give a presentation of classes of infinitesimal neighbourhoods by [[simplicial presheaves]] on suitable [[site]]s.

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalNeighBourhoodSite}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be an [[∞-cohesive site]]. We say a [[site]] $C_{th}$ 

* equipped with a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective embedding]]

  $$
    (i \dashv p) : 
     C \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{p}{\leftarrow}}
    C_{th}
  $$

* such that 

  * $i$ preserves [[pullback]]s along morphisms in [[covering]] families;

  * both $i$ and $p$ send [[covering]] families to covering families;

  * for all $\mathbf{U}$ in $C_{th}$ and covering families $\{U_i \to p(\mathbf{U})\}$ there is a lift through $p$ to a covering family $\{\mathbf{U}_i \to \mathbf{U}\}$

is an **infinitesimal neighbourhood site** of $C$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodFromInfinitesimalSite}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an [[∞-cohesive site]] and  $(i \dashv p) : C \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{p}{\leftarrow}} C_{th}$ an [infinitesimal neighbourhood site](#InfinitesimalNeighBourhoodSite). 

Then the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $C_{th}$ is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos and the restriction $i^*$ along $i$ exhibits it as an [infinitesimal neighbourhood](#InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodIsOverInfGroupoid) of the cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos over $C$.

$$
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{th})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, $i_!$ restricts on representables to the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] factoring through $i$:

$$
  \array{
    C &\hookrightarrow& Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    C_{th} &\hookrightarrow& Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})
  }
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-category]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ by the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localized]] at the [[covering]] [[sieve]] inclusions 

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th}) \simeq
  ([C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{loc})^\circ
$$

(as discussed at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes|models for (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes]]).


Consider the right [[Kan extension]] $Ran_i : [C^{op}, sSet] \to [C_{th}^{op},sSet]$ of [[simplicial presheaves]] along the functor $i$. On an object $K \times D \in C_{th}$ it is given by the [[end]]-expression

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{Ran}_{i} F : \mathbf{K} 
    & \mapsto 
    \int_{U \in C} \mathrm{sSet}( C_{\mathrm{th}}(i(U), \mathbf{K})  , F(U))
    \\
    & \simeq 
    \int_{U \in C} \mathrm{sSet}( C(U, p(\mathbf{K}))  , F(U))
    \\
    & \simeq 
    F(p(\mathbf{K}))
    \\
    & =: (p^* F)(\mathbf{K})
   \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the last step we use the [[Yoneda reduction]]-form of the [[Yoneda lemma]]. 

This shows that the [[right adjoint]] to $(-)\circ i$ is itself given by precomposition with a functor, and hence has itself a further right adjoint, which gives us a total of four [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  [C^{op}, sSet]  
    \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]
  \,.
$$

From this are directly induced the corresponding [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]]s on the global projective and injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  (Lan_i \dashv (-) \circ i) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\underset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-)\circ i \dashv (-) \circ p) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
    {\underset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-) \circ p \dashv Ran_p) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
  \,.
$$

Observe that $Lan_i$, being a left [[Kan extension]], sends representables to representables: we have

$$
  Lan_i C(-,T) :
  \mathbf{K}
  \mapsto
  \int^{U \in C} C_{th}(\mathbf{K}, i(U))
   \cdot C(U,T)
$$

and by [[Yoneda reduction]] (more explicitly: observing that this is equivalently the formula for left [[Kan extension]] of the non-corepresentable $C_{th}(K \times D, i(-)) : C \to sSet$ along the identity functor) this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq C_{th}(\mathbf{K}, i(T))
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] for the above Quillen adjunctions to descend to the Cech-local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] it suffices that the [[right adjoint]]s preserve locally fibrant objects. 

We first check that $(-) \circ i$ sends locally fibrant objects to locally fibrant objects.  

To that end, let $\{U_i \to U\}$ be a [[covering family]] in $C$. Write $\int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} (j(U_{i_0}) \times_{j(U)} j(U_{i_1}) \times_{j(U)} \cdots \times_{j(U)} j(U_k))$ for its [[Cech nerve]], where $j$ denotes the [[Yoneda embedding]]. Recall by the definition of the [[∞-cohesive site]] $C$ that all the [[fiber product]]s of representable presheaves here are again themselves representable, hence $\cdots = \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} (j(U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k))$. This means that the [[left adjoint]] $Lan_i$ preserves not only the [[coend]] and [[tensoring]], but by the remark in the previous paragraph and the assumption that $i$ preserves [[pullback]]s along covers we have that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Lan_i 
    C(\{U_i \to U\})
    & \simeq 
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} Lan_i (j(U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k))    
     \\
     & \simeq
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} 
  j i (U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k)    
    \\
    & \simeq
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} 
  j (i(U_{i_0}) \times_{i(U)} i(U_{i_1}) \times_{i(U)} \cdots \times_{i(U)} i(U_k))      
  \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$ 

By the assumption that $i$ preserves covers, this is the [[Cech nerve]] of a [[covering family]] in $C_{th}$. Therefore for $F \in [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$ fibrant we have for all [[covering]]s $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ that the [[descent]] morphism

$$
  (i^* F)(U) = F(i(U))
   \stackrel{}{\to}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet](C(\{i(U_i)\}), F)
  =
  [C^{op}, sSet](C(\{U_i\}), i^* F)
$$

is a weak equivalence, hence that $i^* F$ is locally fibrant.

To see that $(-) \circ p$ preserves locally fibrant objects, we apply the analogous reasoning after observing that its [[left adjoint]] $(-)\circ i$ preserves all [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s of [[simplicial presheaves]] (as these are computed objectwise) and by observing that for 
$\{\mathbf{U}_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} \mathbf{U}\}$ 
a covering family in $C_{th}$ we have that its image under $(-) \circ i$ is its image under $p$, by the [[Yoneda lemma]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     [C^{op}, sSet](K, ((-)\circ i) (\mathbf{U}))
     & \simeq
     C_{th}(i(K), \mathbf{U})
     \\
     & \simeq
      C(K, p(\mathbf{U}))
  \end{aligned}
$$

and using that $p$ preserves covers by assumption.

Therefore $(-) \circ i$ is a left and right local [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen functor]] with left local Quillen adjoint $Lan_i$ and right local Quillen adjoint $(-)\circ p$.

It follows that $i^* : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th}) \to Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is given by the left [[derived functor]] of restriction along $i$, and 
$i_* : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ is given by the right [[derived functor]] of restriction along $p$. 

Finally to see that also $Ran_p$ preserves locally fibrant objects by the same reasoning as above, notice that for every [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ and every morphism $\mathbf{K} \to p^* U$ in $C_{th}$ we may find a covering $\{\mathbf{K}_j  \to \mathbf{K}\}$ of $\mathbf{K}$ such that we find commuting diagrams on the left of

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{K}_j &\to& p^* U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{K} &\to& p^* U
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    p(\mathbf{K}_j) & =&  i^*(\mathbf{K}_j) &\to&  U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    p(\mathbf{K}) &= & i^*(\mathbf{K})  &\to&  U
  }
  \,,
$$

because by adjunction these correspond to commuting diagrams as indicated on the right, which exist by definition of [[coverage]] on $C$ and lift through $p$ by assumption on $C_{th}$.

This implies that $\{p^* U_i \to p^* U\}$ is a _generalized cover_ in the terminology at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], which by the discussion there implies that the corresponding [[Cech nerve]] equivalent to the [[sieve]] inclusion is a weak equivalence.

This establishes the quadruple of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s as claimed.

It remains to see that $i_!$ is full and faithful.

For that notice the general fact that left 
[[Kan extension]] (see the propeties discussed there) along a [[full and faithful functor]] $i$ satisfies $Lan_i \circ i \simeq id$. It remains to observe that since $(-)\circ i$ is not only right but also left Quillen by the above, we have that $i^* Lan_i$ applied to a cofibrant object is already the [[derived functor]] of the composite.

Conversely this implies that $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ is an [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] over [[Smooth∞Grpd]], exhibited by the triple of adjunctions

$$
  (i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!) :

### Structures in the presence of infinitesimal cohesion

We discuss structures that are canonically present in 
a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos equipped with infinitesimal cohesion. These structures parallel the [structures in a general cohesive (∞,1)-topos](#Structures).




#### Infinitesimal paths and de Rham spaces
  {#InfinitesimalPaths}
 
In the presence of [infinitesimal cohesion](#InfinitesimalCohesiveInfTopos) there is an infinitesimal analog of the [geometric paths ∞-groupoids](#Paths).

##### Infinitesimal path $\infty$-groupoid

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction}
###### Definition

Define the [[adjoint triple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s corresponding to the [[adjoint quadruple]] $(i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)$:

$$
 (\mathbf{Red} \dashv \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \dashv \mathbf{\flat}_{dR})
 : 
 (i_! i^* \dashv i_* i^* \dashv i_* i^! ) 
  :
 \mathbf{H}_{th} 
  \to 
 \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \,.
$$

For $X\in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ we say that

* $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is the **infinitesimal path $\infty$-groupoid** 
  of $X$;

  The $(i^* \dashv i_*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] 

  $$
    X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  $$

  we call the **constant infinitesimal path inclusion**.

* $\mathbf{Red}(X)$ is the **reduced cohesive $\infty$-groupoid** underlying
  $X$.

  The $(i_* \dashv i^*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] 

  $$
    \mathbf{Red} X \to X
  $$

  we call the **inclusion of the reduced part** of $X$.

=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark #TerminologyDeRhamspace}
###### Remark

In traditional contexts see ([SimpsonTeleman, p. 7](#SimpsonTeleman)) the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is called the **[[de Rham space]] of $X$** or the **de Rham stack of $X$** .
Here we may tend to avoid this terminology, since by the discussion at <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#deRhamCohomology">cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- de Rham cohomology</a> we have a good notion of intrinsic [[de Rham cohomology]] in any [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] already without equipping it with infinitesimal cohesion. From this point of view the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is not primarily characterized by the fact that (in some models, see [below](#Examples)) it does co-represent de Rham cohomology -- because the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{dR}(X)$ from [above](#deRhamCohomology) does, too -- but by the fact that it does so in an explicitly ([[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]]) infinitesimal way.

##### Jet $\infty$-bundles
 {#JetBundleObjects}

Notice that for $f : X \to Y$ any [[morphism]] in any [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, there is the corresponding [[base change geometric morphism]] between the [[over-(∞,1)-toposes]]

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) : \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}} \mathbf{H}/Y
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For any object $X \in \mathbf{H}$ write

$$
  Jet : \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}
  \mathbf{H}/\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
$$

for the [[base change geometric morphism]] induced by the constant infinitesimal path inclusion $i : X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, def. \ref{InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction}.

For $(E \to X) \in \mathbf{H}/X$ we call $Jet(E) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ as well as its pullback $i^* Jet(E) \to X$ (depending on context) the **[[jet bundle]]** of $E \to X$.

##### Formally smooth/étale/unramified morphisms

+-- {: .num_defn #FormalSmoothness}
###### Definition

We say an object $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is **formally smooth** if the constant infinitesimal path inclusion, $X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, def. \ref{InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction},
is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]].

In this form this is the evident $(\infty,1)$-categorical analog of the conditions as they appear for instance in ([SimpsonTeleman, page 7](#SimpsonTeleman)).

###### Note

An object $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is formally smooth according to def. \ref{FormalSmoothness} precisely if the canonical morphism

$$
  i_! X \to i_* X
$$

(induced from the [[adjoint quadruple]] $(i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)$, see there) is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]].

The canonical morphism is the composite

In this form this characterization of formal smoothness is the evident generalization of the condition given in ([Kontsevich-Rosenberg, section 4.1](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

Therefore we have the following more general definition.

+-- {: .num_defn #FormalRelativeSmoothnessByCanonicalMorphism}
###### Definition

For $f : X \to Y$ a morphism in $\mathbf{H}$, we say that 

1. $f$ is a **[[formally smooth morphism]]** if the canonical morphism

   $$
     i_! X 
      \to 
     i_! Y \prod_{i_* Y} i_* Y
   $$

   is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]].

1. $f$ is a **[[formally unramified morphism]]** if this is a [[(-1)-truncated]] morphism. More generally,  $f$ is an _order-$k$ formally unramified morphisms_ for $(-2) \leq k \leq \infty$ if this is a [[k-truncated]] morphism.

1. $f$ is a **[[formally étale morphism]]** if this morphism is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]], hence if

   $$
     \array{
        i_! X &\stackrel{i_! f}{\to}& i_! Y

        \downarrow && \downarrow
        \\
        i_* X &\stackrel{i_* f}{\to}& i_* Y

   is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square.

An order-(-2) formally unramified morphism is equivalently a [[formally étale morphism]].

Only for [[0-truncated]] $X$ does formal smoothness together with formal unramifiedness imply formal étaleness.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #PropertiesOfFormallyEtaleMorphisms}
###### Proposition

The collection of [[formally étale morphism]]s in $\mathbf{H}$, def. \ref{FormalRelativeSmoothnessByCanonicalMorphism}, is closed under the following operations.

1. Every [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] is formally étale.

1. The composite of two formally étale morphisms is itself formally étale.

1. If

   $$
     \array{
       && Y
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& Z
     }
   $$

   is a [[diagram]] such that $g$ and $h$ are formally étale, then also $f$ is formally étale.

1. Any [[retract]] of a formally étale morphisms is itself formally étale.

1. The [[(∞,1)-pullback]] of a formally étale morphisms is formally étale if the pullback is preserved by $i_!$.

=--

The statements about closure under composition and pullback appears as([KontsevichRosenberg, prop. 5.4, prop. 5.6](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)). Notice that the extra assumption that $i_!$ preserves the pullback is implicit in their setup, by remark \ref{RelationToRK}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows since $\infty$-pullbacks are well defined up to quivalence.

The second two statements follow by the [[pasting law]] for [[(∞,1)-pullback]]s: let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be two 
morphisms and consider the [[pasting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    i_! X &\stackrel{i_! f }{\to}& i_! Y &\stackrel{i_! g}{\to}&  Z
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    i_* X &\stackrel{i_* f }{\to}& i_* Y &\stackrel{i_* g}{\to}& i_* Z    
  }
  \,.
$$

If $f$ and $g$ are formally étale then both small squares are pullback squares. Then the pasting law says that so is the outer rectangle and hence $g \circ f$ is formally étale. Similarly, if $g$ and $g \circ f$ are formally étale then the right square and the total reactangle are pullbacks, so the pasting law says that also the left square is a pullback and so also $f$ is formally étale.

For the fourth claim, let $Id \simeq (g \to f \to g)$ be a [[retract]] in the [[arrow category|arrow (∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}^I$. By applying the natural transformation $\phi : i_! \to I_*$ we obtain a retract 

$$
  Id \simeq ((i_! g \to i_*g) \to  (i_! f \to i_*f) \to (i_! g \to i_*g))
$$

in the category of squares $\mathbf{H}^{\Box}$. We claim that generally, if the middle piece in a retract in $\mathbf{H}^\Box$ is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square, then so is its retract sqare. This implies the fourth claim.

To see this, we use that 

1. [[(∞,1)-limit]]s are computed by [[homotopy limit]]s in any [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] $C$ presenting $\mathbf{H}$;

1. homotopy limits in $C$ may be computed by the left and right adjoints provided by the [[derivator]] $Ho(C)$ associated to $C$.

From this the claim follows as described in detail at _[[retract]]_ in the section _<a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/retract#RetractsOfDiagrams">retracts of diagrams</a>_ .

For the last claim, consider an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    A \times_Y X &\to& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    A &\to& Y
  }
$$

where $f$ is formally étale.

Applying the [[natural transformation]] $\phi : i_! \to i_*$ to this yields a square of squares. Two sides of this are the [[pasting]] composite


$$
  \array{
    i_! A \times_Y X &\to& i_! X &\stackrel{\phi_X}{\to}&  i_* X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! f}} 
                        && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* f}}
    \\
    i_! A &\to& i_! Y &\stackrel{\phi_Y}{\to}& i_* Y
  }
$$

and the other two sides are the pasting composite

$$
  \array{
     i_! A \times_Y X &\stackrel{\phi_{A \times_Y X}}{\to}& i_* A \times_Y A
     &\stackrel{}{\to}& i_* X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* f}}
     \\
     i_! A &\stackrel{\phi_A}{\to}& i_* A &\to& i_* Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Counting left to right and top to bottom, we have that

* the first square is a pullback by assumption that $i_!$ preserves the given pullback;

* the second square is a pullback, since $f$ is formally étale.

* the total top rectangle is therefore a pullback, by the [[pasting law]];

* the fourth square is a pullback since $i_*$ is [[right adjoint]] and so also preserves pullbacks;

* also the total bottom rectangle is a pullback, since it is equal to the top  total rectangle;

* therefore finally the third square is a pullback, by the other clause of the [[pasting law]]. Hence  $p$ is formally étale.

The properties listed in prop. \ref{PropertiesOfFormallyEtaleMorphisms} correspond to the axioms on the _[[open map]]s_ ("admissible maps") in a [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]]  ([Lurie, def. 1.2.1](#LurieStSp)). This means that a notion of formally étale morphisms induces a notion of [[locally algebra-ed topos|locally algebra-ed (∞,1)toposes]]/[[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es in a cohesive context.

In this case we shall write

$$

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) \to \mathbf{\Pi}(X)

An [[∞-group]] object $\mathfrak{g} \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ that is infinitesimal we call an **[[formal ∞-group]]** . 

For $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any object, we say 
$\mathfrak{a} \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is a
**[[formal cohesive ∞-groupoid]] over $X$** if $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(\mathfrak{a}) \simeq \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$; equivalently: if there is a morphism

###### Proposition

An infinitesimal cohesive $\infty$-groupoid
is both geometrically contractible and has as underlying discrete $\infty$-groupoid the point:

* $\Pi X \simeq *$

* $\Gamma X \simeq {*}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is implied by the fact that 
both $i_!$ as well as $i_*$ are full and faithful. This means that
if $\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{inf}}(X) \simeq *$ then already $i^* X = \Pi_{\mathrm{inf}}(X) \simeq *$.
Since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}} \simeq \Pi_{\mathbf{H}} \Pi_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and 
$\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}$ preserves the terminal object by cohesiveness, this implies the first claim.
 
The second statement follows by 
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma X & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(*,X)
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(\mathbf{Red}*, X)

For all $X \in \mathbf{H}$, we have that $X$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ are [formal cohesive ∞-groupoids](#InfinitesimalObject) over $X$, the first by the constant infinitesmal path inclusion, the second by the identity.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $X$ this is tautological, for $\mathbf{\Pi}(X)$ it follows from the [idempotency of Red](#RedIsIdempotent) and the $(i^* \dashv i_*)$-[[zig-zag identity]].

###### Proof

Since both $i^*$ and $i_*$ are [[right adjoint]], the [infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid functor](#InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction) commutes with [[delooping]]. Therefore 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \mathbf{B}\mathfrak{g}

An [infinitesimal cohesive ∞-groupoid](#InfinitesimalObject) 
$X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is both [geometrically contractible](#ExponentiatedLieAsGeometricallyContractible) and has as underlying [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] the point:

* $\Pi X \simeq *$

* $\Gamma X \simeq *$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows with using the [above observation](#InfinitesimalInclusionIfFullAndFaithful) from the full and faithfulness of $i_!$ and $i_*$.

The former implies that with $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) \simeq *$ already $i^*X  = \Pi_{inf}X = *$. Since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \simeq \Pi_{\mathbf{H}} \Pi_{inf}$ and since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}$ preserves the point by cohesiveness, this implies the first claim.

For the latter we compute

The image of $i$ is contained in that of $\Omega^\infty$. Therefore we may restrict the $(cod \dashv i)$-adjunction on the right to the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] $\tilde T_C$ of $C^{\Delta[1]}$ on thise objects in the image of $\Omega^\infty$.
