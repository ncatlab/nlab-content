## Idea

A [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is a context of [[∞-groupoid]]s that are equipped with a [[geometry|geometric]] notion of _cohesion_ on their collections of [[object]]s and [[k-morphism]]s, for instance [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoid|topological cohesion]] or [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth cohesion]].

While the axioms of cohesion do imply the intrinsic existence of _exponentiated_ [[infinitesimal space]]s, they do not admit access to an explicit [[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]] notion of infinitesimal extension. 

Here we consider one extra axiom on a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] that does imply a good intrinsic notion of synthetic differential extension, compatible with the given notion of cohesion. We speak of _infinitesimal cohesion_ .

In a cohesion $(\infty,1)$-topos with infinitesimal cohesion there are for instance good intrinsic notions of [[formally smooth morphism|formal smoothness]] and of [[de Rham space]]s of objects.

## Differential cohesion

We discuss [[extra structure]] on a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]
that encodes a refinement of the corresponding notion of cohesion to 
_[[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] cohesion_ . More precisely, we consider inclusions
$\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ of cohesive 
$(\infty,1)$-toposes that exhibit the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
as infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhoods of objects in 
$\mathbf{H}$.

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalCohesiveInfTopos}
###### Definition

Given a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ we say that 
an **infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood** of $\mathbf{H}$
is another cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
equipped with an  [[adjoint quadruple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] of the form

$$
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
$$

where $i_!$ is  a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|full and faithful]] and [[left exact (∞,1)-functor]]

> This used to demand instead of left exactness just preservation of finite products, and this is still what is considered in some related entries...

Equivalently this means that $(i_! \dashv i^\ast) \colon \mathbf{H}_{th} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ is a [[local geometric morphism]] with a further [[right adjoint]] to the right adjoint to the [[direct image]].

###### Remark

This definition is an abstraction of similar situations considered in ([SimpsonTeleman](#SimpsonTeleman)) and in [Kontsevich-Rosenberg](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces). See also the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Q-category#InfinitesimalThickening">Infinitesimal thickenings</a> at [[Q-category]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #InfinitesimalInclusionIfFullAndFaithful}
###### Remark

This implies that also $i_*$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the characterizaton of full and faithful [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s 
the condition on $i_!$ is equivalent to $i^* i_! \simeq Id$. Since $(i^* i_! \dashv i^* i_*)$ it follows by essential uniqueness of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s that also $i^* i_* \simeq Id$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This definition captures the characterization of an [[infinitesimal object]] as having a single [[global element|global point]] surrounded by an infinitesimal neighbourhood: as we shall see in more detail [below](#InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction), the [[(∞,1)-functor]] $i^*$ may be thought of as contracting away any infinitesimal extension of an object. Thus $X$ being an [infinitesimal object](#InfinitesimalObject) amounts to  $i^* X \simeq *$, and the [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor|(∞,1)-adjunction]] $(i_! \dashv i^*)$ then indeed guarantees that $X$ has only a single global point, since 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, X) 
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(i_! *, X) 
      \\
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, i^* X)
      \\
      & \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, *)
      \\
      & \simeq *
 \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodIsOverInfGroupoid}
###### Proposition

The inclusion into the infinitesimal neighbourhood is necessarily
a morphism of [[(∞,1)-topos]]es over [[∞Grpd]].

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{H} && \stackrel{(i^* \dashv i_*)}{\to} && \mathbf{H}_{th}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Gamma}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\Gamma}}
     \\
     && \infty Grpd 
  }
$$

as is the induced geometric morphism
$(i_* \dashv i^!) : \mathbf{H}_{th} \to \mathbf{H}$

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{H}_{th} && \stackrel{(i_* \dashv i^!)}{\to} 
      && \mathbf{H}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Gamma}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\Gamma}}
     \\
     && \infty Grpd 
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover $i_*$ is necessarily a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By essential uniqueness of th [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]]:
In both cases the [[direct image]] functor has as [[left adjoint]]
that preserves the [[terminal object]]. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}_{th}}( i_* X )
    & 
    \simeq
    \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, i_* X)
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}(i^* *, X)
    \\
    & 
    \simeq \mathbf{H}(*, X)
    \\
    & \simeq \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}(X)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Analogously in the second case.

=--


We shall write 

$$
  (\Pi_{inf} \dashv Disc_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  := 
  (i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
$$

so that the [[global section]] geometric moprhism of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ factors as

$$
  (\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \dashv Disc_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \dashv \Gamma_{\mathbf{H}_{th}})
  :
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{inf}}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{\mathbf{H}}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$


Let for the remainder of this section an infinitesimal neighbourhood $\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ be fixed.

#### From $\infty$-sheaves over infinitesimal neighbourhood sites
 {#PresentationOnInfinitesimalNeighbourhoodSites}

We give a presentation of classes of infinitesimal neighbourhoods by [[simplicial presheaves]] on suitable [[site]]s.

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalNeighBourhoodSite}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be an [[∞-cohesive site]]. We say a [[site]] $C_{th}$ 

* equipped with a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective embedding]]

  $$
    (i \dashv p) : 
     C \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{p}{\leftarrow}}
    C_{th}
  $$

* such that 

  * $i$ preserves [[pullback]]s along morphisms in [[covering]] families;

  * both $i$ and $p$ send [[covering]] families to covering families;

  * for all $\mathbf{U}$ in $C_{th}$ and covering families $\{U_i \to p(\mathbf{U})\}$ there is a lift through $p$ to a covering family $\{\mathbf{U}_i \to \mathbf{U}\}$

is an **infinitesimal neighbourhood site** of $C$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodFromInfinitesimalSite}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an [[∞-cohesive site]] and  $(i \dashv p) : C \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{p}{\leftarrow}} C_{th}$ an [infinitesimal neighbourhood site](#InfinitesimalNeighBourhoodSite). 

Then the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $C_{th}$ is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos and the restriction $i^*$ along $i$ exhibits it as an [infinitesimal neighbourhood](#InfinitesimalNeighbourhoodIsOverInfGroupoid) of the cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos over $C$.

$$
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}

  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{th})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, $i_!$ restricts on representables to the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] factoring through $i$:

$$
  \array{
    C &\hookrightarrow& Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    C_{th} &\hookrightarrow& Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})
  }
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-category]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ by the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localized]] at the [[covering]] [[sieve]] inclusions 

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th}) \simeq
  ([C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{loc})^\circ
$$

(as discussed at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes|models for (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes]]).


Consider the right [[Kan extension]] $Ran_i : [C^{op}, sSet] \to [C_{th}^{op},sSet]$ of [[simplicial presheaves]] along the functor $i$. On an object $K \times D \in C_{th}$ it is given by the [[end]]-expression

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{Ran}_{i} F : \mathbf{K} 
    & \mapsto 
    \int_{U \in C} \mathrm{sSet}( C_{\mathrm{th}}(i(U), \mathbf{K})  , F(U))
    \\
    & \simeq 
    \int_{U \in C} \mathrm{sSet}( C(U, p(\mathbf{K}))  , F(U))
    \\
    & \simeq 
    F(p(\mathbf{K}))
    \\
    & =: (p^* F)(\mathbf{K})
   \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the last step we use the [[Yoneda reduction]]-form of the [[Yoneda lemma]]. 

This shows that the [[right adjoint]] to $(-)\circ i$ is itself given by precomposition with a functor, and hence has itself a further right adjoint, which gives us a total of four [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  [C^{op}, sSet]  
    \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]
  \,.
$$

From this are directly induced the corresponding [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]]s on the global projective and injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  (Lan_i \dashv (-) \circ i) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\underset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-)\circ i \dashv (-) \circ p) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
    {\underset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-) \circ p \dashv Ran_p) : 
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
  \,.
$$

Observe that $Lan_i$, being a left [[Kan extension]], sends representables to representables: we have

$$
  Lan_i C(-,T) :
  \mathbf{K}
  \mapsto
  \int^{U \in C} C_{th}(\mathbf{K}, i(U))
   \cdot C(U,T)
$$

and by [[Yoneda reduction]] (more explicitly: observing that this is equivalently the formula for left [[Kan extension]] of the non-corepresentable $C_{th}(K \times D, i(-)) : C \to sSet$ along the identity functor) this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq C_{th}(\mathbf{K}, i(T))
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] for the above Quillen adjunctions to descend to the Cech-local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] it suffices that the [[right adjoint]]s preserve locally fibrant objects. 

We first check that $(-) \circ i$ sends locally fibrant objects to locally fibrant objects.  

To that end, let $\{U_i \to U\}$ be a [[covering family]] in $C$. Write $\int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} (j(U_{i_0}) \times_{j(U)} j(U_{i_1}) \times_{j(U)} \cdots \times_{j(U)} j(U_k))$ for its [[Cech nerve]], where $j$ denotes the [[Yoneda embedding]]. Recall by the definition of the [[∞-cohesive site]] $C$ that all the [[fiber product]]s of representable presheaves here are again themselves representable, hence $\cdots = \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} (j(U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k))$. This means that the [[left adjoint]] $Lan_i$ preserves not only the [[coend]] and [[tensoring]], but by the remark in the previous paragraph and the assumption that $i$ preserves [[pullback]]s along covers we have that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Lan_i 
    C(\{U_i \to U\})
    & \simeq 
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} Lan_i (j(U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k))    
     \\
     & \simeq
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} 
  j i (U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1} \times_U \cdots \times_U U_k)    
    \\
    & \simeq
     \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot \coprod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} 
  j (i(U_{i_0}) \times_{i(U)} i(U_{i_1}) \times_{i(U)} \cdots \times_{i(U)} i(U_k))      
  \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$ 

By the assumption that $i$ preserves covers, this is the [[Cech nerve]] of a [[covering family]] in $C_{th}$. Therefore for $F \in [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$ fibrant we have for all [[covering]]s $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ that the [[descent]] morphism

$$
  (i^* F)(U) = F(i(U))
   \stackrel{}{\to}
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet](C(\{i(U_i)\}), F)
  =
  [C^{op}, sSet](C(\{U_i\}), i^* F)
$$

is a weak equivalence, hence that $i^* F$ is locally fibrant.

To see that $(-) \circ p$ preserves locally fibrant objects, we apply the analogous reasoning after observing that its [[left adjoint]] $(-)\circ i$ preserves all [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s of [[simplicial presheaves]] (as these are computed objectwise) and by observing that for 
$\{\mathbf{U}_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} \mathbf{U}\}$ 
a covering family in $C_{th}$ we have that its image under $(-) \circ i$ is its image under $p$, by the [[Yoneda lemma]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     [C^{op}, sSet](K, ((-)\circ i) (\mathbf{U}))
     & \simeq
     C_{th}(i(K), \mathbf{U})
     \\
     & \simeq
      C(K, p(\mathbf{U}))
  \end{aligned}
$$

and using that $p$ preserves covers by assumption.

Therefore $(-) \circ i$ is a left and right local [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen functor]] with left local Quillen adjoint $Lan_i$ and right local Quillen adjoint $(-)\circ p$.

It follows that $i^* : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th}) \to Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is given by the left [[derived functor]] of restriction along $i$, and 
$i_* : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ is given by the right [[derived functor]] of restriction along $p$. 

Finally to see that also $Ran_p$ preserves locally fibrant objects by the same reasoning as above, notice that for every [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ and every morphism $\mathbf{K} \to p^* U$ in $C_{th}$ we may find a covering $\{\mathbf{K}_j  \to \mathbf{K}\}$ of $\mathbf{K}$ such that we find commuting diagrams on the left of

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{K}_j &\to& p^* U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{K} &\to& p^* U
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    p(\mathbf{K}_j) & =&  i^*(\mathbf{K}_j) &\to&  U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    p(\mathbf{K}) &= & i^*(\mathbf{K})  &\to&  U
  }
  \,,
$$

because by adjunction these correspond to commuting diagrams as indicated on the right, which exist by definition of [[coverage]] on $C$ and lift through $p$ by assumption on $C_{th}$.

This implies that $\{p^* U_i \to p^* U\}$ is a _generalized cover_ in the terminology at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], which by the discussion there implies that the corresponding [[Cech nerve]] equivalent to the [[sieve]] inclusion is a weak equivalence.

This establishes the quadruple of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s as claimed.

It remains to see that $i_!$ is full and faithful.
For that notice the general fact that left 
[[Kan extension]] (see the properties discussed there) along a [[full and faithful functor]] $i$ satisfies $Lan_i \circ i \simeq id$. It remains to observe that since $(-)\circ i$ is not only right but also left Quillen by the above, we have that $i^* Lan_i$ applied to a cofibrant object is already the [[derived functor]] of the composite.

### Structures in a differential cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
 {#StructuresInDifferentialCohesion}

We discuss structures that are canonically present in 
a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos equipped with infinitesimal cohesion. These structures parallel the [structures in a general cohesive (∞,1)-topos](#Structures).




#### Infinitesimal paths and de Rham spaces
  {#InfinitesimalPaths}
 
In the presence of [infinitesimal cohesion](#InfinitesimalCohesiveInfTopos) there is an infinitesimal analog of the [geometric paths ∞-groupoids](#Paths).

##### Infinitesimal path $\infty$-groupoid

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction}
###### Definition

Define the [[adjoint triple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s corresponding to the [[adjoint quadruple]] $(i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)$:

$$
 (\mathbf{Red} \dashv \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \dashv \mathbf{\flat}_{dR})
 : 
 (i_! i^* \dashv i_* i^* \dashv i_* i^! ) 
  :
 \mathbf{H}_{th} 
  \to 
 \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \,.
$$

We say that

* $Red$ is the **[[reduction modality]]**.

* $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$ or $&#643;_{inf}$ is the **[[infinitesimal shape modality]]**.

* $\flat_{inf}$ is the **[[infinitesimal flat modality]]**.

An object in the full sub-$\infty$-category

* of $Red$ we call a **[[reduced object]]**

* of $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$ we call a **[[coreduced object]]**.

For $X\in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ we say that

* $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is the **[[infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid]]** 
  of $X$;

  The $(i^* \dashv i_*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] 

  $$
    X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  $$

  we call the **constant infinitesimal path inclusion**.

* $\mathbf{Red}(X)$ is the **[[reduced cohesive ∞-groupoid]]** underlying
  $X$.

  The $(i_* \dashv i^*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] 

  $$
    \mathbf{Red} X \to X
  $$


  we call the **inclusion of the reduced part** of $X$.

+-- {: .num_remark #TerminologyDeRhamspace}
###### Remark

In traditional contexts see ([SimpsonTeleman, p. 7](#SimpsonTeleman)) the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is called the **[[de Rham space]] of $X$** or the **de Rham stack of $X$** .
Here we may tend to avoid this terminology, since by the discussion at <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#deRhamCohomology">cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- de Rham cohomology</a> we have a good notion of intrinsic [[de Rham cohomology]] in any [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] already without equipping it with infinitesimal cohesion. From this point of view the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is not primarily characterized by the fact that (in some models, see [below](#Examples)) it does co-represent de Rham cohomology -- because the object $\mathbf{\Pi}_{dR}(X)$ from [above](#deRhamCohomology) does, too -- but by the fact that it does so in an explicitly ([[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]]) infinitesimal way.

##### Jet $\infty$-bundles
 {#JetBundleObjects}

Notice that for $f : X \to Y$ any [[morphism]] in any [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, there is the corresponding [[base change geometric morphism]] between the [[over-(∞,1)-toposes]]

for the [[base change geometric morphism]] induced by the constant infinitesimal path inclusion $i : X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, def. \ref{InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction}.

For $(E \to X) \in \mathbf{H}/X$ we call $Jet(E) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ as well as its pullback $i^* Jet(E) \to X$ (depending on context) the **[[jet bundle]]** of $E \to X$.

###### Definition

We say an object $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is **formally smooth** if the constant infinitesimal path inclusion, $X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, def. \ref{InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction},

An object $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is formally smooth according to def. \ref{FormalSmoothness} precisely if the canonical morphism

$$
  i_! X \to i_* X
$$

(induced from the [[adjoint quadruple]] $(i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)$, see there) is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}

###### Proof


The canonical morphism is the composite

$$
  (i_! \to i_*)

   \stackrel{\eta i_!}{\to}
  \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} i_! := i_* i^* i_!

$$

By the condition that $i_!$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] the second morphism here in an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]], as indicated, and hence the component of the composite on $X$ being an effective epimorphism is equivalent to the component $i_! X \to \mathbf{\Pi} i_! X$ being an effective epimorphism.

###### Definition

For $f : X \to Y$ a morphism in $\mathbf{H}$, we say that 

1. $f$ is a **[[formally smooth morphism]]** if the canonical morphism

     i_! X

1. $f$ is a **[[formally unramified morphism]]** if this is a [[(-1)-truncated]] morphism. More generally,  $f$ is an _order-$k$ formally unramified morphisms_ for $(-2) \leq k \leq \infty$ if this is a [[k-truncated]] morphism.

1. $f$ is a **[[formally étale morphism]]** if this morphism is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]], hence if

+-- {: .num_prop #PropertiesOfFormallyEtaleMorphisms}
###### Proposition

The collection of [[formally étale morphisms]] in $\mathbf{H}$, def. \ref{FormalRelativeSmoothnessByCanonicalMorphism}, is closed under the following operations.

1. Every [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] is formally étale.

1. The composite of two formally étale morphisms is itself formally étale.

1. If


   $$
     \array{
       && Y
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& Z
     }
   $$

   is a [[diagram]] such that $g$ and $h$ are formally étale, then also $f$ is formally étale.

1. Any [[retract]] of a formally étale morphisms is itself formally étale.

1. The [[(∞,1)-pullback]] of a formally étale morphisms is formally étale if the pullback is preserved by $i_!$.

=--

The statements about closure under composition and pullback appears as([KontsevichRosenberg, prop. 5.4, prop. 5.6](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)). Notice that the extra assumption that $i_!$ preserves the pullback is implicit in their setup, by remark \ref{RelationToRK}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows since $\infty$-pullbacks are well defined up to quivalence.

The second two statements follow by the [[pasting law]] for [[(∞,1)-pullback]]s: let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be two 
morphisms and consider the [[pasting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    i_! X &\stackrel{i_! f }{\to}& i_! Y &\stackrel{i_! g}{\to}&  Z
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    i_* X &\stackrel{i_* f }{\to}& i_* Y &\stackrel{i_* g}{\to}& i_* Z    
  }
  \,.
$$

If $f$ and $g$ are formally étale then both small squares are pullback squares. Then the pasting law says that so is the outer rectangle and hence $g \circ f$ is formally étale. Similarly, if $g$ and $g \circ f$ are formally étale then the right square and the total reactangle are pullbacks, so the pasting law says that also the left square is a pullback and so also $f$ is formally étale.

For the fourth claim, let $Id \simeq (g \to f \to g)$ be a [[retract]] in the [[arrow category|arrow (∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}^I$. By applying the natural transformation $\phi : i_! \to I_*$ we obtain a retract 

$$
  Id \simeq ((i_! g \to i_*g) \to  (i_! f \to i_*f) \to (i_! g \to i_*g))
$$

in the category of squares $\mathbf{H}^{\Box}$. We claim that generally, if the middle piece in a retract in $\mathbf{H}^\Box$ is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square, then so is its retract sqare. This implies the fourth claim.

To see this, we use that 

1. [[(∞,1)-limit]]s are computed by [[homotopy limit]]s in any [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] $C$ presenting $\mathbf{H}$;

1. homotopy limits in $C$ may be computed by the left and right adjoints provided by the [[derivator]] $Ho(C)$ associated to $C$.

From this the claim follows as described in detail at _[[retract]]_ in the section _<a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/retract#RetractsOfDiagrams">retracts of diagrams</a>_ .

For the last claim, consider an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    A \times_Y X &\to& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    A &\to& Y
  }
$$

where $f$ is formally étale.

Applying the [[natural transformation]] $\phi : i_! \to i_*$ to this yields a square of squares. Two sides of this are the [[pasting]] composite


$$
  \array{
    i_! A \times_Y X &\to& i_! X &\stackrel{\phi_X}{\to}&  i_* X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! f}} 
                        && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* f}}
    \\
    i_! A &\to& i_! Y &\stackrel{\phi_Y}{\to}& i_* Y
  }
$$

and the other two sides are the pasting composite

$$
  \array{
     i_! A \times_Y X &\stackrel{\phi_{A \times_Y X}}{\to}& i_* A \times_Y A
     &\stackrel{}{\to}& i_* X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_! p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_* f}}
     \\
     i_! A &\stackrel{\phi_A}{\to}& i_* A &\to& i_* Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Counting left to right and top to bottom, we have that

* the first square is a pullback by assumption that $i_!$ preserves the given pullback;

* the second square is a pullback, since $f$ is formally étale.

* the total top rectangle is therefore a pullback, by the [[pasting law]];

* the fourth square is a pullback since $i_*$ is [[right adjoint]] and so also preserves pullbacks;

* also the total bottom rectangle is a pullback, since it is equal to the top  total rectangle;

* therefore finally the third square is a pullback, by the other clause of the [[pasting law]]. Hence  $p$ is formally étale.

#### Structure sheaves
 {#StructureSheaves}
 {#CotangentBundles}

We discuss how in differential cohesion $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ every object $X$ canonically induces its [[étale (∞,1)-topos]] $Sh_{\mathbf{H}_{th}}(X)$.


For $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ any object in a differential cohesive $\infty$-topos, we formulate 

1. the [[(∞,1)-topos]] denoted $\mathcal{X}$ or $Sh_\infty(X)$ of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] over $X$, or rather of formally étale maps into $X$;

1. the [[structure (∞,1)-sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ of $X$.

The resulting structure is essentially that discussed ([Lurie, Structured Spaces](#Lurie)) if we regard $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ equipped with its formally étale morphisms, def. \ref{FormallyEtaleInHTh}, as a ([[large category|large]]) [[geometry for structured (∞,1)-toposes]]. 

One way to motivate this is to consider structure sheaves of flat differential forms. To that end, let $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}_{th})$ a differential cohesive [[∞-group]] with [de Rham coefficient object](cohesive+%28infinity,1%29-topos+--+structures#deRhamCohomology) $\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G$ and for $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ any differential homotopy type, the product projection 

$$
  X \times \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G \to X
$$

regarded as an object of the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ _almost_ qualifies as a "bundle of flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential forms" over $X$: for $U \to X$ an cover (a [[1-epimorphism]]) regarded in $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$, a $U$-plot of this product projection is a $U$-plot of $X$ together with a flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued de Rham cocycle on $X$.

This is indeed what the sections of a corresponding bundle of differential forms over $X$ are supposed to look like -- but only _if_ $U \to X$ is sufficiently _spread out_ over $X$, hence sufficiently [[étale map|étale]]. Because, on the extreme, if $X$ is the point (the [[terminal object]]), then there should be no non-trivial section of differential forms relative to $U$ over $X$, but the above product projection instead reproduces all the sections of $\flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G$.

In order to obtain the correct cotangent-like bundle from the product with the de Rham coefficient object, it needs to be _restricted_ to plots out of suficiently étale maps into $X$. In order to correctly test differential form data, "suitable" here should be "formally", namely infinitesimally. Hence the restriction should be along the full inclusion

$$
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet} \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}
$$

of the formally étale maps of def. \ref{FormallyEtaleInHTh} into $X$. Since on formally étale covers the sections should be those given by $\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G$, one finds that the corresponding "cotangent bundle" must be the [[coreflective subcategory|coreflection]] along this inclusion. The following proposition establishes that this coreflection indeed exists.


 
+-- {: .num_defn #EtaleSlice}
###### Definition

For $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ any object, write

$$
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})^{fet}_{/X} \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}
$$ 

for the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] over $X$ on those maps into $X$ which are formally &eacute;tale, def. \ref{FormallyEtaleInHTh}.

We also write $FEt_{\mathbf{X}}$ or $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$ for $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EtalificationIsCoreflection}
###### Proposition

The inclusion $\iota$ of def. \ref{EtaleSlice} is both [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective]] as well as [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]], hence it fits into an [[adjoint triple]] of the form

$$
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet} 
  \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{Et}{\leftarrow}}}
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the general discussion at _[[reflective factorization system]]_, the reflection is given by sending a morphism $f \colon Y \to X$ to 
$X \times_{\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)} \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Y) \to Y$ and the reflection [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] is the left horizontal morphism in 

$$
  \array{
    Y &\to& X \times_{\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Y)} \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Y) &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Y)
   \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow^{} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(f)}}
   \\
   && X &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  }
  \,.
$$ 

Therefore $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$, being a reflective subcategory of a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]], is (as discussed there) itself locally presentable. Hence by the [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem]] it is now sufficient to show that the inclusion preserves all small [[(∞,1)-colimits]] in order to conclude that it also has a right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]. 

So consider any [[diagram]] [[(∞,1)-functor]] $I \to (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$ out of a [[small (∞,1)-category]]. Since the inclusion of $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$ is full, it is sufficient to show that the $(\infty,1)$-colimit over this diagram taken in $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ lands again in $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$ in order to have that $(\infty,1)$-colimits are preserved by the inclusion. Moreover, colimits in a slice of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ are computed in $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ itself (this is discussed at _[slice category - Colimits](overcategory#LimitsAndColimits)_).

Therefore we are reduced to showing that the square

$$
  \array{
    \underset{\to_i}{\lim} Y_i &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \underset{\to_i}{\lim} Y_i 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  }
$$

is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square. But since $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$ is a [[left adjoint]] it commutes with the $(\infty,1)$-colimit on objects and hence this diagram is equivalent to 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{\to_i}{\lim} Y_i &\to& \underset{\to_i}{\lim} \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} Y_i 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram is now indeed an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] by the fact that we have [[universal colimits]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{th}$, hence that on the left the component $Y_i$ for each $i \in I$ is the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] of $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Y_i) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, by assumption that we are taking an $(\infty,1)$-colimit over formally &eacute;tale morphisms.

###### Proposition

The $\infty$-category $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$ is an [[(∞,1)-topos]] and the canonical inclusion into $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ is a [[geometric embedding]].

###### Proof

By prop. \ref{EtalificationIsCoreflection} the inclusion $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet} \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ is [[reflective sub-(infinity,1)-category|reflective]] with reflector given by the $(\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}-equivalences , \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}-closed)$ factorization system. Since $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$ is a [[right adjoint]] and hence in particular preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]], the $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$-equivalences are stable under pullbacks. By the discussion at _[[stable factorization system]]_ this is the case precisely if the corresponding reflector preserves [[finite (∞,1)-limits]]. Hence the embedding is a [[geometric embedding]] which exhibits a [[sub-(∞,1)-topos]] inclusion.

indeed an $\mathbf{H}_{th}$-[[structure sheaf]] in the sense of [[structured (∞,1)-toposes]], for $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ regarded as a (large) [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] with the [[formally étale morphisms]] being the "admissible morphisms".

=--

This is the analog of ([[Structured Spaces|Lurie, Structured Spaces, prop. 2.2.11]]).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ preserves [[finite (∞,1)-limits]] and [[formally étale morphism|formally étale]] [[covers]] (where covers here in the [[canonical topology]] on the given toposes are [[1-epimorphisms]]). The first statement follows since $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ is [[right adjoint]] to the forgetful functor

$$
  Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X) 
    \simeq 
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet} 
    \hookrightarrow 
  (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X} 
    \stackrel{\underset{X}{\sum}}{\to}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
$$

For the second statement, let $p \colon \widehat Y \longrightarrow Y$ be any [[1-epimorphism]] which is also a [[formally étale morphism|formally étale]]. We need to show that also $Et(X \times p)$ is a [[1-epimorphism]].  By the discussion at [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] for this it is sufficient that the [[0-truncated|0-truncation]] $\tau_0 Et(X \times p)$ is an [[epimorphism]] in the underlying [[sheaf topos]], hence that every [[generalized element]] of $Et(X \times Y)$ has a lift to $Et(X \times \widehat{Y})$ after refinement along a cover.

By the fact that $Et$ is [[right adjoint]] to the inclusion, by construction, this means that it is sufficient to show that given a [[diagram]] in $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    && && X \times \widehat{Y}
    \\
    && && \downarrow
    \\
    U && \longrightarrow && X \times Y
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

with $U \to X$ formally étale, this can be completed to a diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    \widehat{U} && \longrightarrow && X \times \widehat{Y}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    U && \longrightarrow && X \times Y
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

with $\widehat{U} \to U$ a formally étale 1-epimorphism. But since both [[1-epimorphisms]] as well as [[formally étale morphisms]] are stable under [[(∞,1)-pullback]] we can take $\widehat U \coloneqq \widehat{Y} \times_Y U$.

###### Remark

In the case that $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ happens to have an [[(∞,1)-site]] of definition whose [[covers]] are ([[Grothendieck pretopology|generated]]) from [[formally étale morphisms]] (a small [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]]), then $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ is the [[classifying topos|classifying (∞,1)-topos]] for [[structure sheaves]] and $\mathcal{O}_X$ in prop. \ref{StructureSheafIsIndeedStructureSheaf} may be regarded as the [[inverse image]] of the classifying [[geometric morphism]]

  \mathbf{H}_{th}

+-- {: .num_example #CotangentBundle}
###### Example

Let $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}_{th})$ be an [[∞-group]] and write $\flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ for the corresponding de Rham coefficient object.
Then 

$$
  \mathcal{O}_X(\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G)
  \in 
  Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)
$$ 

we may call the **$G$-valued flat cotangent sheaf** of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

For $U \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ a test object (say an object in a [[(∞,1)-site]] of definition, under the [[Yoneda embedding]]) a formally étale morphism $U \to X$ is like an [[open map]]/open embedding. Regarded as an object in $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{fet}$ we may consider the sections over $U$ of the cotangent bundle as defined above, which in $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ are diagrams

$$
  \array{
    U &&\to&& \mathcal{O}_X(\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G)
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

By the fact that $Et(-)$ is [[right adjoint]], such diagrams are in bijection to diagrams

$$
  \array{
    U &&\to&& X \times \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

where we are now simply including on the left the formally étale map $(U \to X)$ along $(\mathbf{H}_{th})^{fet}_{/X} \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$.

In other words, the sections of the $G$-valued flat cotangent sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G)$ are just the sections of $X \times \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G \to X$ itself, only that the _domain_ of the section is constrained to be a formally &eacute; patch of $X$.

But then by the very nature of $\flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}G$ it follows that the flat sections of the $G$-valued cotangent bundle of $X$ are indeed nothing but the flat $G$-valued differential forms on $X$.

+-- {: .num_prop #StructuredPetitToposesAreLocallyContractible}
###### Proposition

For $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ an object in a differentially cohesive
$\infty$-topos, then its petit structured $\infty$-topos
$Sh_{\mathbf{H}_{th}}(X)$, according to def. \ref{TheStructureSheafOfX},
is [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|locally ∞-connected]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that the composite

$$
  \infty Grpd \stackrel{Disc}{\longrightarrow} \mathbf{H}_{th}
   \stackrel{(-) \times X}{\longrightarrow}
   (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}
  \stackrel{L}{\longrightarrow}
  Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)
$$

preserves [[(∞,1)-limits]], so that it has a further 
[[left adjoint]]. Here $L$ is the 
reflector from prop. \ref{EtalificationIsCoreflection}. 
Inspection shows that this composite sends an object $A \in \infty Grpd$ to 
$\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A)) \times X \to X$:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A)) \times X
     &\longrightarrow&
    \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A) \times X) & \simeq \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A)) \times \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

 
By the discussion at [slice (∞,1)-category -- Limits and colimits](slice+infinity-category#LimitsAndColimits) an [[(∞,1)-limit]] in the slice $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ is computed as an [[(∞,1)-limit]] in $\mathbf{H}$ of the [[diagram]] with the slice [[cocone]] adjoined. By [[right adjoint|right adjointness]] of the inclusion $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X) \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ the same is then true for $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X) \coloneqq (\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}^{et}$.

Now for $A \colon J \to \infty Grpd$ a [[diagram]], it is taken to the diagram $j \mapsto \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_j)) \times X \to X$ in $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$ and so its $\infty$-limit is computed in $\mathbf{H}$ over the diagram locally of the form

$$
  \array{
     X \times \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_{j}))
     &&\longrightarrow&&
     X \times \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_{j'}))
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
  \simeq
  \array{
     X \times \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_{j}))
     &&\longrightarrow&&
     X \times \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_{j'}))
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X \times \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $\infty$-limits commute with each other this limit is the product of

1.  $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_j \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_j))$ 

1. $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_{J \star \Delta^0} X$ (over the co-coned diagram constant on $X$).

For the first of these, since the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}$
is in particular a [[right adjoint]] (with [[left adjoint]] the 
[[reduction modality]]), and since $Disc$ is also [[right adjoint]] by [[cohesion]], we have a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_j \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(A_j))
  \simeq
   \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(Disc(\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_j(A_j)))
  \,.
$$

For the second, the $\infty$-limit over an $\infty$-category $J \star \Delta^0$ of a functor constant on $X$ is 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_{J \star \Delta^0} X
     & \simeq
     \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_{J \star \Delta^0} [\ast, X]
     \\
     & \simeq
     [\underset{\rightarrow}{\lim}_{J \star \Delta^0} \ast, X]
     \\
     & \simeq
     [{\vert {J \star \Delta^0}\vert}, X]
     \\
     & \simeq 
     [\ast, X] \simeq X
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where the last line follows since ${J \star \Delta^0}$
has a terminal object and hence contractible geometric realization.

In conclusion this shows that $\infty$-limits are preserved by $L \circ (-)\times X\circ Disc$.

For $X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ an object and $(Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X), \mathcal{O}_X)$ its $\mathbf{H}$-[[structured (infinity,1)-topos]], according to def. \ref{TheStructureSheafOfX} and remark \ref{StructureSheafRestrictedToH}, exhibited by the composite functor

For $X,A \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ and with $\mathcal{O}_X(A) \in Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$ as in def. \ref{TheStructureSheafOfX}, write

$$
  \theta_X(A)
  \;\colon\;
  \underset{X}{\sum}
  \iota \mathcal{O}_X(A)
  \to
  A
$$

for the [[morphism]] in $\mathbf{H}$ which is the $(\underset{X}{\sum} \dashv X^*)$-adjunct $\underset{X}{\sum}\iota Et(X^* A) \to A$ of the [[counit of a comonad|counit]] $\iota Et(X^* A) \to X^* A$ of the $(\iota \dashv Et)$-coreflection of def. \ref{TheStructureSheafOfX}.

This $\theta_X(A)$ we call the **Liouville-Poincaré $A$-cocycle** on $\underset{X}{\sum} \iota \mathcal{O}_X(A)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Consider the model of differential cohesion given by $\mathbf{H}_{th} =$ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]]. Write $\Omega^1 \in \mathbf{H }\stackrel{i_!}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}_{th}$ for the abstract [[sheaf]] of [[differential 1-forms]]. 

Then for $X \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ a [[smooth manifold]], we have that 

$$

  \underset{X}{\sum} \iota \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1) \to X
$$

is the [[cotangent bundle]]

$$
  T^* X \to X
$$

of the manifold: because for $i_U \colon U \to X$ an open subset of the manifold regarded as an object of $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$, a section $\iota(\sigma_U)$ of $T^* X|_U \to U$ is equivalently a map $\sigma \colon i_U \to \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1)$ in $Sh_{\mathbf{H}_{th}}(X)$, which by the $(\iota \dashv Et)$-[[adjunction]] is a map $\iota(i_U) \to X \times \Omega^1$ in $(\mathbf{H}_{th})_{/X}$ which finally is equivalently a map $U \to \Omega^1$ in $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ hence an element in $\Omega^1(U)$.


So the Liouville-Poincaré $\Omega^1$-cocycle according to \ref{TheLiouvillePoincareCocycle} is a [[differential 1-form]] 

$$
  \theta
  \;\colon\;
  \underset{X}{\sum}\iota \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1)
  \to 
  \Omega^1

on the total space of the cotangent bundle. For

$$
  \sigma \;\colon\; X \to \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1)
  \;\;\;
  \in Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)
$$

a [[section]] of the [[cotangent bundle]], the [[pullback of a differential form|pullback form]] $\sigma^* \theta$ on $X$ is the composite

$$
  \underset{X}{\sum}\iota X \stackrel{\underset{X}{\sum}\iota(\sigma)}{\to} \underset{X}{\sum}\iota \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1) \stackrel{\theta}{\to} \Omega^1
 \,,
$$

hence the [[adjunct]]

$$
  \iota X \stackrel{\iota(\sigma)}{\to} \iota \mathcal{O}_X(\Omega^1) \stackrel{}{\to} X^* \Omega^1
  \,,
$$

hence by definition

$$
  \iota(X) \stackrel{\iota(\sigma)}{\to} \iota(Et(X \times \Omega^1)) \stackrel{}{\to} X^*\Omega^1

$$

hence the adjunct

$$
  X \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} Et(X \times \Omega^1) \stackrel{id}{\to} Et(X \times \Omega^1)
$$

hence the original $\sigma$. This is the defining property which identifies $\that$ as the traditional [[Liouville-Poincaré 1-form]].

Since the identity on $X$ is formally étale, This we may regard as a section of the $G$-valued flat cotangent sheaf, def. \ref{CotangentBundle},

if $\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{inf}}(X) \simeq *$ then already $i^* X = \Pi_{\mathrm{inf}}(X) \simeq *$.
Since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}} \simeq \Pi_{\mathbf{H}} \Pi_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and 
$\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}$ preserves the terminal object by cohesiveness, this implies the first claim.
 
The second statement follows by 
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma X & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(*,X)
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(\mathbf{Red}*, X)
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(*, \mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{inf}}(X))
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{th}}(*,*)
     \\
     & \simeq *
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

###### Observation

For all $X \in \mathbf{H}$, we have that $X$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ are [formal cohesive ∞-groupoids](#InfinitesimalObject) over $X$, the first by the constant infinitesmal path inclusion, the second by the identity.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $X$ this is tautological, for $\mathbf{\Pi}(X)$ it follows from the [idempotency of Red](#RedIsIdempotent) and the $(i^* \dashv i_*)$-[[zig-zag identity]].

###### Proposition

The [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}\mathfrak{g}$ of an [formal cohesive ∞-group](#InfinitesimalObject) $\mathfrak{g}$ is an [[formal cohesive ∞-groupoid]] over the point.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since both $i^*$ and $i_*$ are [[right adjoint]], the [infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid functor](#InfinitesimalPathsAndReduction) commutes with [[delooping]]. Therefore 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \mathbf{B}\mathfrak{g}
    & \simeq
    \mathbf{B} \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \mathfrak{g}
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{B} *
    \\
    & \simeq *
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} *
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

An [infinitesimal cohesive ∞-groupoid](#InfinitesimalObject) 
$X \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ is both [geometrically contractible](#ExponentiatedLieAsGeometricallyContractible) and has as underlying [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] the point:

* $\Pi X \simeq *$

* $\Gamma X \simeq *$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows with using the [above observation](#InfinitesimalInclusionIfFullAndFaithful) from the full and faithfulness of $i_!$ and $i_*$.

The former implies that with $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) \simeq *$ already $i^*X  = \Pi_{inf}X = *$. Since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}_{th}} \simeq \Pi_{\mathbf{H}} \Pi_{inf}$ and since $\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}$ preserves the point by cohesiveness, this implies the first claim.

For the latter we compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma X & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(*,X)
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(\mathbf{Red}*, X)
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X))
     \\
     & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(*,*)
     \\
     & \simeq *
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

For $C^{op}$ any [[(∞,1)-site]] the construction of the 
[[tangent (∞,1)-category]] $T_{C} \to C$ provides a canonical infinitesimal thickening of $C$:


$$
  C
  \stackrel{\overset{cod}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\to}}{\underset{dom}{\leftarrow}}}
  C^{\Delta[1]}
  \stackrel{\overset{L}{\to}}{\underset{\Omega^\infty}{\leftarrow}}  
  \,,
$$

where the $\infty$-functor pair on the right forms a 
$cod$-[[relative (∞,1)-adjunction]]. The composite $L \circ i$ is the [[cotangent complex]] functor for $C$ and $\Omega^\infty$ is fiberwise the canonical map out of the [[stabilization]].

The image of $i$ is contained in that of $\Omega^\infty$. Therefore we may restrict the $(cod \dashv i)$-adjunction on the right to the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] $\tilde T_C$ of $C^{\Delta[1]}$ on thise objects in the image of $\Omega^\infty$. This yields an infinitesimal neighbourhood of [[(∞,1)-sites]]

$$
  C^{op}
  \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{cod}{\leftarrow}}
  (\tilde T_C)^{op}
