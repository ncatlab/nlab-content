This entry is to record the reference

* [[Shiing-shen Chern]], [[James Simons]], _Characteristic forms and geometric invariants_     The Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 99, No. 1 (1974) ([jstor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1971013)).

This is the origin of the notion of [[Chern-Simons form]]s and their conception as [[secondary characteristic class]]es, which led to the refinement of the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] by [[Cheeger-Simons differential character]]s. 

This is also where _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_ derives its name from.
