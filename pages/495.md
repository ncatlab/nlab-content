## Idea

An [[object]] of a [[category]] is _internally projective_ if it satisfies the [[internalization]] of the condition on a [[projective object]].

## Definition

An object $E$ of a [[topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ is called **internally projective** if the [[internal hom]]/[[exponential object]] [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^E \colon \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T}
$$ 

preserves [[epimorphisms]].  

## Properties

If the terminal object in $\mathcal{T}$ is [[projective object|projective]], then every internally projective object is projective. Conversely,

###### Proposition 
If $\mathcal{T}$ has [[projective object|enough projectives]] and projectives are closed under binary products, then every projective object is internally projective. (In particular, if all objects of $\mathcal{T}$ are projective then all objects are internally projective.)

The _internal axiom of choice_ (that is, the [[axiom of choice]] interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of the topos) is equivalent to the statement that every object is internally projective.  This is strictly weaker than the "external" axiom of choice that every [[epimorphism]] in the topos is [[split epimorphism|split]].
