## Idea

An [[object]] of a [[category]] is _internally projective_ if it satisfies the [[internalization]] of the condition on a [[projective object]].

## Definition

An object $E$ of a [[topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ is called **internally projective** if the [[internal hom]]/[[exponential object]] [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^E \colon \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T}
$$ 

preserves [[epimorphisms]].  

## Properties

If the terminal object in $\mathcal{T}$ is [[projective object|projective]], then every internally projective object is projective. In the converse direction,

###### Proposition 
If $\mathcal{T}$ has [[projective object|enough projectives]] and projectives are closed under binary products, then every projective object is internally projective. (In particular, if all objects of $\mathcal{T}$ are projective then all objects are internally projective.)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Let $P$ be a projective object. To show that $e^P \colon E^P \to B^P$ is epic whenever $e \colon E \to B$ is epic, choose an epi $\phi \colon P' \to B^P$ where $P'$ is projective (using the assumption of enough projectives). Since $P \times P'$ is projective, there exists a lift through $e$ of the horizontal composite as shown: 

$$\array{
 & & & & E \\
 & & & & \downarrow ^\mathrlap{e} \\ 
P' \times P & \underset{\phi \times 1}{\to} & B^P \times P & \underset{eval}{\to} & B; 
}$$ 

this, by [[currying]], provides a lift of $\phi \colon P' \to B^P$ through $e^P$. Since $\phi$ is epic, this immediately implies $e^P$ is epic, as desired.

###### Remark 
Proposition \ref{enough} may fail without the assumption that projective objects are closed under binary products. An example is given [here](/nlab/show/presentation+axiom#counter).

###### Remark 
The _internal axiom of choice_ (that is, the [[axiom of choice]] interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of the topos) is equivalent to the statement that every object is internally projective.  This is strictly weaker than the "external" axiom of choice that every [[epimorphism]] in the topos is [[split epimorphism|split]].

###### Corollary 
In a presheaf topos $Set^{C^{op}}$, if $C$ has binary products, then every projective presheaf is internally projective. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Representables, and arbitrary coproducts of representables, are projective, and every presheaf is covered by some coproduct of representables. This implies that projective presheaves are precisely retracts of coproducts of representables. Under the assumption that $C$ has binary products, coproducts of representables, and also their retracts, are also closed under binary products. Thus projective presheaves are closed under binary products. Now apply Proposition \ref{enough}.
