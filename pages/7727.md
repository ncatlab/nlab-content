## Idea

The [[orthogonal group]] $O(n,n)$ for signature $(n,n)$ is sometimes called the _Narain group_ or _generalized T-duality group_ for the role that it plays in [[T-duality]] of [[type II string theory]]. See also at _[[type II geometry]]_.

## Properties

### Structure group of generalized tangent bundle

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], the [[generalized tangent bundle]] $T X \oplus T^* X$ has as [[structure group]] the Narain group.

### Maximal compact subgroup

The [[maximal compact subgroup]] of the Narain group is the product group $O(n) \times O(n)$. A [[reduction of the structure group]]  of the [[generalized tangent bundle]] along the inclusion defines a [[type II geometry]].
