## Idea

A [[field]] $k$ is __algebraically closed__ if every non-constant [[polynomial]] (with one variable and coefficients from $k$) has a root in $k$.  It follows that every polynomial of degree $n$ can be factored uniquely (up to [[permutation]] of the factors) as
$$ p = c \prod_{i = 1}^n (\mathrm{x} - a_i) ,$$
where $c$ and the $a_i$ are elements of $k$.

The __[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]__ is, classically, the statement that the [[complex number]]s form an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{C}$.  Arguably, this theorem is not entirely algebraic; the algebraic portion is that $R[\mathrm{i}]$ is algebraically closed whenever $R$ is a [[real-closed field]].  Unusually, this algebraic portion is *not* (as stated) valid in [[constructive mathematics]], while the analytic result (that the [[real numbers]] form a real closed field $\mathbb{R}$) is constructively valid with the usual definitions.

An __algebraic closure__ of an arbitrary field $k$ is an algebraically closed field $\bar{k}$ equipped with a field homomorphism (necessarily an [[injection]]) $i: k \to \bar{k}$ such that $\bar{k}$ is an [[algebraic extension]] of $k$ (which means that every element of $\bar{k}$ is the root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients only from $k$). For example, $\mathbb{C}$ is an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$.   An algebraic closure of $k$ can also be described as a maximal algebraic extension of $k$.  The [[axiom of choice]] proves the existence of $\bar{k}$ for any field $k$, as well as its uniqueness up to [[isomorphism]] over $k$.  (See [[splitting field]] for a more refined result.) However, note that $\bar{k}$ need not be unique up to *unique* isomorphism, so it\'s not really appropriate to speak of [[the]] algebraic closure of $k$.  For example, complex conjugation is a nontrivial [[automorphism]] of $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{R}$.

## Classical invariants 

Putting aside the concerns of constructive mathematics, and freely adopting the principle of the [[excluded middle]] and the [[axiom of choice]], algebraically closed fields are characterized (up to non-unique isomorphism) by just two cardinal invariants: 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
Two algebraically closed fields $K, K'$ are isomorphic iff they have the same characteristic $p$ (the nonnegative generator of the [[kernel]] of the unique [[ring]] map $\mathbb{Z} \to K$) and the same [[transcendence degree]] (the [[cardinality]] of any maximal set of algebraically independent elements). 
=-- 

In outline, the proof is simple in structure. The "only if" statement is clear, provided we allow that transcendence degree is _well-defined_. For the "if" statement, $K$ contains a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/(p)[S]$ where $S$ is a transcendence basis, and similarly $K'$ contains a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/(p)[S']$. By hypothesis, there is a bijection $f: S \to S'$, which extends uniquely to an isomorphism of [[integral domains]] $\mathbb{Z}/(p)[S] \to \mathbb{Z}/(p)[S']$, which extends uniquely to an isomorphism of their fields of fractions $\mathbb{F}(S) \to \mathbb{F}(S')$. Then $K, K'$ are algebraic closures of these fields, and one applies a theorem that an isomorphism of fields $\mathbb{F}(S) \to \mathbb{F}(S')$ can be extended to an isomorphism $K \to K'$ of their algebraic closures. 

The full details of such a proof carry some themes important in [[model theory]]: 

* There is a notion of algebraic closure of a subset, 

* There are prime models (algebraic closure of prime field $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$), 

* There are notions of independence and basis, and well-defined degree or dimension, 

* There are extensions of isomorphisms of independent sets to isomorphisms of their algebraic closures. 

Perhaps the most subtle in the list is the notion of independence and well-definedness of (transcendence) degree, which notably involves verification of the Steinitz exchange axiom:

###### Lemma 
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field, and let $cl: P(K) \to P(K)$ be the operator that takes a subset $S \subseteq K$ to the smallest algebraically closed subfield that contains $S$. Then $cl$ is a [[geometric stability theory|pregeometry]].

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For the moment, please consult Jacobson, Basic Algebra II, Theorem 8.34. This may be expanded upon a little later.

Well-definedness of transcendence degree then follows from abstract considerations of pregeometries; see [this result](/nlab/show/matroid#welldefined).
