## Idea

The _Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture_ states that, given a [[symplectic manifold]] equipped with a [[Hamiltonian action]] by some group, under suitable conditions the processes of [[geometric quantization]] and of [[symplectic reduction]] can be interchanged without changing the result (a [[representation]] of the [[group]] on the [[space of quantum states]]). This is usually abbreviated to: _quantization commutes with reduction_.

The original article ([Guillemin-Sternberg 82](#GuilleminSternberg82)) proved this statement for the case of [[compact Lie groups]] acting on [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifolds]] and for [[geometric quantization]] via [[Kähler polarizations]].

For the more powerful and more flexible [[geometric quantization by push-forward]], the corresponding statement is widely known as the _Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture_.  Since its formulation, this, too, has been proven in fair generality, see the [References](#References) below.
