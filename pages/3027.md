## Idea

A notion of [[infinite-dimensional manifold]].
A __Banach manifold__ is a [[manifold]] modelled on [[Banach spaces]].  By default, transition maps are taken to be [[smooth map|smooth]].

## Properties

### Embedding into the category of diffeological spaces

The category of smooth Banach manifolds has a [[full and faithful functor]] into the category of [[diffeological spaces]]. In terms of Chen smooth spaces this was observed in ([Hain](#Hain)).

## Related concepts

* [[Hilbert manifold]]

* [[ILH manifold]]

* [[Frechet manifold]]
