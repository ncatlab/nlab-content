The term **filtrant category** is another term for [[filtered category]].

The term "filtrant category" is used for instance in Kashiwara-Schapira's book [[Categories and Sheaves]].

I don\'t see the point of putting this information here, of commenting the redirect.  We don\'t really want any links to point here, since people will just need to push on to the other page to read the content.  So nobody will read this comment!  We ought to move the comment to the redirect target (which I did) and make this a straightforward redirect page.

This is different from when the two terms are real variations with their own definitions etc, even if they somehow correspond.  If that were the case, then sometimes we would want to point here, even if most of the discussion is at the other page.  And in particular, the target page would have a link back here, so it would get seen!  (Compare how [[2-category]] and [[bicategory]] link to each other.)

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Makes sense to me.  I am still hoping that one day we can get mediawiki-style redirects that don't require an extra click from the user.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: sure, sounds very reasonable
