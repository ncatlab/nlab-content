## Overview

The Initiality Project is a communal effort to prove an [[initiality theorem]] for a [[dependent type theory]]: that the categorical structure constructed out of the syntax is the [[initial object]] in some category of [[categorical model of dependent types|structured categorical objects]].

## Plans and work

* [[Initiality Project - Overview|Overview]] -- currently a proposal, under discussion.
* [[Initiality Project - Raw Syntax|Raw Syntax]]
* [[Initiality Project - Type Theory|Type Theory]] -- the judgments of our type theory
* [[Initiality Project - Semantics|Semantics]] -- the categorical structures in which we interpret type theory
* [[Initiality Project - Partial Interpretation|Partial interpretation function]]
* [[Initiality Project - Preservation of Substitution|Preservation of Substitution]]
* [[Initiality Project - Totality|Totality of the interpretation]]
* [[Initiality Project - Term Model|The Term Model]]
* [[Initiality Project - Interpretation Functor|The interpretation as a functor]]
* [[Initiality Project - Uniqueness|Uniqueness of the interpretation functor]]

### By type former

* [[Initiality Project - Pi-types]]

## Jobs and volunteers

Here are the tasks to be done.  To volunteer for a task, edit the page and put your name after it.

* Create skeletons for all the pages and list the tasks to be done ([[Mike Shulman]])
* Define $\alpha$-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution in [[Initiality Project - Raw Syntax]] ([[John Dougherty]])
* Define a morphism of CwFs in [[Initiality Project - Semantics]].
* Define $\Pi$-type structure on a CwF in [[Initiality Project - Semantics - Pi-types]].
* Write out the equality rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]].
* Define signatures to give arities to constants, and write out the constant rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]].
* Write out the $\Pi$-type congruence rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory - Pi-types]].
* Prove some admissible rules, etc. at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]].
