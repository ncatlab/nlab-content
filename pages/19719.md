## Overview

The Initiality Project is a communal effort to prove an [[initiality theorem]] for a [[dependent type theory]]: that the categorical structure constructed out of the syntax is the [[initial object]] in some category of [[categorical model of dependent types|structured categorical objects]].

## Plans and work

* [[Initiality Project - Overview|Overview]] -- currently a proposal, under discussion.
* [[Initiality Project - Raw Syntax|Raw Syntax]]
* [[Initiality Project - Type Theory|Type Theory]] -- the judgments of our type theory
* [[Initiality Project - Semantics|Semantics]] -- the categorical structures in which we interpret type theory
* [[Initiality Project - Partial Interpretation|Partial interpretation function]]
* [[Initiality Project - Substitution|Preservation of Substitution]]
* [[Initiality Project - Totality|Totality of the interpretation]]
* [[Initiality Project - Term Model|The Term Model]]
* [[Initiality Project - Functor|The interpretation as a functor]]
* [[Initiality Project - Uniqueness|Uniqueness of the interpretation functor]]

## Jobs and volunteers

Here are the tasks to be done.  To volunteer for a task, edit the page and put your name after it.  Some tasks have many sub-tasks (e.g. each of the 8-ish rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory - Pi-types]] requires its own inductive clause at [[Initiality Project - Totality - Pi-types]]), so feel free to split up the tasks listed below and volunteer at as small a level of granularity as you wish.

* Create skeletons for all the pages and list the tasks to be done ([[Mike Shulman]])
* Define $\alpha$-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution in [[Initiality Project - Raw Syntax]] ([[John Dougherty]])
* Define a morphism of CwFs in [[Initiality Project - Semantics]] ([[Paolo Capriotti]]).
* Define $\Pi$-type structure on a CwF in [[Initiality Project - Semantics - Pi-types]].
* Write out the equality rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]] ([[Kenji Maillard]]).
* Define signatures to give arities to constants, and write out the constant rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]].
* Write out the $\Pi$-type congruence rules at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory - Pi-types]].
* Prove some admissible rules, etc. at [[Initiality Project - Type Theory]].
* Define the partial interpretation on $\Pi,\lambda,App$ at [[Initiality Project - Partial Interpretation - Pi-types]].
* Prove local totality for the variable rule at [[Initiality Project - Totality]].
* Prove local totality for the mode-switching rule at [[Initiality Project - Totality]].
* Prove local totality for the equality rules at [[Initiality Project - Totality]].
* Prove local totality for $\Pi,\lambda,App$ at [[Initiality Project - Totality - Pi-types]].
* Create, update and maintain a bibliography ([[Initiality Project - References]]), ([[Initiality Project - BibTeX database]] for the project and link it to existing material.
