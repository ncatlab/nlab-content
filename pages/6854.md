__Complex analysis__ is the mathematical [[analysis]] of complex valued functions of a complex variable, of several complex variables or a function on a complex analytic manifold. While a [[complex number]] variable can be understood as a pair of real numbers, this would naively reduce to analysis of pairs of functions of even number of real variables; however by complex analysis we mean mathematical analysis which takes into account limits and derivative which do not depend on the real line in a complex plane on which we approach a point. This leads to the notions of [[holomorphic function]], [[meromorphic function]] etc. which are the main subject of the complex analysis.
