## Definition

Generally in [[category theory]] a _coprojection_ is one of the canonical [[morphisms]] $p_i$ into a (categorical) [[coproduct]]:

$$
  p_i \colon X_i \to \coprod_j X_j
  \,.
$$


or, more generally into a [[colimit]] 

$$
  p_i \colon X_i \to \underset{\rightarrow_j}{\lim} X_j
  \,.
$$

Hence a coprojection is a component of a [[colimit|colimiting]] _[[cocone]]_ under a given [[diagram]].

Coprojections are also sometimes called *coproduct injections* or *inclusions*, though in general they are not [[monomorphisms]] (see below).

## Properties

### Monicity

In general, the coprojections of a coproduct need not be [[monomorphisms]].  However, they are in certain common situations, such as:

* In a [[distributive category]]; see [[toddtrimble:distributivity implies monicity of coproduct inclusions]].

* In a category with [[zero morphisms]], since then they are [[split monomorphisms]].

It is easy to find examples of categories in which the coprojections of coproducts are not monic, e.g. the projection $\emptyset \times A\to A$ in $Set$ is not epic if $A$ is nonempty, so when regarded as a coprojection in $Set^{op}$ it is not monic.  It is somewhat trickier to find examples of [[closed monoidal categories]] with this property, but [[Chu spaces]] give an example; see [this MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/208375/a-cosmos-where-coproduct-injections-are-not-monic).
