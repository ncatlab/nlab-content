## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a coarse structure on a set $X$
is a subset $C\subset P(X\times X)$ that contains the diagonal of $X$ and is closed under finite
unions, subsets, compositions, and inverses.
(Composition is given by the fiber product over $X$,
whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors of $X$.)

The elements of $C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
