## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a _coarse structure_ on a [[set]] $X$ is a [[subset]] $C\subset P(X\times X)$ (of the [[power set]] of the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with itself)  that contains the [[diagonal]] of $X$ and is closed under finite [[unions]], subsets, relational compositions, and relational inverses. (Here composition is given by the [[fiber product]] over $X$, whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors of $X$.)

The elements of $C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
