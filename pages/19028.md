## Idea

A kind of analogue of [[lattice gauge theory]] for [[worldsheet]] computations in [[perturbative string theory]]/[[string scattering amplitudes]].

## Properties 


### Via single trace observables under AdS/CFT
 {#ViaSingleTraceObservablesUnderAdSCFT}

From the point of view of [[AdS-CFT|AdS/CFT-duality]], string bit observables are the incarnation of [[single trace observables]] on the [[CFT]]-side [Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase 02, p. 13](single+trace+observable#BerensteinMaldacenaNastase02).

More in detail:

The [[single trace observables|single trace operators/observables]] in [[conformal field theories]] such as [[super Yang-Mills theories]] play a special role in the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]]: They correspond to single [[string]] excitations on the [[AdS spacetime|AdS]]-[[supergravity]] side of the correspondence, where, curiously, the "string of characters/letters" in the argument of the trace gets literally mapped to a [[superstring]] in [[spacetime]] (see the references [below](#ReferencesRelationToStringExcitations)).

From [Polyakov 02](single+trace+observable#Polyakov02), referring to gauge fields and their single trace operators as _letter_ and _words_, respectively:

> The picture which slowly arises from the above considerations is that of the space-time gradually disappearing in the regions of large curvature. The natural description in this case is provided by a gauge theory in which the basic objects are the texts formed from the gauge-invariant words. The theory provides us with the expectation values assigned to the various texts, words and sentences.


> These expectation values can be calculated either from the gauge theory or from the strongly coupled 2d sigma model. The coupling in this model is proportional to the target space curvature. This target space can be interpreted as a usual continuous space-time only when the curvature is small. As we increase the coupling, this interpretation becomes more and more fuzzy and finally completely meaningless. 

From [Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase 02](single+trace+observable#BerensteinMaldacenaNastase02), who write $Z$ for the elementary [[field observables]] ("letters") $\mathbf{\Phi}$ above:

> In summary, the "string of $Z$s" becomes the physical string and that each $Z$ carries one unit of $J$ which is one unit of $p_+$. Locality along the worldsheet of the string comes from the fact that planar diagrams allow only contractions of neighboring operators. So the Yang Mills theory gives a [[string bit model]] where each bit is a $Z$ operator. 

On the [[CFT]] side these _[[BMN operators]]_ of fixed length (of "letters") are usefully identified as  [[spin chains]] which, with the [[dilatation operator]] regarded as their [[Hamiltonian]], are [[integrable systems]] ([Minahan-Zarembo 02](single+trace+observable#MinahanZarembo02), [Beisert-Staudacher 03](single+trace+observable#BeisertStaudacher03)).

This integrability allows a detailed matching between 

* [[single trace operators]]/[[BMN operators]] in [[D=4 N=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] 

* the [[classical field theory|classical]] [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] on [[anti de Sitter spacetime|AdS5]] $\times$ [[5-sphere|S5]]

under [[AdS/CFT duality]] ([Beisert-Frolov-Staudacher-Tseytlin 03](single+trace+observable#BeisertFrolovStaudacherTseytlin03), ...). For review see [BBGK 04](single+trace+observable#BBGK04), [Beisert et al. 10](single+trace+observable#BeisertEtAl10).
