## Idea

A _derived loop space_ is a [[free loop space object]] in [[derived geometry]].

## Definition

Let $T$ be an [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]] and $C \subset T Alg_\infty^{op}$ an [[(∞,1)-site]] of [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of $\infty$-algebras over $T$. Then the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} = (\infty,1) Sh(C)$ encodes [[derived geometry]] modeled on $T$. 

A **derived loop space** is a [[free loop space object]] in such $\mathbf{H}$.

More specifically, if $T$ is an ordinary [[Lawvere theory]], regarded as a 1-truncated $(\infty,1)$-theory, then $T Alg_{\infty}$ are its simplicial algebras. There is a canonical embedding $T Alg^{op} \hookrightarrow T Alg_\infty^{op}$ of the ordinary algebras into the $\infty$-algebras, so that we may regard $X \in T Alg^{op}$ as an object of $\mathbf{H}$. Then the _derived loop space_ of $X$ is its [[free loop space object]] computed in $\mathbf{H}$.

The point is that the derived loop space of an ordinary $X \in T Alg^{op}$ in general is a significantly richer object than the free loop space object of $X$ as computed just in the underived $(\inftym1)$-topos $(\infty,1)Sh(T Alg^{op})$. In fact, since $X$ is 0-[[truncated]] in $(\infty,1)Sh(T Alg^{op})$, its coincides with its free loop space object there. But the derived loop space does not.

## Function complexes on derived loop spaces: Hochschild homology

The function complex on the derived loop space $\mathcal{L}X$ is the [[Hochschild homology]] complex of $C(X)$. See there for further details.

    This article uses To&euml;n's theory of [[function algebras on ∞-stacks]] for showing that the function complex on a derived loop space $\mathcal{L}X$ is under mild conditions the [[Hochschild homology]] complex of $X$ hence by [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem]] the collection of [[Kähler differential]] forms on $X$, and that the functions on $\mathcal{L}X$ that are invariant under the canonical $S^1$-[[action]] on $\mathcal{L}X$ are the _closed_ forms. This also gives a geometric interpretation of the old observation by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and others, that the differential and grading on the de Rham complex may be understood as induced from automorphisms of the [[odd line]].
