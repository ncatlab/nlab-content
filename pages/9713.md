## Definition


A _monoidal (2,1)-category_ is a [[(2,1)-category]] equipped equivalently with the following structure

* when regarded as a [[2-category]] the structure of a [[monoidal 2-category]];

* when regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]] the structure of a [[monoidal (∞,1)-category]].


Similarly:

A _symmetric monoidal (2,1)-category_ is a [[(2,1)-category]] equipped equivalently with the following structure

* when regarded as a [[2-category]] the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal 2-category]];

* when regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]] the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]].
