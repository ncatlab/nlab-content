A __skew-commutative algebra__ is a [[graded object|graded]] [[associative algebra|algebra]] $A$ (with the product often written as $\wedge$) such that

*  $x \wedge y = (-1)^{pq}\, y \wedge x$ whenever $x$ is in grade $p$ and $y$ is in grade $q$.

Actually, there is a _twisted [[tensor product]]_ on the category $Gr Mod$ of graded modules such that a skew-commutative algebra is really a [[commutative algebra]] (that is an [[abelian monoid|abelian]] [[monoid object]]) in $Gr Mod$, but I forget how that goes.
