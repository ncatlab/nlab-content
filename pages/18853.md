## Idea

The _Lamb shift_ is a tiny shift in the [[energy]] spectrum of excitations of the [[electron]] orbits in the [[hydrogen atom]].

This is a "fine structure" effect not seen by the [[quantum mechanics]] of the [[electron]], but resulting from higher order corrections only seen by regadring the electron in [[perturbative quantum field theory]], here in [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The Lamb shift may be attributed to a variety of [[loop order|1-loop]] [[Feynman diagrams]] contributions  which add corrections to the basic [[tree level]] vertex describing the interaction of the electron with the [[background field|background]] [[electromagnetic field]], hence called _vertex corrections_.

In fact, historically, the observation of the Lamb shift in [[experiment]] catalyzed the theoretic develeopment of [[quantum electrodynamics]] specifically and of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] generally.
