## Idea

The _Lamb shift_ is a shift in the energy spectrum of excitations of the [[electron]] orbits in the [[hydrogen atom]] which is caused by coupling of the electron in [[quantum electrodynamics]].

In fact, historically, the observation of the Lamb shift in [[experiment]] catalyzed the theoretic develeopment of [[QED]] specifically and of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] generally.
