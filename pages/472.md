#Definition#

For $C$ a [[category]], a **cylinder functor** on $C$ is a [[functor]] denoted

$$
  (-)\times I : C \to C
$$

equipped with three natural transformations

$$
  e_0, e_1 : Id_C \to (-)\times I
$$
$$
 \sigma : (-)\times I \to Id_C
$$
such that $\sigma e_0 = \sigma e_1 = Id_C$.

#Remarks#

* A cylinder functor functorially provides _[[cylinder objects]]_ used for talking about [[homotopy]].

* The notation is supposed to be suggestive of a [[product]] with an object $I$. While this is the motivating example, the interval functor need not be of that form.

##Cylindrical model structures

[[Richard Williamson]] has developed a way to build a model structure from the simple point of departure of a structured interval in a monoidal category - more generally, a structured cylinder and a structured co-cylinder in a category. This is given in his [thesis](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/cylindrical_model_structures.pdf) and also in the ArXiv article listed below.
