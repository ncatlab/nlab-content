## Idea

The relative complement of $A$ in $B$ is like the [[complement]] of $A$, but relative to $B$.


## Definitions

### For subsets

Given two [[subset]]s $S$ and $T$ of a given ambient [[set]] $X$, the __relative complement__ of $S$ in $T$ is the set
$$ T \setminus S = \{ a \;|\; a \in T \;\wedge\; a \notin S \} .$$
That is, $T \setminus S$ consists of those elements of $T$ that are not elements of $S$.

Note that the relative complement of $S$ in the ambient set $X$ is simply the [[complement]] $\setminus S$ of $S$; sometimes this is called the _absolute_ complement.  Conversely, $T \setminus S$ is the [[intersection]] of $T$ and $\setminus S$.


### In material set theory

In [[material set theory]], all sets are subsets of the [[proper class]] $V$ of all sets (or all small things, if we might have atoms).  In this case, there is no absolute complement (except as another proper class), but we can still form the relative complement:
$$ T \setminus S = \{ a \in T \;|\; a \notin S \} .$$


### In a lattice

Given a [[lattice]] $L$ and two elements $x$ and $y$ of $L$, a __relative complement__ of $x$ in $y$ in an element $y \setminus x$ such that:
*  $ x \wedge (y \setminus x) = \bot $ (where $\wedge$ is the [[meet]] in the lattice and $\bot$ is the [[bottom]] of the lattice) and
*  $ y \leq x \vee (y \setminus x) $ (where $\vee$ is the [[join]] in the lattice).

The term _Boolean ring_ is sometimes used for something like a [[Boolean algebra]] in which there may be no [[top]] element (and therefore no complements) but still relative complements; compare the notions of _ring_ vs _algebra_ at [[sigma-algebra]].

This includes the previous examples; the [[power set]] of $X$ is a [[Boolean algebra]], while the class of all sets is (in this sense) a Boolean ring.
