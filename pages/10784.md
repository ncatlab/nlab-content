## Idea

The _pro-étale site_ is a variant of the [[étale site]] where the finitess conditions on the [[fibers]] of [[étale morphisms of schemes|étale morphisms]] is relaxed to a 
[[pro-object|pro-]]finitenss condition ([[pro-étale morphism of schemes|pro-étale morphisms]])

The [[sheaf topos]] over the pro-étale site might by called the _pro-[[étale topos]]_. Its [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _pro étale cohomology_ -- improves on that of the original [[étale topos]] in that it genuinely contains ([Bhatt-Scholze 13](#BhattScholze13)) the [[Weil cohomology theory]] called [[ℓ-adic cohomology]] (while over the [[étale site]] this is only given by an [[inverse limit]] of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]).

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro étale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[pro-étale morphisms]] into $X$ and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

## Properties

### In terms of weakly étale maps

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ of [[schemes]]
is called _weakly étale_ if 

1. $f$ is a [[flat morphism of schemes]];

1. its [[diagonal]] $X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X$ is also flat.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro étale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[weakly étale morphisms]] into $X$ (hence weakly étale $X$-schemes) and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

### Generation by w-contractible rings

+-- {: .num_defn #wContractible}
###### Definition

A [[commutative ring]] $R$ is a **[[w-contractible ring]]** if every [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]] [[pro-étale morphism]] $Spec A \to Spec R$ has a [[section]].

=--

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, def. 2.4.1](#BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every [[commutative ring]] $R$, there is a a w-contractible $A$, def. \ref{wContractible},
equipped with a [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]] [[pro-étale morphism]] $Spec A \to Spec R$.

=--

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, lemma 2.4.9](#BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

So the [[full subcategory]] on the [[w-contractible rings]] forms a [[dense subsite]] of the pro-étale site, consisting of objects with [[contractible]] pro-[[étale homotopy type]].

=--

### Relation to the étale topos


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Since every [[étale morphism of schemes]] is in particular a [[pro-étale morphism of schemes|pro étale morphism]], there is induced a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  \nu
  \;\colo\;
  Sh(X_{proet})
  \longrightarrow
  Sh(X_{et})
$$

from the [[pro-étale topos]] to the [[étale topos]] of any [[scheme]] $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$\nu$ is a [[surjective geometric morphism]] with [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[inverse image]]. Hence the ordinary [[étale topos]] is a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflection]] of the pro-étale topos.
