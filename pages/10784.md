## Idea

A variant of the [[étale site]] where the finitess conditions on [[étale morphisms]] are relaxed.

The resulting [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _prop étale cohomology_ -- has a good relation to [[ℓ-adic cohomology]].

## References

The pro-étale topology was suggested by Scholze and then fully developed in
