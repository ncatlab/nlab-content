

There exists a [[motive]] $\mathbf{L}$, called the _Lefschetz motive_, such that the motive of the [[projective line]] decomposes as

$$h(\mathbf{P}^1_k) = h(\Spec(k)) \oplus \mathbf{L}$$

Formally inverting the Lefschetz motive in the category of effective pure motives yields the category of [[pure motives]].
