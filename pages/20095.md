## Idea

Composite Higgs Models are speculative [[models (in theoretical physics)]] which explore the possibility that the [[Higgs boson]] is not fundamental, but a [[bound state]] in a more fundamental [[non-perturbative effect|strongly interacting sector]] beyond the current [[standard model of particle physics]] which gives rise to [[electro-weak symmetry breaking]].

While the measurement of the apparent [[Higgs boson]] at the [[LHC]] strongly disfavours [[technicolor]] models (which is the other main class of models where the Higgs field is not actually fundamental), composite Higgs models are still viable. They are commonly argued to be an alternative to [[supersymmetry]] with regards to the [[naturalness]]-issue, and the have been argued to possibly explain the observer [[flavour anomalies]] (see the references [below](#FlavourAnomalies)).
