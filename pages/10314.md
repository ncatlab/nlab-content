Given a smooth Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with complex structure $j$, and an almost complex manifold $M$ with almost complex structure $J$, a pseudoholomorphic curve is a smooth map
$f:\Sigma\to M$ whose differential commutes with the almost complex structure in the sense that the equation
$$
J\circ d f = d f\circ j
$$
holds. One can also consider a symplectic manifold $(N,\omega)$ instead of $M$, in which case on chooses an almost complex structure compatible with the symplectic form $\omega$.

A more general notion is of a pseudoholomorphic map.
