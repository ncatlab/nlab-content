## Idea

A _Lie groupoid_ is a [[groupoid]] with smooth structure The notion of Lie groupoid is the groupoid analog of [[Lie group]].

## Definition

A Lie groupoid is an [[internal category|internal groupoid]] in [[Diff]]. One can define a Lie groupoid to be an [[Ehresmann internal category|internal groupoid in the sense of Ehresmann]], which includes as data the manifold of composable pairs, or take the conventional route and specify that the source and target maps are [[submersion]]s. This ensures the [[pullback]] exists to define said manifold or composable pairs.

Note that originally Lie groupoids were called _differentiable groupoids_ (and also one considered differentiable _categories_). Sometime in the 1980s there was a change of terminology. (reference?)

### Specialisations

One definition which Ehresmann introduced in his paper _Catégories topologiques et catégories différentiables_ (see below) is that of [[locally trivial category|locally trivial groupoid]]. It is defined more generally for topological categories, and extends in an obvious way to topological groupoids, and Lie categories and groupoids. For a topological (resp. Lie) category $X$, let $X_1^{iso}$ denote the subspace (resp. submanifold) of invertible arrows . (This always exists, by general abstract nonsense - I should look up the reference, it's in Bunge-Pare I think - [[David Roberts|DR]])

###### Definition 
A topological groupoid $X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ is **locally trivial** if for every point $p\in X_0$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ and a lift of the inclusion $\{p\} \times U \hookrightarrow X_0 \times X_0$ through $(s,t):X_1^{iso}\to X_0 \times X_0$. 
=--

Clearly for a Lie groupoid $X_1^{iso} = X_1$. It is simple to show from the definition that for a transitive Lie groupoid, $(s,t)$ has local sections. Ehresmann goes on to show a link between smooth [[principal bundles]] and transitive, locally trivial Lie groupoids. See [[locally trivial category]] for details.

## Lie algebroids

As the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]] approximation to a [[Lie group]] is a [[Lie algebra]], so the infinitesimal approximation to a Lie groupoid is a [[Lie algebroid]].
