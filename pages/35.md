## Idea

A _Lie groupoid_ is a [[groupoid]] [[internal groupoid|internal]] to [[smooth manifolds]]. This is a joint generalization of [[smooth manifolds]] and [[Lie groups]] to [[higher differential geometry]].

Regarded in the more general context of [[smooth groupoids]]/[[smooth stacks]], Lie groupoids present certain well-behaved such objects, often called _[[differentiable stacks]]_.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitDefinition}
###### Definition

A _Lie groupoid_ $X:=X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ is a [[groupoid]] such that both the space of arrows $X_1$ and the space of objects $X_0$ are smooth manifolds, all structure maps are smooth,  and source and target maps $s, t: X_1\rightrightarrows X_0$ are surjective submersions. 

=--

A _Lie groupoid_ $X$ is an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifolds]]. 

Since [[Diff]] does not have all [[pullbacks]], to ensure that this definition makes sense, one needs to ensure that the space $X_1 \times_{s,t} X_1$ of composable [[morphism]]s is an object of [[Diff]]. This is achieved either by adopting the definition of [[internal groupoid]] in the sense of Ehresmann, which includes as data the [[smooth manifold]] of [[composable pairs]], or by taking the conventional route and demanding that the source and target maps $s,t : X_0 \to X_1$ are [[submersion]]s. This ensures the [[pullback]] exists to define said manifold or composable pairs. Therefore a definition used in most modern differential geometry literature is as we see above.

But for most practical purposes, the apparently evident [[2-category]] $Grpd(Diff)$ of such internal groupoids, [[internal functor]]s and internal [[natural transformation]]s is _not_ the correct 2-category to consider. One way to see this is that the [[axiom of choice]] fails in [[Diff]], which means that an internal functor $X \to Y$ of internal groupoids which is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] may nevertheless not be an equivalence, in that it may not have a weak inverse in $Grpd(Diff)$.

See the section [2-Category of Lie groupoids](#2CatOfGrpds) below.

A bit more general than a Lie groupoid is a [[diffeological groupoid]].


### Examples for Lie groupoids

* A Lie group $G$ is a Lie groupoid with $X_1=G$ and $X_0=pt$ a point. Composition of $X$ is provided by the multiplication of $G$.

* A manifold $M$ is a Lie groupoid with $X_1=M$ and $X_0=M$. Source and target maps are identities and we only have identity arrows in this example.

* Given a manifold $M$ and an open cover $\{U_i\}$, we can form a Lie groupoid with $X_1=\sqcup U_i\times_M U_j$ and $X_0=\sqcup U_i$. Then for an element $x_{ij}:=(x_i, x_j)\in U_i\times_M U_j \subset X_1$, $t(x_{ij})=x_i \in U_i$, $s(x_{ij})=x_j \in U_j$, and $x_{ij} \cdot x_{jk}= x_{ik}$. This is sometimes called the **Cech groupoid** or **covering groupoid**.

* Given a Lie group $G$ (right) action  on a manifold $M$, then we may form an associated **action groupoid** (or sometimes called **transformation groupoid**) as follows: $X_1 = M \times G$ and $X_0=M$. For an element $(x, g) \in X_1$, we have $t(x, g) = x$, $s(x, g)=x\cdot g^{-1}$,  and $(x, g)\cdot (y, h) = (x, g\cdot h)$ (we must have $y=x\cdot g^{-1}$ for the multiplication to happen). Action groupoid presents the quotient stack $[M/G]$. Roughly speaking, it is a good replacement for quotient space even if the action is not as nice as you want. 

* Given a manifold $M$, we may also form so-called **pair groupoid**: $X_1= M\times M$ and $X_0=M$. Source and target are projections, and multiplication is given by $(x, y) \cdot (y , z)= (x, z)$. Pair groupoid may be interpreted as the global object of tangent bundle (think why? see the section below on Lie algebroid)

* Given a manifold $M$, we have also an associated **fundamental groupoid** or **homotopy groupoid** $\Pi(M)$: $\Pi(M)_1=\{\text{paths in}\;M\}/{\text homotopies\}$, $\Pi_0(M)=M$. Source and target are end points of a path. Multiplication is concatenation of paths (think why associative?). 

* Given a manifold $M$ with a foliation $F$, we may form various groupoids associated with $F$. 

1. **$F$-pair groupoid**: $X_1:=\{(x, y)| x, y \;\text{are in the same leaf in}\; F \}$, $X_0=M$. Source and target are obvious projections and multiplication is like in the case of pair groupoid. The problem for this groupoid is that it might not be  a Lie groupoid. (why not? for counter example, we refer to [Section 13.5 of Geometric Models for
Noncommutative Algebras](https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanw/Models.pdf) ). 
  
1. **monodromy groupoid $Mon_F(M)$** (it is a foliation version of fundamental groupoid, thus it is also sometimes called $F$-fundamental groupoid): $X_1:=\{$ leaf-wise paths$\}/$ leaf-wise homotopy, $X_0=M$ and the rest is like in the case of fundamental groupoid.

1. **[[holonomy groupoid]] $Hol_F(M)$**: $X_1:=\{$ leaf-wise paths$\}/$ holonomy,
$X_0=M$ and the rest is like in the case of fundamental groupoid. Here, the holonomy of a path $\gamma$ is defined to the germ of diffeomorphisms induced by $\gamma$ between the transversals at the end points.

Among all possible Lie groupoids associated to a foliation, monodromy groupoid is the biggest and holonomy groupoid is the smallest.


### Terminology

Originally Lie groupoids were called (by Ehresmann) _differentiable groupoids_ (and also one considered differentiable _categories_). Sometime in the 1980s there was a change of terminology to _Lie groupoid_ and [[differentiable stack]]s. (reference?)



### Specialisations

One definition which Ehresmann introduced in his paper _Catégories topologiques et catégories différentiables_ (see below) is that of [[locally trivial category|locally trivial groupoid]]. It is defined more generally for topological categories, and extends in an obvious way to topological groupoids, and Lie categories and groupoids. For a topological (resp. Lie) category $X$, let $X_1^{iso}$ denote the subspace (resp. submanifold) of invertible arrows . (This always exists, by general abstract nonsense - I should look up the reference, it's in Bunge-Pare I think - [[David Roberts|DR]])

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition 
A topological groupoid $X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ is **locally trivial** if for every point $p\in X_0$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ and a lift of the inclusion $\{p\} \times U \hookrightarrow X_0 \times X_0$ through $(s,t):X_1^{iso}\to X_0 \times X_0$. 
=--

Clearly for a Lie groupoid $X_1^{iso} = X_1$. It is simple to show from the definition that for a transitive Lie groupoid, $(s,t)$ has local sections. Ehresmann goes on to show a link between smooth [[principal bundles]] and transitive, locally trivial Lie groupoids. See [[locally trivial category]] for details.

### The (2,1)-category of Lie groupoids {#2CatOfGrpds}


As usual for internal categories, the naive 2-category of internal groupoids, [[internal functor]]s and internal [[natural transformation]]s is not quite "correct". One sign of this is that the [[axiom of choice]] fails in [[Diff]] so that an internal functor which is an [[essentially surjective functor]] and a [[full and faithful functor]] may still not have an internal weak inverse.

One way to deal with this is to equip the 2-category with some structure of a [[homotopical category]] and allow morphisms of Lie groupoids to be [[anafunctor]]s, i.e. [[span]]s of internal functors $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} \hat X \to Y$.

Such generalized morphisms -- called _[[Morita morphisms]]_ or _generalized morphisms_ in the literature -- are sometimes modeled as [[bibundle]]s and then called [[Hilsum-Skandalis morphism]]s.

Another equivalent approach is to embed Lie groupoids into the context of [[2-topos]] theory:

The [[2-topos|(2,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(2,1)}(Diff)$ of [[stack]]s/[[2-sheaves]] on [[Diff]] may be understood as a nice [[2-category]] of general groupoids _modeled on_ [[smooth manifold]]s. The degreewise [[Yoneda embedding]] allows to emebed groupoids internal to $Diff$ into stacks on $Diff$. this wider context contains for instance also [[diffeological groupoid]]s.

Regarded inside this wider context, Lie groupoids are identified with [[differentiable stack]]s. The [[(n,r)-category|(2,1)-category]] of Lie groupoids is then the full sub-$(2,1)$-category of $Sh_{(2,1)}(Diff)$ on differentiable stacks.

For more comments on this, see also the beginning of [[∞-Lie groupoid]].

## [[Lie algebroid]]

As the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]] approximation to a [[Lie group]] is a [[Lie algebra]], so the infinitesimal approximation to a Lie groupoid is a [[Lie algebroid]].  


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition 
A Lie algebroid is a vector bundle $A\to M$ together with a vector bundle morphism $\rho: A\to TM$ (called anchor map), and a Lie bracket $[-,-]$ on the space of sections of $A$, satisfying the Leibniz rule

$[X, fY]=f[X,Y]+\rho(X)(f) Y. $ 
=--
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark
You would expect  $\rho$ to preserve $[-,-]$, wouldn't you? It is actually automatic! (reference to Kosmann-Schwartzbach)

Recent progress: it turns out that one may link Lie algebroid with $L_\infty$-spaces (ask Owen Gwilliam for it) 
=--

### Examples of Lie algebroids

* A Lie algebra is a Lie algebroid with base space being a point.

* $0$-bundle over a manifold $M$ is certainly a Lie algebroid in a trivial way.

* [[Action Lie algebroid]]

* Tangent bundle $TM\to M$ is a Lie algebroid with $\rho=id$ and $[-,-]$ the usual Lie bracket for vector fields. See [[tangent Lie algebroid]].

* Given a [[Poisson manifold]] $P$ with Poisson bivector field $\pi$, the cotangent bundle $T^*P$ is equipped with a Lie algebroid structure: $\rho(\xi)=
\pi(\xi)$ and $[\xi_1, \xi_2]=d\pi(\xi_1, \xi_2)$ (or you may have $[df, dg]=d\{ f, g\}$ if you prefer to think in Poisson bracket). See [[Poisson Lie algebroid]].

* [[Atiyah Lie algebroid]]




## Higher Lie groupoids

See

* [[internal ∞-groupoid]]

* [[∞-Lie groupoid]]

## Examples

* Every [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is a 0-[[0-groupoid|truncated]] Lie groupoid.

* For every [[Lie group]] $G$ the one-object [[delooping]] groupoid $\mathbf{B}G$ is a Lie groupoid.

* The Lie group $G$ itself is a 0-[[truncated]] [[group object]] in the 2-category or Lie groupoids.

* Every [[Lie 2-group]] is in particular a Lie groupoid: a [[group object]] in the category of Lie groupoids.

* The [[inner automorphism 2-group]] $\mathbf{E}G = INN(G) = G//G$ is a Lie groupoid. There is an obvious morphism $\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G$.

* For every $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ there is its [[Atiyah Lie groupoid]] $At(P)$.


* The [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ of a smooth manifold is naturally a Lie groupoid.

* The [[path groupoid]] of a smooth manifold is naturally a [[diffeological groupoid]].

* The [[Cech groupoid]] $C(U)$ of a [[cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ of a smooth manifold is a Lie groupoid. 

* Every [[foliation]] gives rise to its [[holonomy groupoid]].

* An [[orbifold]] is a Lie groupoid.

* An [[anafunctor]] $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G$ from a smooth manifold $X$ to $\mathbf{B}G$ is a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] in degree 1 with values in $G$, classifying $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P$.

* The (1-categorical) [[pullback]]

  $$
    \array{
       P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& \mathbf{P} &\to& \mathbf{E}G
       \\
       && \downarrow && \downarrow
       \\
       && C(U) &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
       \\
       && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
       \\
       && X
    }
  $$

  is a Lie groupoid equivalent to this principal bundle $P$.

  (For more on the general phenomenon of which this is a special case see [[principal ∞-bundle]] and [[universal principal ∞-bundle]].)

* Similarly an anafunctor from $P_1(X)$ to $\mathbf{B}G$ is a [[connection on a bundle]] (see there for details).
