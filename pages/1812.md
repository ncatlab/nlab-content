Cosmoses categorize [[universe]]s in set theory. A cosmos is a generalized universe of 1-categories in which you can do category theory. When set theory is generalized to the study of a [[topos]], the analogous generalization of category theory is the study of a cosmos.

Ross Street definition:

A [[bicategory]] such that:
* small bicoproducts exist
* each [[monad (category theory)|monad]] admits a Kleisli construction (analogous to the quotient of an equivalence relation in a topos)
* it is locally small-cocomplete
* there exists a small Cauchy [[generator]].

Cosmoses are closed under dualization, parametrization and localization. Ross Street also introduces elementary cosmoses.

Jean BÃ©nabou definition:

A bicomplete [[symmetric monoidal closed category]].
