_Cosmoses_ (or _cosmoi_) [[categorification|categorify]] [[topos]]es.

A cosmos is a generalized [[universe]] of $1$-categories in which you can do [[category theory]]. When [[set theory]] is generalized to the study of a [[topos]], the analogous generalization of category theory is the study of a cosmos.

Ross Street\'s definition:  A [[bicategory]] such that:
* small ([[2-limit|weak, or bi-]]) [[coproduct]]s exist
* each [[monad]] admits a [[Kleisli construction]] (analogous to the [[quotient object|quotient]] of an [[congruence|internal equivalence relation]] in a topos)
* it is locally small-[[cocomplete category|cocomplete]]
* there exists a small Cauchy [[generator]].

Cosmoses are closed under [[opposite category|dualization]], parametrization and [[localization]]. Ross Street also introduces elementary cosmoses.

Jean BÃ©nabou\'s definition:  A bicomplete [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[closed monoidal category|closed category]].
