## Idea

The _Zariski topology_ is a [[topological space|topology]] on the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring]]. This serves as the basis for much of [[algebraic geometry]].


We consider the definition in increasing generality:

1. [On affine spaces](#OnAffineSpace) $\mathbb{A}^n_k$;

1. [On affine varieties](spring) $Spec(R)$.

###### Definition
**(Zariski topology on affine space)**

Let $k$ be a [[field]], let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and write $k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ for the [[set]] of [[polynomials]] in $n$ [[variables]] over $k$.

For $\mathcal{F} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ a subset of polynomials, let the  subset $V(\mathcal{P}) \subset k^n$ of the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying set of $k$ (the _vanishing set_ of $\mathcal{F}$) be the subset of points on which all these polynomials jointly vanish:

$$
  V(\mathcal{F}) 
    \coloneqq 
  \left\{
     (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in k^n
     \,\vert\,
     \underset{f \in \mathcal{F}}{\forall} f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

These subsets are called the _Zariski [[closed subsets]]_.

Write

$$
  \tau_{\mathbb{A}^n_k}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    k^n \backslash V(\mathcal{F}) \subset k^n
    \,\vert\,
    \mathcal{F} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]
  \right\}
$$

for the set of [[complements]] of subsets the Zariski closed subsets. These are called the _Zariski [[open subsets]]_ of $k^n$.

###### Proposition
**(Zariski topology is well defined)**

Assuming [[excluded middle]], then:

For $k$ a [[field]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the Zariski open subsets of $k^n$ (def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}) form a [[topological space|topology]]. The resulting [[topological space]]

$$
  \mathbb{A}^n_k
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
     k^n, \tau_{\mathbb{A}^n_k}
  \right)
$$

is also called the $n$-dimensional _[[affine space]]_ over $k$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show for $\{\mathcal{F}_i \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]\}_{i \in I}$ a set of subsets of polynomials that

1.  $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} \left(k^n \backslash V(\mathcal{F}_i)\right) = k^n \backslash V(\mathcal{F}_\cup)$ for some $\mathcal{F}_\cup \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$;

1. if $I$ is [[finite set|finite]] then $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} \left( k^n \backslash V(\mathcal{F}_{\cap})\right) = k^n \backslash \mathcal{F}_\cap$ for some $\mathcal{F}_{\cap} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$.

By [[de Morgan's law]] for [[complements]] (and using [[excluded middle]]) this is equivalent to 

1.  $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} V(\mathcal{F}_i) = V(\mathcal{F}_\cup)$ for some $\mathcal{F}_\cup \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$;

1. if $I$ is [[finite set|finite]] then $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} V(\mathcal{F}_i) =  V(\mathcal{F}_{\cap})$ for some $\mathcal{F}_{\cap} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$.

We claim that we may take

1. $\mathcal{F}_\cup = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \mathcal{F}_i$

1. $\mathcal{F}_{\cap} = \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i \coloneqq \left\{ \underset{i \in I}{\prod} f_i \,\vert\, f_i \in \mathcal{F}_i \right\}$.

(In the second line we have the set of all those polynomials which arise as products of polynomials with one factor from each of the $\mathcal{F}_i$.)

Regarding the first point:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in \underset{i \in I}{\cap} V(\mathcal{F}_i)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow\;
     &
     \underset{i \in I}{\forall}
     \left( 
        (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in V(\mathcal{F}_i)
     \right)
     \\
     \Leftrightarrow\;
    &
     \underset{i \in I}{\forall} 
     \left(
       \underset{f \in \mathcal{F}_i}{\forall} 
       \left(
         f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
       \right)
     \right)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow\;
    &
    \underset{f \in \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \mathcal{F}_i}{\forall}
    \left(
       f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
    \right)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow\;
    &
    (a_1, \cdots, a_n)
    \in 
    V\left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \mathcal{F}_i
    \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Regarding the second point, in one direction we have the immediate implication

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & 
    (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in \underset{i \in I}{\cup} V(\mathcal{F}_1)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow\;
    &
    \underset{i \in I}{\exists}
    \left(
      \underset{f \in \mathcal{F}_i}{\forall}
      \left(
        f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
      \right)
    \right)
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;   
    &
    \underset{(f_i) \in \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\prod} f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
    \right)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow\;
    &
    (a_1, \cdots, a_n)
    \in
    V\left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i
    \right) 
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

For the converse direction we need to show that

$$
  \left(
    (a_1 , \cdots , a_n)
    \in
      V\left(
        \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i
      \right) 
   \right)
     \;\Rightarrow\;
   \left(
     (a_1, \cdots, a_n)
     \in 
     \underset{i \in I}{\cup} V(\mathcal{F}_1)   
   \right)
  \,.
$$

hence that 

$$
  \left(
    \underset{(f_i) \in \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i }{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\prod} f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
    \right)
  \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\exists}
    \left(
      \underset{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_i}{\forall}
      \left(
         f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
      \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

By [[excluded middle]], this is equivalent to its [[contraposition]], which by [[de Morgan's law]] is

$$
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_i}{\exists}
      \left(
         f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \neq 0
      \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{(f_i) \in \underset{i \in I}{\prod} \mathcal{F}_i }{\exists}
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\prod} f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \neq 0
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This now is true by the assumption that $k$ is a [[field]]: If all factors $f_i(a_1, \dots a_n) \in k$ are non-zero, then their product $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} f_i(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in k$ is non-zero.

### Properties

#### Topological closures

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $k$ a [[field]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider a [[subset]]

$$
  S \subset k^n
$$

of the underlying set of the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] of $k$ with itself. Then the [[topological closure]] $Cl(S)$ of this subset with respect to the Zariski topology $\tau_{\mathbb{A}^n_k}$ (def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}) is the vanishing set of all those polynomials that vanish on $S$:

$$
  Cl(S)
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    f \in k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]
    \,\vert\,
    \underset{(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in S}{\forall} f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We compute as follows:

$$  
  \begin{aligned}
    Cl(S)
     & \coloneqq
    \underset{ {C \subset k^n \, \text{closed}} \atop {C \supset S} }{\cap}
    C
    \\
    & =
    \underset{
       { \mathcal{F} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n] }
       \atop
       { S \subset V(\mathcal{F}) }
    }{\cap} V(\mathcal{F})
    \\
    & = 
    V\left(
      \underset{
         { \mathcal{F} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n] }
         \atop
         { S \subset V(\mathcal{F}) }
      }{\cup} \mathcal{F}
      \right)
    \\
    & = 
    V \left(
      \left\{
        f \in k[X_1, \cdots, X_2]
        \,\vert\,
        \underset{(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in S}{\forall} f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
      \right\}
    \right)
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Here the first equality is the definition of [[topological closure]], the second is the definition of closed subsets in the Zariski topology (def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}), the third is the expression of intersections of these in terms of unions of polynomials as in the proof of prop. \ref{VerifyingZariskiTopologyOnAffineSpace}, and then the last one is immediate.

=--

#### Irreducible closed subsets as prime ideals

In every [[topological space]] the [[irreducible closed subsets]] play a special role, as being precisely the points in the space as seen in its incarnation as a [[locale]] ([this prop.](irreducible%20closed%20subspace#FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub)). The following shows that in the Zariski topology the irreducible closed subsets all come from [[prime ideals]] in the corresponding [[polynomial ring]], and that when the [[ground field]] is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], then they are in fact in bijection to the prime ideals. See also at _[[schemes are sober]]_.


+-- {: .num_defn #VanishingIdeal}
###### Definition
**([[vanishing ideal]] of Zariski closed subset)**

Let $k$ be a [[field]], and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for $V(\mathcal{F}) \subset k^n$ a Zariski closed subset, according to def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}, hence for $\mathcal{F} \subset k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ a set of polynomials, write

$$
  I(V(\mathcal{F}))
  \subset
  k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]
$$

for the maximal subset of polynomials that still has the same joint vanishing set:

$$
  I(V(\mathcal{F}))
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    f \in k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]
    \,\vert\,
    \underset{(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in V(\mathcal{F})}{\forall} f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
  \right\}
  \;\subset
  \,.
$$

This set is clearly an [[ideal]] in the [[polynomial]] [[ring]]  $k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$, called the _[[vanishing ideal]]_ of $V(\mathcal{F})$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #PrimeVanishingIdealOfIrreducibleZariskiClosed}
###### Proposition

With [[excluded middle]] then:

Let $k$ be a [[field]], let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $V(\mathcal{F}) \subset k^n$ be a Zarsiki closed subset (def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}). Then the following are equivalent:

1. $V(\mathcal{F})$ is an [[irreducible closed subset]];

1. The [[vanishing ideal]] $I(V(\mathcal{F}))$ (def. \ref{VanishingIdeal}) is a [[prime ideal]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $V(\beta)$ is irreducible and consider $f,g \in k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ with $f \cdot g \in I(V(\mathcal{F}))$. We need to show that then alrady $f \in I(V(\mathcal{F}))$ or $g \in I(V(\mathcal{F}))$.

Now since $k$ is a field, we have 

$$
  \left(
    f(a_1, \cdots a_n) \cdot g(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0  
  \right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left(
    \left(
      f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
      \,\text{or}\,
      g(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This implies that 

$$
  V(\mathcal{F}) \subset V(\{f\}) \cup V(\{g\})
$$

and hence that 

$$
  V(\mathcal{F})
   = 
  (V(\mathcal{F}) \cap F(\{f\}))
  \,\,\cup\,\,
  (V(\mathcal{F}) \cap F(\{g\}) ) 
  \,.
$$

But since $V(\{f\})$, $V(\{g\})$ and  $V(\mathcal{F})$ are all closed, by construction, their intersections are closed and hence this is a decomposition of $V(\mathcal{F})$ as a union of closed subsets. Therefore now the assumption that $V(\mathcal{F})$ is [[irreducible closed subset|irreducible]] implies that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &
    \left(
      \,
      V(\mathcal{F}) = V(\mathcal{F}) \cap V(\{f\})
      \,
    \right)
    \,\text{or}\,
    \left(
      \,
      V(\mathcal{F}) = V(\mathcal{F}) \cap V(\{g\})
      \,
    \right)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow \;
    &
    \left(
       \left(
         \,
         V(\mathcal{F}) \subset V(\{f\})
         \,
       \right)
       \,\text{or}\,
       \left(
         \,
         V(\mathcal{F}) \subset V(\{g\})
         \,
       \right)
    \right)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow \,
    &
    \left(
      \left(
        \,
        f \in I(X)
        \,
      \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
      \left(
        \,
        g \in I(X)
        \,
      \right)
    \right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Now for the converse, assume that $I(V(\mathcal{F}))$ is a prime ideal, and that $V(\mathcal{F}) = V(\mathcal{F}_1) \cup V(\mathcal{F}_2)$. We need to show that $V(\mathcal{F})  = V(\mathcal{F}_1)$ or that $V(\mathcal{F}) = V(\mathcal{F}_2)$.

Assume on the contrary, that there existed elements

$$ 
  (a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in V(\mathcal{F}_1) \backslash V(\mathcal{F}_2)
  \;\text{and}\;
  (b_1, \cdots, b_n) \in V(\mathcal{F}_2) \backslash V(\mathcal{F}_1)
  \,
$$

Then in particular the vanishing ideals would not contain each other

$$
  \not\left(
     I(V(\mathcal{F}_1))
     \subset
     I(V(\mathcal{F}_2))
  \right)
  \,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,
  \not\left(
     I(V(\mathcal{F}_2))
     \subset
     I(V(\mathcal{F}_1))
  \right)
$$

and hence there were polynomials 

$$
  f\in I(V(\mathcal{F}_1)) \backslash I(V(\mathcal{F}_2))
  \,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,
  g \in I(V(\mathcal{F}_2)) \backslash I(V(\mathcal{F}_1))
  \,.
$$

But since a product of polynomials vanishes at some point once one of the factors vanishes at that point, it would follows that 

$$
  f \cdot g \in I(V(\mathcal{F}_1)) \cap I(V(\mathcal{F}_2)) = I(V(\mathcal{F}))
  \,,
$$

which were in contradiction to the assumption that $I(V(\mathcal{F}))$ is a prime ideal. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].


=--

Proposition \ref{PrimeVanishingIdealOfIrreducibleZariskiClosed} gives an [[injection]]


$$
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{irreducible Zariski closed}
      \\
      V(\mathcal{F}) \subset k^n
    }
  \right\}
  \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{prime ideals}
      \\
      I \in k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

The following says that for [[algebraically closed fields]] then this is in fact a [[bijection]]:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $k = \overline{k}$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] and  let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then the function

    \\
    V(\mathcal{F})
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    I(V(\mathcal{F}))
  }
$$

from prop. \ref{PrimeVanishingIdealOfIrreducibleZariskiClosed} is a [[bijection]].

The **proof** uses [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ZariskiClosedSubsetsInSpecR}
###### Definition
**(Zariski topology on set of prime ideals)**

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Write $PrimeIdl(R)$ for its set of [[prime ideals]]. For $\mathcal{F} \subset R$ any subset of elements of the ring, consider the subsets of those prime ideals that contain $\mathcal{F}$:

$$
  V(\mathcal{F})
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    p \in PrimeIdl(R) \,\vert\, \mathcal{F} \subset p
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

These are called the _Zariski [[closed subsets]]_ of $PrimeIdl(R)$. Their [[complements]] are called the _Zariski open subsets_. 


=--

+-- {: .num_prop #WellDefinedZariskiTopologyOnSpecR}
###### Proposition
**(Zariski topology well defined)**

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Then the collection of Zariski openn subsets (def. \ref{ZariskiClosedSubsetsInSpecR}) in its set of [[prime ideals]]

$$
  \tau_{Spec(R)} \subset P(PrimeIdl(R))
$$

satisfies the axioms of a [[topological space|topology]], the _Zariski topology_.

This [[topological space]] 

$$
  Spec(R) \coloneqq (PrimeIdl(R), \tau_{Spec(R)})
$$  

is called (the space underlying) the _[[prime spectrum of a commutative ring|prime spectrum of the commutative ring]]_.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $\mathcal{F} \subset R$ write $I(\mathcal{F}) \subset \mathcal{F}$ for the [[ideal]] which is generated by $\mathcal{F}$. Evidently the Zariski closed subsets depend only on this ideal

$$
  V(I(\mathcal{F})) = V(\mathcal{F})
$$
i
and therefore it is sufficient to consider the $V(\mathcal{F})$ for the case that $\mathcal{F} \subset R$  is not just a subset, but an ideal.

So let $\{F_i \in Idl(R)\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of ideals in $R$ and let $\{V(\mathcal{F}_i) \subset PrimeIdl(R)\}_{i \in I}$ be the corresponding set of Zariski closed subsets. We need to show that there exists $\mathcal{F}_\cup, \mathcal{F}_\cap \subset R$ such that

1. $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} V(\mathcal{F}_i) = V(\mathcal{F}_\cup)$;

1. if $I$ is [[finite set]] then $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} V(\mathcal{F}_i) = V(\mathcal{F}_\cap)$.

Regarding the first point:

Write $(\mathcal{F}_i)_{i \in I} \subset R$ for the ideal which is generated by the ideals $\mathcal{F}_i$. We claim that 

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{\cup} = (\mathcal{F}_i)_{i \in I}
  \,.
