##Biography##
**Ali Övgün** was born in 1988 in North Cyprus. He graduated from  Girne 19 Mayıs Türk Maarif Koleji in 2005.

He attended İzmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH), Turkey as an undergraduate, earning a B.Sc. in Physics in 2010
under the advisor of Prof. Dr. Durmuş Ali Demir.  

He spent a year at the  University of Southampton, England, , to gain experience in astroparticle physics via SEPnet Ph.D. Scholarships in 2011. He  then returned to Eastern  Mediterranean University (EMU), North Cyprus, to complete his M.Sc. in 2013 and Ph.D.in Physics in 2016 under the supervisor of Prof. Dr. Mustafa Halilsoy and Prof. Dr. İzzet Sakallı. 

He was thereafter awarded a FONDECYT Postdoctorado 2017- Grant  to continue his research for 3 years at the Instituto de Física, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV), Valparaíso, Chile as a Postdocs researcher.

##Research Areas##
Ali Övgün is a theoretical physicist and works on general relativity, cosmology and astroparticle physics. This is a vast topic which touches upon many different parts of physics from quarks to universe. He is interested in questions that provide us with information about the foundations of physics.
He is studying this relationship further in order to understand the deep connection between black holes and quantum information.  Over the years, He has studied aspects of general relativity related to black holes, wormholes, compact stars, quasi-normal modes, black hole's thermodynamics, Hawking radiation, cosmology, inflation, gravitational lensing, complexity, modified gravity theories, AdS/CFT, and holography. 

 He try to address a number of interesting questions in physics, such as:
-Is it possible that the Big Bang could be replaced with a wormhole at the beginning of time?
-Is it possible to create a traversable wormhole?
-How can quantum effects be included in black hole/wormhole thermodynamics?
-What happens at the edge of a Black Hole or inside a Black hole?
-Could Our Universe Be A Hologram? or How Many Dimensions In The Holographic Universe?
-Why is the universe expanding at an accelerating rate?
-How are Brain Cells Like Little Universes? so on...
