## Idea

The standard [[model (in theoretical physics)]] for the [[observable universe]] on the largest length scales of [[cosmology]]:

it is an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] [[FRW spacetime]] with [[cosmological constant]] ("[[dark energy]]") and cold [[dark matter]]. The technical term for this is the _$\Lambda$ CDM concordance model_ (where "$\Lambda$" is the standard symbol for the [[cosmological constant]] and "CDM" is for "cold dark matter"). 



The current model assumes that the energy density of the [[observable universe]] consists of

* 4.9% [[baryon|baryonic]] (visible) [[matter]]

* 26.8% [[dark matter]]

* 68.3% [[dark energy]].
