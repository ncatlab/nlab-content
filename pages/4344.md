###### Definition
A $C^*$-category is a $*$-[[star-category|category]] that has a norm on each [[hom-set|set of arrows]] $Hom(x, y)$ that turns it into a [[Banach space]] with ${\|s^* s\|} = {\|s\|}^2$ for $s \in Hom(x, y)$ and ${\|{s t}\|} \leq {\|s\|} {\|t\|}$ for all arrows $s, t$ that are composable, that is $s \in Hom(x, y)$ and $t \in Hom(y, x)$.

Note that a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] is precisely a one-object $C^*$-category.  Accordingly, a more systematic name for a $C^*$-category is a __$C^*$-algebroid__.
