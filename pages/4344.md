###### Definition
A $C^*-$category is a [[star-category]] that has a norm on each set of arrows $Hom(x, y)$ that turns it into a Banach space with $s^* s = |s|^2$ for $s \in Hom(x, y)$ and $|st| \leq |s| |t|$ for all arrows $s, t$ that are composable, that is $s \in Hom(x, y)$ and $t \in Hom(y, x)$.
