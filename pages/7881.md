# The Continuum Hypothesis

## Idea

> Cantor's continuum problem is simply the question: How many points are there on a straight line in Euclidean space? In other terms, the question is: How many different sets of integers do there exist?  K. Gödel ([1947](#Goedel47), p.515)

The **continuum hypothesis** is a famous problem of [[set theory]] concerning the cardinality of the [[real numbers]] (the "[[continuum]]"). The hypothesis in its classical form goes back to [[Georg Cantor|G. Cantor]] and was on top of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's millenium list]] of open problems in mathematics in 1900.

In concise form the continuum hypothesis ($CH$) reads: $\quad 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph _1\quad$; which roughly says that every [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] is either [[countable set|countable]] or has the same [[cardinality]] as the set of all real numbers.

The *generalized continuum hypothesis* ($GCH$) states more generally: $\quad 2^{\aleph_k}=\aleph _{k+1}\quad$. (But see also Remark \ref{GCHinZF} below.) 

The **independence of the continuum hypothesis** from the [[ZFC]] axioms of set theory has been established in landmark papers by [[Kurt Gödel|K. Gödel]] and [[Paul J. Cohen|P. J. Cohen]], the former proving the consistency of $ZFC+CH$ relative to $ZFC$ in 1938, and the latter proving the consistency of $ZFC+\neg CH$ relative to $ZFC$ in 1963.

The broader implications of the independence results for set theory in general and $ZFC$ in particular are somewhat controversial. They are widely taken as a pointer towards the deficiency of $ZFC$ and the need for _new axioms_ of set theory. This position has been voiced famously in [Gödel (1947)](#Goedel47) from a [[platonism|platonist perspective]].

[[William Lawvere|W. Lawvere]] in 2003 interpreted Cantor's original point of view as saying that $CH$ holds for 'sufficiently structureless' sets and, accordingly, viewed Gödel's 1938 result as a proof of $CH$, whereas in [[Patrick Dehornoy|P. Dehornoy]]'s 2003 reinterpretation based on work of _Woodin_, $CH$ is actually conjectured to be false. [[Solomon Feferman|S. Feferman]] has argued more recently that $CH$ is essentially _mathematically indefinite_ and has made notions of 'indefiniteness' explicit that indeed enable to back this point of view with technical results (cf. [Feferman (2011)](#Feferman11)).

The attempt to give categorical accounts of the [[forcing]] methods introduced by Cohen provided a strong impetus in the development of (elementary) [[topos theory]] in the work of [[Peter Freyd|Freyd]], [[Miles Tierney|Tierney]], Lawvere and later Scedrov. The following exposition follows this categorical  approach.


## Statement

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $E$ be an [[elementary topos]] with [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ and [[natural numbers object]] $N$.  The (external) **continuum hypothesis** in $E$ asserts that if there is a sequence of [[monomorphisms]]

$$N \hookrightarrow B\hookrightarrow \Omega^N$$

then either the first or the second is an [[isomorphism]].

In the classical case (that is, in the topos [[Set]] with the [[axiom of choice]]), this equivalently asserts that there is no strict inequality of [[cardinal numbers]]

$${|\mathbb{N}|} \lt \alpha\lt {|\Omega^\mathbb{N}|}$$

which it is more common to write as

$$ \aleph_0 \lt \alpha \lt 2^{\aleph_0} $$

## Unprovability

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There exists a [[boolean topos]] in which the [[axiom of choice]] holds and the continuum hypothesis fails.

=--

One topos for which the theorem holds is called the *Cohen topos*; it is the topos of sheaves with respect to the [[dense topology]] (also called the $\neg\neg$-topology) on the Cohen [[poset]].  Thus, in this topos, there exist monomorphisms $\mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow B\hookrightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ that are both not isomorphisms.

The Cohen topos will be constructed from the topos [[Set]] of sets.  For this, recall that the subobject classifier of $Set$ is $2\coloneqq \{0,1\}$. The technique of constructing such a topos is called [[forcing]].
 
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(Cohen poset)**

Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers; i.e. the natural-numbers object in $Set$. Let $B$ be a set with strictly larger cardinality ${|B|}\gt {|\mathbb{N}|}$; e.g. $B\coloneqq 2^{2^{\mathbb{N}}}$ will do because of the [[diagonal argument]].  Then the *Cohen poset* $P$ is defined to be the set of morphisms

$$p:F_p\to 2$$

where $F_p\subseteq B\times \mathbb{N}$ is any [[finite set|finite]] subset.
The order relation on $P$ is defined by

$$q\le p\; iff\; F_q\supseteq F_p\;and\;q|_{F_p}=p$$

where the right-hand condition means that $q$ restricted to $F_p$ must coincide with $p$.
=--

We think of each element of $P$ as an approximation to the function $F:B\times\mathbb{N}$ that is the [[exponential|transpose]] of the putative monomorphism

$$f:B\to 2^\mathbb{N}$$

with "smaller" elements considered as better approximations. The very rough intuition is that $p\to q\to \dots$ (if $p\ge p\ge \dots$) forms a [[codirected diagram]] of monomorphisms with domains of increasing size whose colimit is $f$, and that by [[free cocompletion]] (i.e. forming (pre)sheaves) we obtain a topos in which this colimit exists.


+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma
The [[dense topology|dense]] [[Grothendieck topology]] on $P$ is [[subcanonical topology|subcanonical]].  In other words: For any $p\in P$ we have $y(p)=hom(-,p)\in\Sh(p,\neg\neg)$ 
=--

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma
Let $k_{B\times\mathbb{N}}:\begin{cases}P\to Set \\ p \mapsto B\times\mathbb{N}\end{cases}$ denote the functor constant on $B\times\mathbb{N}$. Let

$$A:\begin{cases}
P\to Set
\\
p\mapsto \{(b,n)|p(b,n)=0\}\subseteq B\times \mathbb{N}
\end{cases}$$

Then we have $\neg\neg A=A$ in $Sub(k_{B\times\mathbb{N}})$; i.e. $A$ is a closed subobject with respect to the dense topology $\neg\neg$ in the [[algebra of subobjects]] of $k_{B\times\mathbb{N}}$.
=--

Let $\Omega$ denote the [[subobject classifier]] of $Psh(P)$. Let $\Omega_{\neg\neg}$ denote the subobject classifier of $Sh(P,\neg\neg)$. Recall that $\Omega_{\neg\neg}$ is given by the equalizer $\Omega_{\neg\neg}=eq(id_\Omega,\neg\neg)$.

By the preceding lemma, the [[characteristic morphism]] $\chi_a$ of the subobject $a \colon A\hookrightarrow k_{B\times\mathbb{N}}=k_B\times\k_\mathbb{N}$ factors through some $f \colon k_{B\times\mathbb{N}}\to \Omega_{\neg\neg}$.

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma 
The adjoint $g:k_B\to \Omega_{\neg\neg}^{k_{\mathbb{N}}}$ of $f$ is a monomorphism.
=--

+-- {: .num_corollary}
###### Corollary
The associated-sheaf functor sends $g$ to a monomorphism in the Cohen topos.
=--

## Unrefutability

If $V$ is a model of [[ZF]], then the continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] both hold in Gödel's [[constructible universe]] $L$ built from $V$. 

+-- {: .num_remark #GCHinZF} 
###### Remark 
Regarding the statement of the *generalized* continuum hypothesis in *ZF* (not ZFC), one should distinguish various possibilities. One could, on the one hand, leave the statement $2^{\alpha_n} = \alpha_{n+1}$ unchanged, so that the GCH becomes a statement just about ordinals or well-ordered sets. On the other hand, one could then argue that this would mean the generalized continuum hypothesis is not as general or strong as it might be, since not all sets can be well-ordered using ZF alone. The more general statement would say that if there are monomorphisms $X \to Y$ and $Y \to P(X)$, then $Y$ is bijective with one of $X, P(X)$. 

For example, there is a famous result that over ZF, the generalized continuum hypothesis implies AC. (See [[Hartogs number]].) For this result, one certainly needs to use the stronger formulation. 
=-- 

## Generalization: Easton's theorem 

Just how flexible can the power operation $\kappa \mapsto 2^\kappa$ be? There are of course some constraints. Obvious ones are that $\kappa \lt 2^\kappa$ and $2^\kappa \leq 2^\lambda$ whenever $\kappa \leq \lambda$. A more refined one is a consequence of [[König’s theorem]], namely that 

* $\kappa \lt cof(2^\kappa)$ 

where the right side is the [[cofinality]] of $2^\kappa$. 

A remarkable illustration of the power of the forcing method is Easton's theorem, which says that as far as [[regular cardinals]] go, these are really the *only* constraints. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
**(Easton)** 
Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a model of ZFC in which the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) holds. Let $F$ be a partial function from the class of infinite regular cardinals to the class of cardinals such that 

* $F$ preserves the order $\leq$; 

* $\kappa$ is less than the cofinality of $F(\kappa)$ for all $\kappa \in dom(F)$. 

Then there is a generic extension $\mathcal{M}[G]$ of $\mathcal{M}$ with the same cardinals and cofinalities, such that $\mathcal{M}[G] \models 2^\kappa = F(\kappa)$ for all $\kappa \in dom(F)$. 
=-- 

On the other hand, the behavior of the power operation on [[regular cardinal|singular cardinals]] is not so unconstrained. For example, in a model of ZFC, the smallest cardinal for which GCH fails can never be singular. The so-called "[[pcf theory]]" (or "possible cofinalities theory"), due to [[Saharon Shelah]], gives some information on possible bounds for the power operation on singular cardinals (among other things).
