## Idea

A [[duality in string theory]]:

F-theory on an [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[K3]] is supposed to be equivalent to [[heterotic string theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on a 2-[[torus]]. An early argument for this is due to ([Sen 96](#Sen96)).

More generally, heterotic string theory on an eliptically fibered Calabi-Yau $Z \to B$ of complex dimension $(n-1)$ is supposed to be equivalent $F$-theory on an $n$-dimensional $X\to B$ with elliptic K3-fibers.

A detailed discussion of the [[equivalence]] of the respective [[moduli spaces]] is originally due to ([Friedman-Morgan-Witten 97](#FriedmanMorganWitten97)). A review of this is in ([Donagi 98](#Donagi98)).

> The [[heterotic string theory|heterotic string]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $(n-1)$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $Z \to B$ is conjectured to be [[duality in string theory|dual]] to [[F-theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $n$-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $X \to B$, fibered over the same base with [[elliptic fibration|elliptic]] [[K3]] fibers. In particular, the [[moduli]] of the two theories should be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. The cases most relevant to the physics are $n=2$, $3$, $4$, i.e. the [[KK-compactification|compactification]] is to [[dimensions]] $d=8$, $6$ or $4$ respectively. Mathematically, the richest picture seems to emerge for $n=3$, where the [[moduli space]] involves an analytically [[integrable system]] whose fibers admit rather different descriptions in the two theories.

## Aspects

### Non-reducible heterotic $E_8$-gauge backgrounds
 {#NonReducibleHeteroticGaugeBackgrounds}

There are some [[F-theory]] backgrounds whose supposed dual in [[heterotic string theory]] involves an [[E8]]-principal connection which is not reducible to $Spin(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ ([Distler-Sharpe 10, section 5](#DistlerSharpe10)), while in fact the traditional construction of the heterotic [[worldsheet]] theory only covers this case. In ([Distler-Sharpe 10, section 7-8](#DistlerSharpe10)) it is argued that therefore a more general formulation of [[heterotic string theory]] needs to involve [[parameterized WZW models]]. See also at _[heterotic string -- Properties -- General gauge backgrounds and parameterized WZW models](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/heterotic+string+theory#GeneralGaugeBackgroundsAndParameterizedWZWModels)_.
