## Idea ##

A _derived elliptic curve_ is an object in [[higher geometry]] that is to an [[E-∞ ring]] as an ordinary [[elliptic curve]] is to an ordinary [[ring]].

## Definition ##

For the notation and terminology of the following definition, see (for the time being)


Let $A$ be an [[E-∞ ring]]. A **derived elliptic curve** over $A$ is [[derived group scheme]] $E \to Spec A$ with the property that the underlying morphism $\bar E \to Spec \pi_0 A$ is an ordinary [[elliptic curve]].

This is definition 4.1 in
