## Idea

A *hypergraph category* is a [[monoidal category]] whose [[string diagrams]] are [[hypergraphs]].  Recall that in general the vertices of a string diagram correspond to morphisms in a category, and its edges to objects.  An ordinary string diagram is a [[quiver]], where the inputs and outputs of a vertex describe objects appearing in a tensor-product decomposition of the domain and codomain of a morphism; each edge is connected to only one vertex as input and one vertex as output because of how morphisms in a category are composed.  A hypergraph category allows edges to connect to many vertices as input and many vertices as output, which categorically means that we can compose many morphisms containing an object in their codomain with many morphisms containing that object in their domain.

Hypergraph categories have been reinvented many times and given many different names, such as "well-supported compact closed categories" ([Carboni](#Carboni) and [RSW](#RSW)), "dgs-monoidal categories" ([GH](#GH)), and "spidered/dungeon categories" ([Morton](#Morton)).  The name "hypergraph category" is more recent ([Kissinger](#Kissinger) and [Fong](#FongDC)).

## Definition

A **hypergraph category** is:

* a [[symmetric monoidal category]] in which
* each object is equipped with the structure of a special commutative [[Frobenius algebra]], such that
* the Frobenius algebra structure of any tensor product $X\otimes Y$ is induced in the canonical way from those of $X$ and $Y$.

Note in particular that we do *not* require the morphisms of the category to be Frobenius algebra morphisms.

## Examples

* The category [[Rel]] of sets and relations (with cartesian product of sets as the monoidal product) is a hypergraph category, with the Frobenius algebra on $X$ given by the "deleting and copying" [[comonoid]] $\{ (x, *) \mid x \in X \}$, $\{ (x, (x, x)) | x \in X \}$ together with its [[opposite relation|opposite]].

* More generally, categories of [[span|spans]], [[cospan|cospans]], [[relation|relations]] and [[corelation|corelations]] in any category (with the appropriate structure) are hypergraph categories.

* Categories of [[decorated cospan|decorated cospans]] and decorated corelations are hypergraph categories.

## Remarks

* The reason for the definition is that if $X$ is a special commutative Frobenius algebra, then there is a unique morphism $X^{\otimes m}\to X^{\otimes n} $ induced by the Frobenius algebra structure.  It can of course be defined as the $m$-ary multiplication followed by the $n$-ary comultiplication; the real point is that the special commutative Frobenius axioms ensure that any composite of two such morphisms is again another such morphism.  This is what enables the hypergraph string diagrams described informally above. (Some authors refer to these morphisms as "spiders" due to their appearance in [[string diagram|string diagrams]], as a black node with $m + n$ legs.)

* The free hypergraph category on one object is the category of finite sets and isomorphism classes of cospans.  This is a decategorification of the fact that the free monoidal category containing a (non-special) commutative Frobenius algebra is the category of 1-dimensional [[manifolds]] and isomorphism classes of 2-dimensional [[cobordisms]].  More general free hypergraph categories can be constructed using labeled cospans.

* Note that the special commutative Frobenius algebras are not required to be "extra-special", meaning that the morphism $I = X^{\otimes 0} \to X^{\otimes 0} = I$ need not be the identity.  Thus, the relevant sort of "hypergraphs" can contain "edges not incident to any vertices".  If we add the extra-special condition, the cospans are replaced by "co-relations", i.e. jointly surjective cospans.

## Hypergraph categories as monoids in a presheaf category
Let $\mathbf{Cospan}_\Delta$ be the free hypergraph category on generators $\Delta$. The objects are lists of elements of $\Delta$, or equivalently pairs $(m,l)$ of a natural number $m$ and a labelling $l\colon m\to \Delta$. The morphisms are compatible cospans of functions (up to iso).

###### Theorem 
[Fong, Spivak](#FongSpivak).
To give a hypergraph category with chosen objects $\Delta$ that generate it is to give a lax monoidal functor $\mathbf{Cospan}_\Delta\to \mathbf{Set}$. 
=--
(Formally, this can be made into an equivalence between the category of objectwise-free hypergraph categories and the lax monoidal functors; and every hypergraph category is in some sense equivalent to an objectwise-free one.)

A hypergraph category is thus a [presheaf](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/presheaf) $H\colon \mathbf{Cospan}_\Delta\to \mathbf{Set}$ that has lax monoidal structure 
\[
1\to H()\qquad H(\vec a)\times H(\vec b)\to H(\vec a,\vec b)
\]
which is strongly reminiscent of the [mix rule](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mix%20rule). 
A lax monoidal functor is the same thing as a [monoid for the Day convolution](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Day+convolution#Monoids). Thus hypergraph categories are monoids in the presheaf category $[\mathbf{Cospan}_\Delta, \mathbf{Set}]$.
