Given [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$, the _functor category_ $D^C$ has [[functor|functors]] $F: C \to D$ as [[object|objects]] and [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between these as [[morphism|morphisms]].

Functor categories serve as the [[hom-category|hom-categories]] in the [[strict 2-category]] [[Cat]].

In the context of [[enriched category theory]] the functor category is generalized to the [[enriched functor category]].

In the absence of the [[axiom of choice]] (including many [[internal category|internal]] situations), the appropriate notion to use is the [[anafunctor category]].
