__$Heyt Alg$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[Heyting algebras]] and whose [[morphisms]] are Heyting algebra [[homomorphisms]], that is [[lattice]] homomorphisms which also preserve the [[Heyting implication]].  $Heyt Alg$ is a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]].

$Hety Alg$ is given by a finitary [[variety of algebras]], or equivalently by a [[Lawvere theory]], so it has all the usual properties of such categories.  By general abstract nonsense, the __[[free object|free]] Heyting algebra__ on a [[set]] $X$ exists, but it is not easy to describe in general.

*  The free Heyting algebra on the [[empty set]] is the [[Boolean domain]] $\{\bot, \top\}$.
*  The free Heyting algebra on a [[singleton]] $\{x\}$ is [[infinite set|infinite]], although it has a nice picture.
