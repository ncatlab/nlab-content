Throughout, we will use the notation and terminology of Ch. VII of [CWM](#CWM), with the exception that the product bifunctor of a 
monoidal category will be denoted by $\otimes$, instead of Mac Lane's
$\square$ notation.

## Introduction and statement ##

Let $\langle B, \otimes_B, \alpha^{(B)}, e_B, \lambda^{(B)}, \varrho^{(B)}, \rangle$ be some [[monoidal category]].  At first, we would like the _[[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]]_ to state that
_every_ [[diagram]] in $B$ built up from instances of $\alpha$,
$\lambda^{(B)}$, $\varrho^{(B)}$ and identity arrows by multiplications
$\otimes_B$ (such as the pentagon diagram) commutes. This, however, is not possible, because some formally different vertices of such a diagram
might turn out to be the same in our particular
monoidal category $B$, in a way that makes the diagram
non-commutative.   

As a concrete example of the problem in a particular
monoidal category, consider Isbell's famous example for showing that
moving to skeleta does not assure that all monoidal categories are
strict (see p. 164 of [CWM](#CWM)). In this example, one shows that if
$D$ is the denumerable set in a skeleton $\mathbf{Set}_0$ of $\mathbf{Set}$, then,
although $D\times(D\times D)$ equals $(D\times D)\times D$, the
associator $\alpha_{D,D,D}$ (defined as usual to commute with the
projections) cannot be the identity.

So, in order for coherence to work, we must change it to the statement
that every ''formal'' diagram commutes.  
The formal diagrams that commute will be described through certain
graphs $\mathcal{G}'_n$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}$).  The vertices of
$\mathcal{G}'_n$ will be _binary words_ of _length_ $n$, and its
arrows will represent the sort of arrows that participate in the
coherence theorem.

We begin by defining the set $W$ of binary words inductively, as the
set of all terms in one variable (denoted by ''$-$'') in the signature
$\{e_0, \otimes\}$, where $e_0$ is an 0-ary function symbol (a
constant), and $\otimes$ is a binary function symbol.  So, $W$ is the
smallest set of strings in the alphabet
$\{e_0,\otimes,-\}$ satisfying  $-\in W$, $e_0\in W$, and if $u,v\in
W$ then $\otimes u v$ (usually written as $(u) \otimes (v)$ or even
$u\otimes v$ for convenience) is also in $W$. 

Next, we define a set $S'$ of certain arrow symbols as
follows (the reason for the tag in $S'$ will be clear later).
Let $S'$ be the smallest set of strings in the alphabet
$W\cup\{1,\alpha,\alpha^{-1},\lambda,\lambda^{-1},\varrho,\varrho^{-1},\displaystyle{\hat{\otimes}\}}$
satisfying $\alpha u v w, \alpha^{-1} u v w\in S'$ for all
$u,v,w\in W$, $\lambda w, \lambda^{-1} w, \varrho w,
\varrho^{-1} w \in S'$ for all $w\in W$, and for all $w\in W$, if
$\beta\in S'$ then also $(\beta)\hat{\otimes} (1w), (1w)\hat{\otimes} (\beta)\in
S'$ (more precisely, the last terms should be called,
$\hat{\otimes} \beta 1 w$ and $\hat{\otimes} 1 w \beta$, but as before, we will
usually use the more convenient infix notation). Note that
elements of $S'$ are comprised of a single associator/unitor symbol
(or their inverses) tensored with one or more strings of the form
$1w$.  Later, when we will 
interpret the elements of $S'$ 
as arrows of a particular monoidal category $B$, we will call them _basic arrows_. 
The idea is that every arrow of the ''right'' kind in
$B$ (the kind considered in the coherence theorem) factors as the
composition of such basic arrows (because $\otimes$ is a bifunctor).

It can be verified that every string of
$S'$ is of one and only one of the following forms:
$\alpha u v w$ for some $u, v, w\in W$, $\alpha^{-1} u v w$ for
some $u, v, w\in W$, $\lambda w$ for some 
$w\in W$, ..., $\beta \hat{\otimes} 1w$ for some $w\in W$ and
$\beta \in S'$. Also, in each case the ''arguments'' are determined uniquely
(for example, both $\beta$ and $w$ are determined from $\beta \hat{\otimes}
1w$), and so we may define functions on $S'$ inductively.

Let $\mathcal{G}'$ be the directed graph (quiver in $n$Lab jargon)
with $W$ as the set of objects, $S'$ as the set of arrows, and with
the obviously defined $dom$ and $cod$ (for example, For $u,v,w \in
W$, $dom(\alpha u v w) := u\otimes (v\otimes w) =:cod(\alpha^{-1}
u v w)$, $dom(\beta \hat{\otimes} 1w) := dom(\beta)\otimes w$, etc.

Define inductively the length $len(w)$ of a binary
word $w$ as follows: 

$$
len(e_0):=0,\quad len(-):=1,\quad len(u\otimes v):= len(u) + len(v).
$$

Since for all $s\in S'$, $len(dom(s))=len(cod(s))$ (this can be
verified by induction), $\mathcal{G}'$ is the 
union of disjoint graphs $\mathcal{G}'_n$, where for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, the
vertices of $\mathcal{G}'_n$ are the binary words of length $n$, and the
edges are all $s\in S'$ with $len(dom(s)) = n$.

Now, let us fix some monoidal category $\langle B, \otimes_B, \alpha^{(B)}, e_B, \lambda^{(B)}, \varrho^{(B)}, \rangle$, and some object
$b\in obj(B)$.  We can interpret vertices and edges of $\mathcal{G}'$
in $B$ by defining inductively functions $(\cdot)_b: W\to obj(B)$,
$\mathcal{I}:S'\to arr(B)$ 
as follows: 

$$
(e_0)_b:=e_B,\text{ } (-)_b:=b, (u\otimes v)_b:= u_b\otimes_B v_b,
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&&\mathcal{I}(\alpha u v w) := \alpha^{(B)}_{u_b,v_b,w_b},\quad \mathcal{I}(\alpha^{-1}
u v w):= (\alpha^{(B)}_{u_b,v_b,w_b})^{-1},\\
&& \mathcal{I}(\lambda u) := \lambda^{(B)}_{u_b}, \quad \mathcal{I}(\lambda^{-1} u) :=
(\lambda^{(B)}_{u_b})^{-1},\\
&& \mathcal{I}(\varrho u) := \varrho^{(B)}_{u_b}, \quad \mathcal{I}(\varrho^{-1} u) :=
(\varrho^{(B)}_{u_b})^{-1},\\
&& \mathcal{I}(\beta\hat{\otimes} 1w) := \mathcal{I}(\beta)\otimes_B 1_{w_b},\quad
\mathcal{I}(1w\hat{\otimes} \beta) := 1_{w_b}\otimes_B\mathcal{I}(\beta)
\end{aligned}
$$

(for $u,v,w\in W$ and $\beta\in S'$).

It is straightforward to verify that the pair $\langle (\cdot)_b,\mathcal{I}\rangle$
is a morphism of graphs $\mathcal{G}'\to U B$ (where $UB$ is the
underlying graph of $B$), that is, that for all $s\in S'$, we have 

$$
(dom(s))_b = dom_B(\mathcal{I}(s)),\quad (cod(s))_b = cod_B(\mathcal{I}(s)).
$$

Therefore, if $s_1,\ldots,s_m$ form a path in $\mathcal{G}'$ (i.e.,
$dom(s_{i+1})=cod(s_i)$ for all $i$),
then $\mathcal{I}(s_1),\ldots,\mathcal{I}(s_m)$ (in that order) are composable
arrows in $B$.  We can finally state the coherence theorem:

+-- {: .num_theorem #CohA}
###### Theorem
**(Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem, version 1)**. Let $v,w\in W$ be two binary words of the same length $n$.  Suppose
that $s_1,\ldots,s_m$ and $s'_1,\ldots s'_{m'}$ form two paths from $v$
to $w$ in $\mathcal{G}'_n$.  Then the two corresponding sequences of
arrows in $B$ have the same composition in $B$: 

$$
\mathcal{I}(s_m)\circ \cdots\circ \mathcal{I}(s_1) = \mathcal{I}(s'_{m'})\circ
\cdots\circ \mathcal{I}(s'_1) 
$$
=--

Note that at a first glance, this ''single variable coherence'' looks
quite limited:  We only prove commutativity of diagrams in $B$ whose
vertices are obtained by tensoring a single element $b$ (e.g.,
vertices such as $b\otimes_B ((b\otimes_B b)\otimes_B b)$).  However, it
turns out that the general case follows almost immediately from this
case.  The trick is to construct an appropriate monoidal category
$It(B)$ in a way that the coherence in one variable for $It(B)$ and
one special object of $It(B)$ is the general coherence for $B$.

The coherence theorem  in [CWM](#CWM) (Theorem VII.2.1) is stated in a
different way, but the main bulk of its proof is actually devoted to
prove the above coherence theorem. To state also the version of Theorem
VII.2.1 of [CWM](#CWM), let $\mathcal{W}$ be the category whose objects are
binary words, with a single arrow $u\to v$ between any two binary
words of the same length and with the obvious composition.  The
monoidal structure on $\mathcal{W}$ is the obvious one: The unit is $e_0$, and
the components of the associator and the unitors are each the
appropriate single arrow of the relevant hom-set.  The coherence
theorem in [CWM](#CWM) is as follows:

+-- {: .num_theorem #CohB}
###### Theorem
**(Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem, version 2)**. For any monoidal category $B$ and any object $b$ of $B$, there is a
unique strict morphism of monoidal categories $\mathcal{W}\to B$ with $
(-)\mapsto b$.
 =--

Version 2 says that $\mathcal{W}$ is the free monoidal category on one
generator $(-)$ (that is, that it is the object part of a universal
arrow from $(-)$ to the forgetful (object) functor $\mathbf{Moncat}_s \to \mathbf{Set}$, where
$\mathbf{Moncat}_s$ stands for monoidal categories with strict morphisms of
monoidal categories) . As we shall see later, this version follows
almost immediately  from version 1.  While this is not clear at a
first glance, it is also 
true that version 1 follows from version 2. For this, we will define a
monoidal category $F[1]$ that will be almost evidently free (and
hence, given version 2, isomorphic to $\mathcal{W}$).


## Coherence only for the associator ##

It will be simpler to first prove coherence only for the
associator, forgetting about the unit and the unitors. 
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the full subgraph of $\mathcal{G}'$ whose vertex set
consists only of those binary words that do not involve $e_0$.  We
will write $W_0$ for the subset of $W$ consisting of such binary
words (that is, for the vertex set of $\mathcal{G}$). 

Let $S$ be the subset of $S'$ consisting of the strings that  
involve only instances of $\alpha$ and $\alpha^{-1}$ (but not
$\lambda$, $\lambda^{-1}$, $\varrho$, and $\varrho^{-1}$) and also do _not_ involve $e_0$ 
(e.g., as in $\alpha e_0 v w$).  Actually, $S$
could be defined inductively, similarly to $S'$, omitting the reference
to $\lambda$, $\lambda^{-1}$, $\varrho$, and $\varrho^{-1}$, and using $W_0$
instead of $W$.  Note that $S$ is the set of arrows of $\mathcal{G}$:
$S=\{s\in S'|dom(s),cod(s)\in W_0\}$. For simplicity, we will use
the same names $dom,cod$ for the restriction of $dom, cod$ to
$S$.    

Let $\mathcal{G}_n$ be the full subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$ on the vertices
of length $n$. The proof will use a certain vertex $w^{(n)}$ of $\mathcal{G}_n$ as
a''pivot.''  Specifically, we let $w^{(n)}\in W_0$ be the unique word of
length $n$ in which all pairs of parentheses start in front (e.g.,
$(-\otimes -)\otimes -$ for $n=3$, $((-\otimes -)\otimes -)\otimes -$
for $n=4$, and $(((-\otimes-)\otimes - )\otimes -)\otimes -$ for
$n=5$; a precise inductive definition is $w^{(1)}=-$, $w^{(n)}=
w^{(n-1)}\otimes -$ for $n\geq 1$).  

The proof will also use a measure $\rho$ of how ''far'' is a word
$w\in W_0$ from being $w^{(n)}$. So, we define $\rho$ inductively by

$$
\rho(-) = 0, \quad \rho(v\otimes w) = \rho(v)+\rho(w)+len(w)-1.
$$

It is easily verified that $\rho(u)\geq 0$ for all $u\in W_0$, with
equality iff $u = w^{(n)}$.  In fact,  $\rho(u)$ is the
length of the longest directed path (see ahead for what ''directed''
means here) from $u$ to $w^{(n)}$. [Intuitively, the idea is
that if $u=v\otimes w$, then we may first handle $v$, then handle $w$, in
order to reach $w^{(n_1)}\otimes w^{(n_2)}$ (with $n_1:=len(v)$ and
$n_2:=len(w)$) but not yet to $w^{(n)}$. Then, by $n_2-1$ additional
applications of associators, we finally reach $w^{(n)}$.]

We will call any $s\in S$ that involves $\alpha$ a _directed arrow_, and any $s\in S$ 
that involves $\alpha^{-1}$ an _anti-directed arrow_.  A more precise inductive definition is this:
For all $u,v,w\in W_0$, $\alpha u v w$ is directed, and if $\beta$ is
directed, then $\beta\hat{\otimes} 1 w$ and $1 w\hat{\otimes} \beta$ are
directed for all $w\in W_0$. The definition of anti-directed is
obtained by replacing $\alpha$ by $\alpha^{-1}$ and ''directed'' by
''anti-directed'' in the previous definition. It can be shown by
induction that if $s\in S$ is directed, then $\rho(cod(s))$ is
strictly smaller that $\rho(dom(s))$.

For future reference, define the ''formal inverse'' of $s'\in S'$ in the
obvious inductive way, by setting, for example,  $inv(\alpha uvw): =
\alpha^{-1}_{u,v,w}$, $inv(\alpha^{-1} uvw):=
\alpha uvw$ $inv(\beta\hat{\otimes} 1w):=
inv(\beta) \hat{\otimes} 1w$, etc.  It can be verified that the formal
inverse has all expected properties (such as being idempotent,
switching domain and codomain, taking an anti-directed arrow to a
directed one, and being interpreted as the inverse of the 
interpretation of the original arrow). 

From each $w\in W_0$ of length $n$, there is a
''canonical'' path, involving only directed arrows, from
$w$ to $w^{(n)}$ in $\mathcal{G}_n$, obtained by
successively moving the outermost parentheses to the left with the appropriate 
$\alpha$.  For an example, consider the
paths $\to\to$ and $\to\uparrow$ in the pentagon (5) on p. 162 of
[CWM](#CWM). Note that if $v,w\in W_0$ are both of length $n$, then
there is a path in $\mathcal{G}_n$ from $v$ to $w$:  Take the canonical
path from $v$ to $w^{(n)}$, and then extend it by reversing (using
$inv$) every edge  of the canonical path from $w$ to
$w^{(n)}$.

Given $v,w\in W_0$ of the same length $n$, our task is to show that
for any path from $v$ to $w$ in $\mathcal{G}_n$, applying $\mathcal{I}$ to
the arrows of the path and composing in $B$ results in the same arrow
$v_b\to w_b$ in $B$, independently of the choice of path.  In
other words, we would like to prove the theorem obtained from
replacing $W$ by $W_0$ and $\mathcal{G}'_n$ by $\mathcal{G}_n$ in the first
version of the coherence theorem.  

As a preparation, we start with the following degenerate case, that
can be proved (as usual) by induction on $s$ and $s'$.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
There are no parallel directed arrows in $\mathcal{G}_n$:  If $s,s'\in S$
are directed arrows with $dom(s) = dom(s')$ and $cod(s) =
cod(s')$, then $s=s'$. 
=--

Now, take some path $s_1,\ldots,s_m$ from $v$ to $w$, as in

[[Coh_fig_1.gif:pic]]

In $B$, we have the corresponding path (note that both in $\mathcal{G}_n$
and in $B$, it is possible that some of the vertices are in fact equal)

[[Coh_fig_2.gif:pic]]

In our original path, it is possible that some arrows (some $s_i$'s)
are anti-directed.  We can replace each anti-directed arrow by its formal
inverse so that we are left only with directed arrows.
For example, if $s_2$ and $s_3$ are the only 
anti-directed arrows in our path, then after formally inverting them we
get the following series of arrows in $\mathcal{G}_n$:

[[Coh_fig_3.gif:pic]]
 
In $B$, we get

[[Coh_fig_4.gif:pic]]

Let us write $can(u)$ for the canonical path from $u\in W_0$ with
$len(u)=n$ and with $u \neq w^{(n)}$ to $w^{(n)}$.  Let
us also write $\mathcal{I}(can(u))$ for the arrow of $B$ obtained by
composing $\mathcal{I}$ of all arrows of $can(u)$.  Suppose that all
squares in the following diagram of $B$ commute:

[[Coh_fig_5.gif:pic]]

(where we write $w_b^{(n)}$ for $[w^{(n)}]_b$).
This would imply that all squares in 

[[Coh_fig_6.gif:pic]]

commute, which also implies that the outer rectangle commutes, that
is:

$$
\mathcal{I}(s_m)\circ \cdots \circ\mathcal{I}(s_1) = \mathcal{I}(can(w))^{-1}\circ \mathcal{I}(can(v)).
$$

The right-hand side  depends only on $w$
and $v$ (and not on the particular choice of the path $s_1,\ldots
s_m$), which is exactly what we would like to prove.  Hence, it is
sufficient to show that all squares in the last but one diagram commute.  For
this, it is clearly sufficient to prove the following
proposition:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
Let $v\in W_0$ be a word of length $n$, different from $w^{(n)}$.  Then
applying $\mathcal{I}$ to 
any two directed paths (paths consisting only of directed arrows) from
$v$ to $w^{(n)}$ results in two paths in $B$ that have the same
composition in $B$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
The proof is by induction on $\rho(v)$. For the basis, if $\rho(v)=0$
then $v = w^{(n)}$ and the assertion is trivial. Suppose, therefore, that
$\rho(v)$>$0$ and the assertion is 
true for all $v'\in W_0$ with $\rho(v')$<$\rho(v)$.  For reasons that
will be understood later, we will prove this part by one additional
induction: on the length $len(v)$. 

Hence, we have to prove that if the assertion holds for all $v'$ of
rank smaller than $r := \rho(v)$ and for all $v'$ of rank $r$ and length
smaller than $n$ (for $n$>$1$ -- the basis for $n=1$ is trivial as then 
$v' = (-) = w^{(1)}$), then it holds also for all $v'$ of rank $r$   
and length $n$.

From $\rho(v)$>$0$ we know that $v\neq - $, and hence
there exist $u,w\in W_0$ such that $v = u\otimes w$.  Consider two
paths from $v$ to $w^{(n)}$. Let $\beta\in S$ be the first edge of
the first path, and let $\gamma\in S$ be the first edge of the second
path (so that in particular $dom(\beta) = v = dom(\gamma)$).
Write $v':=cod(\beta)$ and $v'':=cod(\gamma)$, so that in
$\mathcal{G}_n$ we have 

[[Coh_fig_7.gif:pic]]

Since $\rho(v')$<$\rho(v)$ and $\rho(v'')$<$\rho(v)$, by hypothesis any two paths from $v'$ to $w^{(n)}$ have the same composition in $B$, and similarly for $v''$. In particular, if $\beta = \gamma$, then we are done:

[[Coh_fig_8.gif:pic]]

So, we will continue by assuming that $\beta\neq \gamma$. Note that in
this case $v'\neq v''$, because it can verified by induction that
there are no parallel arrows in $\mathcal{G}_n$.  In this
case, it will be sufficient to find some $z\in W_0$ of length $n$ and directed
paths (recall that here a directed path is a path consisting
only of directed arrows) in $\mathcal{G}_n$ from $v'$ to $z$ and from
$v''$ to $z$ such that applying $\mathcal{I}$ to the following diamond
(upper part of the diagram) results in a 
commutative diamond in $B$: 

[[Coh_fig_9.gif:pic]]

(the outer paths are our two paths from $v$ to $w^{(n)}$). This is indeed
enough, because by hypothesis, the two lower trapezoids are
commutative in $B$.  

The existence of $z\in W_0$ and of directed paths from $v'$ and $v''$
to $z$ such that the above diamond is commutative in $B$ will be proved
by considering all possible cases for $\beta$ and $\gamma$.  For
$\beta$, we have three possibilities: 

* $\beta = \beta'\hat{\otimes} 1\tilde{w}$ for some $\tilde{w}\in W_0$ and some 
directed $\beta'\in S$.  In this case

$$
v = u\otimes w = dom(\beta) = dom(\beta')\otimes \tilde{w} 
$$

and therefore $dom(\beta') = u$ and $\tilde{w}=w$ (by standard ''unique
decomposition'' of terms in a first-order language).  Also, 
$v' = cod(\beta) = cod(\beta')\otimes w $.

* $\beta = 1\tilde{u}\hat{\otimes}\beta'' $ for some $\tilde{u}\in W_0$ and some
directed $\beta''\in S$. As above, we get in this case that
$dom(\beta'') =w$ and $\tilde{u} = u$. Also, 
$v' = cod(\beta) = u\otimes cod(\beta'')$.

* $\beta = \alpha \tilde{u} s t$ for some $\tilde{u},s,t\in W_0$, in which
case 

$$
v = u\otimes w = dom(\beta) = \tilde{u}\otimes (s\otimes t),
$$

so that $\tilde{u} = u$ and $w = s\otimes t$.  Also, $v' = cod(\beta) =
(u\otimes s)\otimes t$. 

In summary, we have the following 3 cases for $\beta$:

* Case $1_{\beta}$: $\beta = \beta'\hat{\otimes} 1w$ for some directed
$\beta'\in S$ with $dom(\beta')=u$. Also, $v' = 
cod(\beta')\otimes w$. 

* Case $2_{\beta}$: $\beta = 1u \hat{\otimes} \beta''$ for some
directed $\beta''\in S$ with $dom(\beta'') = w$. Also, $v' =
u\otimes cod(\beta'')$. 

* Case $3_{\beta}$: $\beta = \alpha u s t$ for some $s,t\in W_0$,
and also $w = s\otimes t$ and $v' = (u\otimes s)\otimes t$.

Similarly, we have Case $1_{\gamma}$, Case $2_{\gamma}$ and Case
$3_{\gamma}$ for $\gamma$.  We will now consider each one of the 
possible cases for $\beta$ and $\gamma$:

$1_{\beta}$ and $1_{\gamma}$: The situation is as follows:

[[Coh_fig_10.gif:pic]]

Since $len(u)$<$len(v)$ (as $w\in W_0$ cannot be $e_0$) and since

$$
\rho(u) = \rho(v) - (\underbrace{\rho(w)}_{\geq 0} +
\underbrace{len(w) - 1}_{\geq 0}) \leq \rho(v), 
$$

it follows from the induction hypothesis that any two directed paths
from $u$ to $w^{(len(u))}$ have the same composition in $B$.  In
particular, applying $\mathcal{I}$ to the following diamond in
$\mathcal{G}_{len(u)}$ results in a commutative diamond in $B$: 

[[Coh_fig_11.gif:pic]]

Since $\otimes_B$ is a bifunctor, it follows that the following diagram
is again commutative when interpreted in $B$:

[[Coh_fig_12.gif:pic]]

(where for $x\in W_0$ with $len(x) = len(u)$, we write
$can(x)\hat{\otimes}  1 w$ for the directed path in $\mathcal{G}_n$ obtained by
$\hat{\otimes}$-ing each arrow of $can(x)$ from the right with $1 w$).
This completes the proof for the current case.

$2_{\beta}$ and $2_{\gamma}$:  Proved similarly to the
previous case.

$1_{\beta}$ and $2_{\gamma}$ (or $2_{\beta}$ and $1_{\gamma}$): We
have the following diamond: 

[[Coh_fig_13.gif:pic]]

which commutes in $B$, because $\otimes_B$ is a bifunctor.

$3_{\beta}$ or $3_{\gamma}$:  W.l.o.g.,
we will assume $3_{\beta}$. Note that in this case, it is not
possible that also $3_{\gamma}$ holds, that is, that $\gamma = \alpha u s'
t'$ for some $s',t'$ with $w = s'\otimes t'$, 
for then $s'\otimes t' = s \otimes t$, which implies that 
$s' = s$ and $t' = t$, so that $\gamma = \beta$, contradicting our assumption.  So, we have to consider only
$1_{\gamma}$ and $2_{\gamma}$. For $1_{\gamma}$, we have 
$\gamma = \gamma'\hat{\otimes} 1 \underbrace{s\otimes t}_{w}$ and $dom(\gamma') = u$, and we get the following diamond:

[[Coh_fig_14.gif:pic]]

which commutes in $B$ by the naturality of $\alpha^{(B)}$.

For $2_{\gamma}$ ($\gamma =1 u\hat{\otimes} \gamma''$ and 
$dom(\gamma'') = w = s\otimes t$), we have to consider the three possible cases for $\gamma''$. 

If $\gamma'' = 1\tilde{s}\hat{\otimes} \delta$ for some 
$\tilde{s}\in W_0$ and some directed $\delta\in S$, then by comparing
domains we get $s\otimes t = dom(\gamma'') = \tilde{s}\otimes
dom(\delta)$, which implies that $\tilde{s} =s$ and $dom(\delta) = t$,
that is, $\gamma'' = 1 s \hat{\otimes} \delta $ with $dom(\delta) =
t$. Hence we get the diamond

[[Coh_fig_15.gif:pic]]

which commutes in $B$, because $\alpha^{(B)}$ is natural. 

The case where $\gamma'' = \delta\hat{\otimes} 1\tilde{t}$ for some $\tilde{t}\in W_0$ and some
directed $\delta\in S$ can be treated similarly.

Finally, if $\gamma'' = \alpha r p q$, then
by comparing domains we get $s\otimes t = dom(\gamma'') =
r\otimes(p\otimes q)$, and therefore $r = s$ and $t = p\otimes
q$. Hence, $\gamma'' = \alpha s p q$ and $t = p\otimes q$.  In this
case, the two first edges $\beta$, $\gamma$ in our two paths from $v$
to $w^{(n)}$ look like part of the coherent pentagon (Eq. (5) on
p. 162 of [CWM](#CWM)): 

[[Coh_fig_16.gif:pic]]

All edges in the above pentagon are directed, and the diagram is obviously
commutative in $B$ (as $B$ is monoidal). This completes the proof of
the proposition.

## Including the unit and the unitors ##

Note:  By Kelly's 1964 paper, we know that the pentagon identity and
one triangle identity are all that is required (that the two other triangle
identities follow from the above is shown both in [CWM](#CWM) an in Kelly,
while the fact that $\lambda^{(B)}_{e_B} = \varrho^{(B)}_{e_B}$ follows from the
pentagon and the triangle identities is proved in Kelly).  From this
point on, we will be using freely all identities from pp. 162-163 of
[CWM](#CWM).

Still need to fill this. The following are the highlights.

First, show that any directed path in path in $\mathcal{G}'_n$ may be replaced by
a path with the same starting and ending vertices in which all
associators (if any) are at the end, and with the same composition in
$B$ as the original path.  The main ingredient in the following proposition:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
Let 

$$
u \stackrel{s'}{\to} u' \stackrel{s''}{\to} u''
$$

be two directed arrows of $\mathcal{G}'_n$ with an associator  appearing in
$s'$ and a unitor appearing in $s''$ (note: the definition of
''directed'' is extended in an obvious way to include unitors). Then
either there exists a directed  arrow $u\stackrel{s_1}{\to} u''$
containing a unitor with $\mathcal{I}(s_1)=\mathcal{I}(s'')\circ\mathcal{I}(s')$, or
there exist directed $s_1$, $s_2$ as in

$$
u \stackrel{s_1}{\to} ? \stackrel{s_2}{\to} u''
$$

with $s_1$ containing a unitor, $s_2$ containing an associator, and
$\mathcal{I}(s_2)\circ\mathcal{I}(s_1) = \mathcal{I}(s'')\circ\mathcal{I}(s')$.
=--

This proposition may be proved by a long and tedious induction on $s'$
and $s''$.

+-- {: .query}
For this I needed the triangle identities and the
naturality of $\alpha^{(B)}$ (as mentioned in [CWM](#CWM)), but also the naturality
of $\varrho^{(B)}$ and $\lambda^{(B)}$, as well as the bifunctoriality of
$\otimes_B$.  For example, consider:

[[Coh_fig_17.gif:pic]]

(where some associator appears in $\beta$).
So -- what am I missing here?
=--

Recall that our original goal is to show that any two paths
in $\mathcal{G}'_n$ with the same starting vertex and the same ending
vertex have the same composition in $B$.  There is still a path from
any vertex of $\mathcal{G}'_n$ to $w^{(n)}$ (first remove all units, then
proceed as in the case of $\mathcal{G}_n$), and we can use exactly the
same method used above (when only the associator was considered) to
reduce the problem to:  Any two _directed_ paths of $\mathcal{G}'_n$
starting at some vertex $v$ and ending at $w^{(n)}$ have the same
composition in $B$. From what we have seen above, any two arbitrary
such paths may be replaced be two paths starting with unitors and
ending with associators, as in

[[Coh_fig_18.gif:pic]]

Here, $clean(v)$ is the word obtained by removing all instances of
the unit from $v$ (this can be defined rigorously by induction), and
$r$ is the total number of units appearing in $v$.
The right part of the last diagram, where there are no units and
unitors, commutes in $B$ by the ''coherence 
for the associator'' that was already proved.  Hence, it remains to
prove that the left part, where all arrows involve unitors, commutes
in $B$ (''coherence for the unitors''). 

First one must prove that two parallel directed arrows with unitors in
$\mathcal{G}'_n$ have the same interpretation in $B$ .   
Recall that in $\mathcal{G}_n$ (no units and no unitors), there are no
parallel directed arrows. However, this is not the case in
$\mathcal{G}'_n$ (for example, consider $\lambda e_0\otimes e_0,1
e_0\hat{\otimes} \lambda e_0, 1 e_0\hat{\otimes} \varrho e_0\colon
e_0\otimes(e_0\otimes e_0)\rightrightarrows e_0\otimes e_0$). Hence,
we must settle for equality of the interpretations in
$B$.

+-- {: .query}
For this, I used induction on the total number of
$\hat{\otimes}$ in both $s$ and $s'$, using $\varrho^{(B)}_{e_B}=\lambda^{(B)}_{e_B}$
and the naturality of $\varrho^{(B)}$ and $\lambda^{(B)}$.  Am I missing
something here?  Is there an obvious one-line argument that I'm
failing to see?
=--

Now, we can finally prove coherence for the unitors, by induction on
the number $r$ of units in $v$. Considering the
left part of the last diagram,  if $u_1=u'_1$, as in 

[[Coh_fig_19.gif:pic]]

then the parallel arrows are equal in $B$, while the
''large diamond'' on the right commutes in $B$ by the induction
hypothesis.

We can therefore assume that $u_1 \neq u'_1$. As in the case of
coherence for the associator, it is sufficient to  
find a commutative diamond, that is, to find some vertex $w$ of
$\mathcal{G}'_n$ and directed arrows $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ in $S'$
containing unitors, as in 

[[Coh_fig_20.gif:pic]]

such that the diamond on the left commutes in $\mathcal{B}$:  
If we find such $w$, $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$, then since by the
induction hypothesis the upper and lower parallelograms on the right
commute in $B$, we are done.

Finally, the required commutative diamond may be found by induction on
$v$.

## Proof of version 2 of the coherence (Theorem VII.2.1 of [CWM](#CWM)) ##

I intend to come back and fill this.  The most
difficult part was already proved above.

## The construction of $F[1]$ and proof of universality #
The category $\mathcal{W}$ has one-element hom-sets by construction, but
it was not at all obvious that it is indeed the free monoidal
category on one generator. Alternatively, it is possible to construct
a category $F[1]$ that will be almost obviously a free monoidal
category on one generator. This would mean that $F[1]$ is isomorphic
to $\mathcal{W}$, and in particular has one-element hom-sets. The fact
that $F[1]$ is free and has one-element hom-sets may then serve as
yet a third version of coherence.
