#Idea#
One sense of the term **homotopy type** is that is refers to a [[topological space]] 'considered up to' [[weak homotopy equivalence]].  

More precisely, weak homotopy equivalences between spaces give an equivalence relation on the class of topological spaces, and referring to a _homotopy type_ means that you are to consider properties of a space that are shared by any of the spaces weakly equivalent to it and thus in that equivalence class.  In this expanded sense, therefore, a **homotopy type** is such a weak equivalence class of spaces. Using the terminology from [[homotopy category]], two spaces _have the same homotopy type_ if they are isomorphic in $\mathit{Ho}(\Spaces)$. 

By standard theorems, homotopy types can also be 'modeled' by many other structures, such as

* [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]] up to weak homotopy equivalence;
* small [[category|categories]] up to weak homotopy equivalence of their nerves;
* $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] up to category-theoretic [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] (this is the content of the [[homotopy hypothesis]]).

In most cases the tools of [[homotopy theory]], in particular [[model category|model categories]], can be used to establish these equivalences.

The sense of 'modeled' is related to Whithead's [[algebraic homotopy theory]]. A setting such as those above acts as a model for homotopy types if there are comparison functors between $\Spaces$ and the category, and some notion of homotopy within the category yielding an equivalence of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]]. 

#Discussion#
* Although the notion of homotopy type is defined for arbitrary spaces, it is most usual to restrict attention to 'locally [[nice topological space|nice]]' spaces such as polyhedra (i.e. realisations of [[simplicial complex|simplicial complexes]] or CW-complexes). Various other classes of space occur naturally in various parts of mathematics in particular in analysis and algebraic geometry and there the methods of abstract homotopy theory provide a way of mimicking the basic idea of homotopy type as described above. 

*  Using variants of 'weak equivalence', for instance, '$n$-equivalence', one gets  coarser notions of equivalence which can be very useful. The particular case of $n$-equivalence leads to the related notion of [[homotopy n-type]].
