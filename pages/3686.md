## Definition

### Symplectomorphisms

A **symplectomorphism** from a [[symplectic manifold]] $(M,\omega)$ to a symplectic manifold $(N,\nu)$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] $f : M \to N$ preserving the [[sympletic form]]: in other words $f$ is a differentiable map with differentiable inverse and it satisfies $f^*(\nu)=\omega$. 

### Auto-symplectomorphisms

The symplectomorphisms from a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ to itself form an infinite-dimensional [[Lie group]]. Its [[Lie algebra]] is that of [[symplectic vector fields]]: those vector fields $v \Gamma(T X)$ such that their [[Lie derivative]] preserves the [[symplectic form]]
