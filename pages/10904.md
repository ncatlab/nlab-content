Some of my (hopefully more relevant) interests: 

<li>Duality in (and between) philosophy and mathematics</li>

<li>Philosophical interpretations of adjointness (and adjointness in philosophical concepts!)</li>

<li>Dialectic (esp. Platonic dialectic) and formalization (formalization of dialectic, dialectic of formalization)</li>

<li>Reflexivity, reflection, self-reference, and indexicality in philosophy and mathematics</li>

<li>Fixed point theorems and reflection principles</li>

<li>The ontology of algebraic structures, especially groups</li> 

<li>Intensionality and extensionality</li>

<li>Equivalences among the different ways that first-order theories can be exceeded, extended, and broken</li>

<li>Metalogic as ethics</li>
