## Idea

_Dependent type theory_ is the flavor of [[type theory]] that admits _[[dependent types]]_.

Its [[categorical semantics]] is in [[locally cartesian closed categories]] $C$, where a [[dependent type]]

$$
  x : X \vdash E(x) : Type
$$

is interpreted as a [[morphism]]  $E \to X$, hence an [[object]] in the [[slice category]] $C_{/X}$.

Then change of [[context]] corresponds to [[base change]] in $C$. See also _[[dependent sum]]_ and _[[dependent product]]_.

Dependent type systems are heavily used for _[[certified programming|software certification]]_. 

They also seem to support a [[foundations]] of mathematics in terms of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Properties

###### Theorem

The [[functors]] 

* $Cont$, that form a [[category of contexts]] of a [[locally cartesian closed category]];

* $Lang$ that forms the [[internal language]] of a locally cartesian closed category

constitute an [[equivalence of categories]]
