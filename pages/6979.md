## Idea

_Dependent type theory_ is the flavor of [[type theory]] that admits _[[dependent types]]_.

Its [[categorical semantics]] is in [[locally cartesian closed categories]] $C$, where a [[dependent type]]

$$
  x : X \vdash E(x) : Type
$$

is interpreted as a [[morphism]]  $E \to X$, hence an [[object]] in the [[slice category]] $C_{/X}$.

Then change of [[context]] corresponds to [[base change]] in $C$. See also _[[dependent sum]]_ and _[[dependent product]]_.

Dependent type systems are heavily used for _software verification_. 

They also seem to support a [[foundations]] of mathematics in terms of [[homotopy type theory]].
