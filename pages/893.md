Classical logic is the form of [[logic]] usually accepted as standard and traced back (at least) to Aristotle.  The particular features that distinguish classical logic are (perhaps not a complete list):
* a [[distributive lattice]] of logical operations ($\wedge$ and $\vee$);
* the [[structural rule]]s of weakening, contraction, and (where meaningful) exchange;
* an involutory [[negation]].

In contrast, [[minimal logic|minimal]], [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]], and (some forms of) [[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]] logics have the distrbutive lattice and the structural rules but no involutory negation.  On the other hand, [[linear logic]] and (other forms of) paraconsistent logic have the distributive lattice and the involutory negation but lack some structural rules.  Then again, [[quantum logic]] and (yet other forms of) paraconsistent logic have the structural rules and the involutory negation but lack the distributive lattice.

In [[category theory]] (and in the [[foundations]] of mathematics generally), intuitionistic logic is most often contrasted to classical logic; the difference is given by the law of [[excluded middle]], which holds classically but not intuitionistically.
