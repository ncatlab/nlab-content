## Idea

Kramers-Wannier duality is a [[duality in physics]] of the [[Ising model]] [[2d CFT]].

## Related concepts

* [[Euclidean field theory]]

## References

Discussion in the context of the [[FRS-formalism]] [[QFT with defects|with defects]] includes

Here in [[FRS-formalism]] a [[2d CFT]] is formalized as a [[boundary field theory]] to a 3d [[TQFT]] based on the [[Turaev-Viro model]], similar to the [[CS-WZW correspondence]].
