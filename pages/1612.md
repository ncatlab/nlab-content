## Idea ##

A _modular tensor category_ is roughly a [[category]] that encodes the _topological_ structure underlying a rational 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]]. In other words, it is a basis-independent formulation of _Moore-Seiberg data_.

It is in particular a [[fusion category]] that is also a [[ribbon category]] such that the "modularity operation" is non-degenerate (this is what the name "modular tensor category" comes from):

this means that for $i,j \in I$ indices for representatives of simple objects $U_i$, $U_j$, the matrix 
$$
  (s^{i j}) = (U_i\text{-circle threading through the} \, U_j\text{ -circle})
$$
is non-degenerate.

Here on the right what is meant is the diagram in the modular tensor category made from the identity morphisms, the duality morphisms and the braiding morphism on the objects $U_i$ and $U_j$ that looks like a figure-eight with one circle threading through the other, and this diagram is interpreted as an element in the endomorphism space of the tensor unit object, which in turn is canonically identified with the [[ground field]].

In the description of 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]] in the [[FFRS-formalism]] it is manifestly this kind of modular diagram that encodes the torus partition function of the CFT. This explains the relevance of modular tensor categories in the description of [[conformal field theory]].

Since 2-dimensional conformal field theory is related by a [[holographic principle]] to 3-dimensional [[TQFT]], modular tensor categories also play a role there, which was in fact understood before the full application in conformal field theory was: in the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]].


## Definition ##

A **modular tensor category** is a [[category]] with the following long list of extra structure.

>needs to be put in more coherent form, just a stub

* it is an [[abelian category]], $\mathbb{C}$-linear (i.e. $Vect_{\mathbb{C}}$ [[enriched category]]), [[semisimple category]] [[monoidal category|tensor category]]

* the tensor unit is a simple object, $I$ 
  a finite set of representatives of isomorphism classes of simple objects

* [[fusion category]]

* [[braided monoidal category]]

* [[ribbon category]], in particular objects have duals

* **modularity** a non-degeneracy condition on the braiding given by an isomorphism of algebras
  $$
    K(C) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} End(Id_C)
  $$
  where
  $$
    [U] \mapsto \alpha_U
  $$
  where the transformation $\alpha_U$ is given on the simple object $V$ by
  $$
    \alpha_U(V) = \text{straight } V\text{-line encircled by } U\text{-loop}
  $$
  (on the right we use string diagram notation)

## Examples

### Rep categories of VOAs

Many modular tensor categories arise as [[representation]] categories of [[vertex operator algebras]] (see there for more details), hence of chiral [[field (physics)|fields]] of [[2d conformal field theories]]. 

A database of examples is given by ([GannonH&#246;hn](#GannonHoehn)).


{#RelationToConformalBlocks} In this case the [[monoidal category|monoidal]] and the [[braided monoidal category|braided]] [[structure]] (hence the modular tensor structure) on the underlying representation category is entirely fixed by the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[2 CFT]] on the [[Riemann sphere]] (the "genus zero conformal blocks"), see eg. [Runkel, Sec. 4.3](#Runkel)
