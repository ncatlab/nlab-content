##Idea##
**Closure algebras** are type one [[modal algebras]], in which  the single operator behaves like a closure operation in a topological space.
##Closure algebras##

######Definition######
A **closure algebra** is a Boolean algebra, $(\mathbb{B}, m)$, which satisfies:
for all $x$, $x + m m x \leq m x$.
=--
### Example###  
Let $X$ be a topological space and $\mathbb{P}(X)$ the powerset Boolean algebra of the underlying set of $X$.  Set $mT$ to be the closure of the set $T\subseteq X$ in the topology of $X$, then $(\mathbb{P}(X),m)$ is a closure algebra.

In general, if $(\mathbb{B},m)$ is a closure algebra and $x\in B$, we say that $x$ is _closed_ if $mx = x$ and _open_ if $lx = x$, where $l$ is the dual operator of $m$.

A closure algebra is sometimes written in terms of $l$ instead of $m$ and is then called an **interior algebra**.

###Properties###
*  If $\mathfrak{B} = (\mathbb{B}, m)$ is a closure algebra, let $Open(\mathfrak{B})$ be the set of open elements in $\mathfrak{B}$, then $Open(\mathfrak{B})$ has the natural structure of a [[Heyting algebra]].  Moreover any Heyting algebra can be represented as the algebra of open elements of a closure algebra.

* Closure algebras underly the algebraic semantic models of the [[epistemic logic]], $S4$.

* The algebraic semantics of $S4(n)$ uses polyclosure algebras. Here there are many different closure operators on the Boolean algebra.
