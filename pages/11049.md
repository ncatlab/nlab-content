## Idea

In the very low number of just 2 dimensions, [[quantum gravity]] is comparatively trivial and can be completely understood. While trivial as a theory of [[quantum gravity]] on a 2d spacetime, when that spacetime is regarded instead as the [[worldsheet]] of a string, then in fact the string's worldsheet [[sigma-model]] theory is a theory of 2d quantum gravity (before the usual gravitational [[gauge fixing]] in 2d, which then makes what remains a [[conformal field theory]], instead).
