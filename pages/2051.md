A discrete [[group]] $G$ is a __Hopfian group__ if every [[surjection|surjective]] [[endomorphism]] $\phi : G\to G$ is an [[isomorphism]]. Dually, a discrete group is called __coHopfian__ if any [[injection|injective]] endomorphism of $G$ is an isomorphism.

As the [[epimorphism]]s and [[monomorphism]]s in [[Grp]] are precisely the surjections and injections, the definition generalises immediately to that of a [[Hopfian object]] in any [[category]].  (But perhaps one might want to require [[regular epimorphism]]s, or ...?)

Clearly all [[finite group]]s are both Hopfian and coHopfian.
Using Nielsen's method, one can show that every finitely generated [[free group]] and the union of any ascending chain of such free groups are Hopfian. It is also known that every [[torsion-free group|torsion-free]] [[hyperbolic group]] is Hopfian.
