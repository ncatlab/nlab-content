## Idea

Denotational semantics is based on the idea that [[programs]] and the 
objects they manipulate are symbolic realizations of abstract mathematical 
objects, for example, 

*  strings of digits realize numbers, 

and 

*  function subprograms realize (approximately) mathematical functions. 

The idea of denotational semantics is thus to associate an appropriate 
mathematical object, such as a number, a tuple, or a function, with each 
phrase of the language being used.

A [[language]] will be defined syntactically by its specification. The decomposition of  phrases in a language into their subphrases is reflected in the abstract syntax of the programming language. A fundamental principle of denotational semantics is that the definition be compositional. 


## Origins

Denotational semantics originated in the work of [[Christopher Strachey]] and [[Dana Scott]] in the late 1960s
