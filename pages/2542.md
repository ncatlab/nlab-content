###### Definition
A **lined topos** is

* a [[topos]] $T$ 

* equipped with a choice of commutative [[internalization|internal]] [[ring]] object $(k,+,\cdot)$

* and equipped with a choice $(R,+,\cdot)$ of [[internalization|internal]] commutative [[algebra]] object $(R,+,\cdot)$ over $k$.

# Variations #

A refinement of the notion of lined topos is that of [[smooth topos]], where the line is required to be a smooth differentiable space in a certain way. This is the basic type of object studied in [[synthetic differential geometry]].

# Constructions in lined toposes #

The line object in a lined topos canonically gives rise a notion of $n$-[[simplex in a lined topos]].

This in turn yields canonically a notion of [[path infinity-groupoid in a lined topos]].
