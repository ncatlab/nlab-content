## Idea

The concept of _weakly distributive categories_ is a kind of [[monoidal category]] introduced by [[Robin Cockett]] and [[Robert Seely]] in 1991 at the Durham conference on applications of categories ([Cockett-Seely 97](#CockettSeely97)).  Subsequently, in recognition of their fundamental role in the [[categorical semantics]] for the [[proof theory]] of [[linear logic]] they were renamed to _linearly distributive categories_.

A key feature of linearly distributive categories is the existence of [[morphisms]] of the form

$$
   \delta \colon A \otimes (B \parr C) \longrightarrow (A \otimes B) \parr C
$$

which exhibit linear [[distributivity]].  The importance of this map had previously  been overlooked in the [[linear logic]] community due to the (continuing) tendency to write [[sequents]]  in a one-sided manner.  However, the importance of the map was gradually being realized:  for example [[Valeria de Paiva]] and [[Martin Hyland]] had independently pointed out the significance of the map.

Linearly distributive categories were introduced to modularize the [[proof theory]] of [[linear logic]] and to allow a more systematic approach to the then still unsolved [[coherence]] problems associated with the units in linear logic.  This program of work culminated in a solution which was published jointly with [[Richard Blute]] and [[Todd Trimble]] in 1996 (JPPA).  

These techniques also solved a classical open problem in [[closed monoidal categories]] concerning the behaviour of the triple dual.  [[Todd Trimble]], who was completing his PhD. at the time, provided a vital insight to the group on how this problem could be solved and this unlocked the solution to the general problem.

Linearly distributive categories are to [[polycategories]] as [[monoidal categories]] are to [[multicategories]].  Namely, when one represents "the commas" of a polycategory one obtains a linearly distributive category.  Crucially, the key coherence issues of (the multiplicative fragment of) linear logic concerning the units is already present at the linearly distributive level -- but it is no longer cluttered by the other features of linear logic.  Thus, this provided a clean substrate from which to study and isolate this coherence problem.

Contrary to the general direction of work in coherence (and, indeed, in the linear logic community) the solution to the problem (given in [BCST](#BCST)) involved an expansion reduction rewriting system modulo equations.   At that time, the prevailing  proof theoretic strategy for solving coherence problems was simply to [[cut elimination|cut-eliminate]]: usually this suffices to leave proofs in a normal form.  However, this system was notable as this strategy clearly failed: it was necessary to leave some equations in the system.  These equations, of course, involved the possible "rewiring"s of the units.  

At that time this was generally thought to be a rather unsatisfactory and unnecessarily technical solution especially when compared to the normal forms to which the community was accustomed.    However, subsequently, in 2014, Willem Heijltjes and Robin Houston ([HH2014](#HH)) showed that equality of morphism is a PSPACE complete problem.  This essentially implies that there is no practical way round this problem beyond a search of the rewiring equivalence class.

Linearly distributive categories have now been used as the substrate for a number of systems. 



## Definition

A **linearly distributive category** (also called a **weakly distributive category**) is a [[monoidal category]] in two ways, with monoidal structures $(\otimes, I)$ and $(\bullet, J)$ equipped with extra associator natural transformations

\[ \delta^L:A\otimes (B\bullet C) \to (A \otimes B) \bullet C \]

\[ \delta^R:(A\bullet B) \otimes C \to A \bullet (B \otimes C) \]

and the obvious six pentagon equations and four triangle equations that make the monoidal structures work together nicely.

These extra associators are sometimes called "distributors", and should not be confused with [[profunctors]].  The term is a pun on the distributivity of multiplication over addition, but "linearized" so that each variable only appears once in the result.

**Warning:** a linearly distributive category *cannot* be a [[distributive category]], unless it is a partial order.
