## Definition ##
A **linearly distributive category** (also called a **weakly distributive category**) is a [[monoidal category]] in two ways, with monoidal structures $(\otimes, I)$ and $(\bullet, J)$ equipped with extra associator natural transformations
\[ \delta^L:A\otimes (B\bullet C) \to (A \otimes B) \bullet C \]
\[ \delta^R:(A\bullet B) \otimes C \to A \bullet (B \otimes C) \]
and the obvious six pentagon equations and four triangle equations that make the monoidal structures work together nicely.

These extra associators are sometimes called "distributors", and should not be confused with [[profunctors]].  The term is a pun on the distributivity of multiplication over addition, but "linearized" so that each variable only appears once in the result.

**Warning:** a linearly distributive category is *not* a [[distributive category]].
