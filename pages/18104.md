## Idea

The method called _proof by contradiction_ is a method of [[formal proof]] using the [[principle of excluded middle]].

This principle says that for $P$ any [[proposition]], then it is either [[true]] or [[false]]. One also speaks of _[[classical logic]]_ if this principle is taken to hold. 

But this principle implies that in order to prove a [[proposition]] $P$ it is sufficient to show that its [[negation]] is [[false]], hence that assuming that $P$ were not true would lead to a "contradiction". This is _proof by contradiction_.

Proof by contradiction is used frequently in [[classical mathematics]].

While this method of proof is classical, it has some peculiar consequences. Notably when $P$ is an [[existential quantification|existential statement]] of the form "there exists an object $X$ with the property $Y$", then a proof of such existence by contradiction alone gives no means to actually construct an example. 

Therefore one also says that proof by contradiction is "non-constructive" and that an alternative proof not invoking the [[principle of excluded middle]] (if it exists) is a "constructive" proof, see at _[[constructive logic]]_ and _[[constructive mathematics]]_. 

## Relation to proof of negation

One should take care to distinguish proof by contradiction from _[[proof of negation]]_, which nevertheless involves the derivation of a contradiction: assuming the truth of $P$, a contradiction is found, and one concludes that $\neg P$. This remains [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] valid, since it simply uses the constructive _meaning_ of [[negation]] (see [Bauer 2010](#bauer)). 

Since this distinction is sometimes hard for those who have learned classical logic to the point it becomes hard to unlearn, here is another way of putting it: 

* A proof by contradiction is where you argue "suppose $P$ is false; then [argue blah blah blah]..., contradiction. Therefore $P$ is true. 

* A proof of negation is where you argue "suppose $P$ is true; then [blah blah blah]..., contradiction. Therefore $P$ is false. 

For example, the standard proofs of the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of $\sqrt{2}$ are sometimes called proofs by contradiction, but they are actually proofs of negations (showing that "$\sqrt{2}$ is rational" is false).
