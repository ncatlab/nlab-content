## Idea

The method called _proof by contradiction_ is a method of [[formal proof]] using the [[principle of excluded middle]].

This principle says that for $P$ any [[proposition]], then it is either [[true]] or [[false]]. One also speaks of _[[classical logic]]_ if this principle is taken to hold. 

But this principle implies that in order to prove a [[proposition]] $P$ it is sufficient to show that its [[negation]] is [[false]], hence that assuming that $P$ were not true would lead to a "contradiction". This is _proof by contradiction_.

Proof by contradiction is used frequently in [[classical mathematics]].

While this method of proof is classical, it has some peculiar consequences. Notably when $P$ is an [[existential quantification|existential statement]] of the form "there exists an object $X$ with the property $Y$", then a proof of such existence by contradiction alone gives no means to actually construct an example. 

One also says that proof by contradiction is "non-constructive" and that a proof not invoking the [[principle of excluded middle]] is a "constructive" proof, see at _[[constructive logic]]_ and _[[constructive mathematics]]_. 

One should take care to separate proof by contradiction from the [[proof of negation]], which nevertheless involves the derivation of a contradiction: assuming the truth of $P$, a contradiction is found, and one concludes that $\neg P$. This remains constructively valid, since it simply uses the constructive _meaning_ of [[negation]] (see [Bauer 2010]({#bauer})).
