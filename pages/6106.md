## Idea

The [[loop space]] of a [[topological group]] inherits itself the structure of a [[group]] under pointwise group multiplication of [[loops]]. This is called a _loop group_.

## Properties

Loop groups of [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]]s have canonical [[central extensions]], often called _Kac-Moody central extensions_ . A detailed discussion is in ([PressleySegal](#PressleySegal)). A review is in ([BCSS](#BCSS))
