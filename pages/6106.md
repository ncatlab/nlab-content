## Idea

The [[loop space]] of a [[topological group]] $G$ inherits the structure of a [[group]] under pointwise group multiplication of [[loops]]. This is called a _loop group_ of $G$. 

(Notice that this is a group structure in addition to the [[infinity-group]]-structure of any [[loop space]] under _composition_ of loops).

If $G$ is a [[Lie group]], then there is a smooth version of the loop group consisting of [[smooth functions]] $S^1 \to G$. By the discussion at [[manifold structure of mapping spaces]] the collection of such smooth maps is itself an [[infinite-dimensional smooth manifold]] and so the smooth loop group of a Lie group is an [[infinite-dimensional Lie group]]. 

Among all [[infinite-dimensional Lie groups]], loop groups are a most well behaved class. In particular their [[representation theory]] is similar to that of [[compact Lie groups]].

Some of these nice properties are solely due to the [[circle]] $S^1$ being a [[compact manifold]]. For $X$ any other compact manifold there is similarly an infinite-dimensional Lie group $[X,G]$ of smooth functions $X \to G$ under pointwise multiplication in $G$.

Such mapping groups appear in [[physics]] notably as groups of [[gauge transformations]] over a [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$. Accordingly, loop groups play a prominint role in 1- and 2-dimensional [[quantum field theory]], notably the [[WZW model]] describing the propagation of a [[string]] on $G$. The _[[current algebras]]_ ([[affine algebras]]) which arise as [[Lie algebras]] of ([[central extension|centrally extended]]) loop groups derive their name from this relation to physics. Accordingly, as for [[compact Lie groups]], the [[representation theory]] of loop groups is naturally understood in terms of their [[geometric quantization]] (by a loop variant of the [[orbit method]]).

On the other hand, for $X$ of [[dimension]] greater that 1 there are very few known results about the properties of the mapping group $[X,G]$. 
 
## Properties

### Lie algebra

Let $G$ be a [[compact Lie group]]. Write $\mathfrak{g}$
for its [[Lie algebra]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[Lie algebra]] of $L G$ is the [[loop Lie algebra]]

$$
  Lie(L G) \simeq L Lie(G) = L \mathfrak{g}
  \,.
$$

=--

### Complexification

Let $G$ be a [[compact Lie group]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[complexification of a Lie group|complexification]] of $L G$ is the loop group of the complexification of $G$


$$
  (L G)_{\mathbb{C}}
  \simeq
  L (G_\mathbb{C})
  \,.
$$

=--

### Central extensions

Loop groups of [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie groups]] have canonical [[central extensions]], often called _Kac-Moody central extensions_ . A detailed discussion is in ([PressleySegal](#PressleySegal)). A review is in ([BCSS](#BCSS))

### Representations
 {#Representations}

#### Positive energy

Write 

$$
  t_\theta \colon L G \to LG
$$

for the [[automorphism]] which rotates loops by an [[angle]] $\theta$. 

The corresponding [[semidirect product group]] we write $S^1 \rtimes L G$

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Let $V$ be a [[topological vector space]]. A linear representation

$$
  S^1 \to Aut(V)
$$

of the [[circle group]] is called **positive** if $\exp(i \theta)$ acts by $\exp(i A \theta)$ where $A \in End(V)$ is an [[operator]] with positive [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]].

A linear [[representation]] 

$$
  \rho : L G \to Aut(V)
$$

is said to have **positive energy** if it extends to a representation of the [[semidirect product group]] $S^1 \rtimes L G$ such that the restriction to $S^1$ is positive.

=--

#### By geometric quantization (looped orbit method)

Let $G$ be a [[compact Lie group]].
Let $T \hookrightarrow G$ be the inclusion of a [[maximal torus]]. There is a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    G/T &\to& L G / T
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && L G / G & \simeq \Omega G
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[orbit method]]_, if $G$ is a [[semisimple Lie group]], then $G/T$ is isomorphic to the [[coadjoint orbit]] of an element $\langle \lambda , -\rangle \in \mathfrak{g}^*$ for which $T \simeq G_\lambda$ is the [[stabilizer subgroup]].

If moreover $G$ is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]], then the [[weight lattice]] $\Gamma_{wt} \subset \mathfrak{t}^* \simeq \mathfrak{t}$ of the Lie group $G$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of [[group characters]]

$$
  \Gamma_{wt} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Hom_{LieGrp}(G,U(1))
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[projective representation|projective]] [[positive energy representations]] of $L G$ correspond precisley to the possible [[geometric quantizations]] of $L G / T$ (as in the [[orbit method]]). 

More in detail:

The degree-2 [[integral cohomology]] of $L G / T$ is

$$
  H^2(L G / T) \simeq \mathbb{Z} \oplus H^2(G / T, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z} \oplus \hat T
  \,.
$$

Writing $L_{n,\lambda}$ for the corresponding [[complex line bundle]] with level $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and weight $\lambda \in \hat T$ we have that 

1. the space of [[holomorphic sections]] of $L_{n,\lambda}$ is either zero or is an irreducible positive energy representation;

1. every such arises this way;

1. and is non-zero precisely if $(n,\lambda)$ is positive  in the sense that for each positive [[coroot]] $h_\alpha$ of $G$

   $$
     0 \leq \lambda(h_\alpha) \leq n \langle h_\alpha, h_\alpha\rangle
    \,.
   $$
