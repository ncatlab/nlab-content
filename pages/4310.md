A **biring** is a ring $R$ equipped with extra structure such that the functor

$$ hom(-, R) : Ring \to Set $$

lifts to a functor

$$ hom(-, R) : Ring \to Ring $$

Birings form a monoidal category thanks to composition of functors, and a monoid in this monoidal category is called a [[plethory]].
