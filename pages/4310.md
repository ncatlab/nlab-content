A **biring** is a commutative ring $R$ equipped with ring homomorphisms called **coaddition**:

$$ R \to R \otimes R $$

**cozero**:

$$ R \to \mathbb{Z} $$

**co-additive inverse**:

$$ R \to R $$

**comultiplication**:

$$ R \to R \otimes R $$

and the **multiplicative counit**:

$$ R \to \mathbb{Z} $$

satisfying the usual axioms of a commutative ring, but 'turned around'.  More precisely, a biring is a [[internalization|commutative ring object]] in the opposite of the category of commutative rings (also known as the category of [[affine schemes]]).  Equivalently, a biring is a commutative ring $R$ equipped with a lift of the functor 

$$ hom(-, R) : CommRing \to Set $$

to a functor

$$ hom(-, R) : CommRing \to CommRing $$

Birings form a monoidal category thanks to composition of functors, and a monoid in this monoidal category is called a [[plethory]].  A plethory is an example of a [[Tall-Wraith monoid]].
