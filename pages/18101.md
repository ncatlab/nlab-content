## Idea

Generally, a _step function_ is a  [[function]] from the [[real numbers]] to themselves which is [[constant function|constant]] everywhere except at one single point (or a [[finite number]] of points).

Specifically the function

$$
  \Theta \colon x
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      0 &\vert& x \lt 0
      \\
      1 &\vert& x \geq 0
    }
  \right.
$$

is sometimes called the _Heaviside step function_. If this is regarded as a [[distribution]] then it is also called the _Heaviside distribution_.
