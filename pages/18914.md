## Idea

For a [[Lagrangian field theory]], the _classical Ward identity_ is an [[on-shell]] [[equation]] satisfied by classical [[observables]] due to [[symmetries]] of the [[action functional]]. For quantum observables it is not automatic, but one may consider imposing it as a constraint on the choice of [[renormalization]]. As such it is called the _quantum master Ward identity_ (really a condition). It is closely related to the [[Schwinger-Dyson equation]].
