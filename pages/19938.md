## Idea

_Dialgebras_ subsume the notion of [[algebras for an endofunctor]] and [[coalgebras for an endofunctor]].


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For [[categories]] $C, D$ and [[functors]] $F, G: C \to D$, a __dialgebra__ of $F$ and $G$ (or an $(F, G)$-dialgebra) is an [[object]] $X$ in $C$ (the __carrier__) and a [[morphism]] $\alpha\colon F(X) \to G(X)$.

A [[homomorphism]] between two $(F, G)$-dialgebras $(X, \alpha)$ and $(Y, \beta)$ is a morphism $m\colon X \to Y$ in $C$ such that the following [[commuting diagram|square commutes]] (that is, that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ form $X$- and $Y$-components of a [[natural transformation]] from $F$ to $G$):

$$ 
  \array{ 
    F(X) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(m)}{\rightarrow} 
    & 
    F(Y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \beta 
    \\ G(X) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(m)}{\rightarrow} & G(Y) 
  }
  \,. 
$$

[[composition|Composition]] of such morphisms of algebras is given by composition of the underlying morphisms in $C$.  This yields the [[category]] of $(F, G)$-dialgebras, $\text{Dialg}(F, G)$, which comes with a forgetful functor to $C$.

###### Remark

When $C = D$, then an [[algebra for an endofunctor]] is simply an $(F, id_C)$-dialgebra and a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]] is simply an $(id_C, F)$-dialgebra.

## Relationship to inductive-inductive types

Initial dialgebras provide [[categorical semantics]] for [[inductive-inductive types]]. 

## Relationship to program semantics (process calculi)

Dialgebras can be used to provide semantics to interactive programs; [[coalgebras]] have also been frequently used for the purpose. In contrast, dialgebras provide a natural way to express interactions (using the functor $F$). Semantics in dialgebras is not obtained via final objects (which are frequently absent in categories of dialgebras), but rather via quotients.
