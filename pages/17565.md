### Idea

**Logical schemes** are geometric entities which relate to [[first-order logical theories]] in much the same way that algebraic [[schemes]] relate to [[commutative rings]]. They are used to establish a [[categorification]] of [[Stone duality]] relating first-order theories and their categories of models. This is an alternative to the approach via [[ultracategories]]. In this framework [[conceptual completeness]] can be established.
