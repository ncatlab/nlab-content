## Terminology

A twisted arrow category is an alternative name for a [[category of factorisations]]. That latter name is applied when discussing natural systems  and [[Baues-Wirsching cohomology]], whilst the name _twisted arrow category_ is more often used in discussing Kan extensions and within the categorical literature.


## Definition

The twisted arrow category $Tw(C)$ of $C$ a category is the [[category of elements]] of its [[hom-functor]]: 
\[ 
Tw(C) = el(hom) = * / hom 
\]


## Explicit description

Unpacking the well-known explicit construction of [[comma object|comma objects]] in $\mathbf{Cat}$ as [[comma category|comma categories]], we get that $Tw(C)$ has

* objects: $f$ an arrow in $C$, and

* morphisms: between $f$ and $g$ are pairs of arrows $(p,q)$ such that the following diagram commutes:
\[
\begin{matrix}
  A             & \overset{p}{\leftarrow}   & C            \\
  f \downarrow  &                           & \downarrow g \\
  B             & \underset{q}{\to}         & D
\end{matrix}
\]
you could view then morphisms from $f$ to $g$ as *factorizations* of $g$ through $f$; this is in fact a good way of getting the arrows directions above right.


## Origin of the name

From the description above, $Tw(C)$ is the same as $Arr(C)$ the [[arrow category]] of $C$, but with the direction of $p$ above in the def of morphism *reversed*, hence the twist. 


## Properties

From its definition as a comma category, there's a functor (a [[discrete opfibration]], in fact) 
\[ 
\pi_C \colon tw(C) \to C^{op} \times C 
\] 
which at the level of objects forgets the arrows:
\[
\pi_C(f \colon A \to B) = (A,B) 
\] 
and keeps everything at the morphisms level. 


### $tw(C)$ and wedges

One could say that $tw(C)$ *classifies* [[wedge|wedges]], in the sense of for a functor $F \colon C^{op} \times C \to B$ 

* [[extranatural transformation|extranatural transformations]] $ e \stackrel{\bullet}{\to} F $ 

are the same as

* [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] $ e \to F \circ \pi_C $ 

This can be used to give a proof of the reduction of [[end|ends]] to [[conical limit|conical limits]] in the $\mathbf{Set}$-enriched case.
