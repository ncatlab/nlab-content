## Idea

What is called _Borel-Moore homology_ is a [[homology theory]] for suitably nice ([[locally compact topological spaces|locally compact]]) [[topological spaces]], which was introduced in terms of [[sheaf cohomology]] in ([Borel-Moore 60](#BorelMoore60)). Later it was observed that the homology groups obtained this way have the following equivalent description: They arise simply by generalizing in the ordinary definition of [[singular homology]] the finite [[formal linear combinations]] to _locally finite_ ones. Accordingly, one speaks also of _locally finite homology_ ([Spamnier 1993](#Spamnier1993)). A detailed account is in ([Hughes-Ranicki 96](#HughesRanicki96)).

A key property of Borel-Moore/locally finite homology is that on nice enough topological spaces $X$ it is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the [[ordinary homology]] of the [[one-point compactification]] of $X$.
It is in this way that the theory is often used in practice, as a means for computing homology of one-point compactifications.

The proof of this statement is indicated in ([Hughes-Ranicki 96](#HughesRanicki96)), it passes through comparison with [[Steenrod homology]] via results of ([Milnor 95](#Milnor95)).
