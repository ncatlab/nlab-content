Some consider the concept of quasigroup to be an example of [[centipede mathematics]] and uninteresting due to their lack of deep applications (the latter opinion on quasigroups and loops is however getting obsolete in view of modern examples and applications).  For example, one mathematician has written:

>The meeting was dominated by algebraic loop theory.  It occured to me that as a way to use your intellectual resources this was very akin in significance to doing a difficult sudoku, a thought that was made very ironic when one speaker started making loops out of what were essentially sudoku squares.

Nonetheless it can be instructive to ponder these concepts, and there are some nontrivial examples.
