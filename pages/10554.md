This entry is about terminological, historical and opinionated issues on binary operations/algebraic structures, in particular nonassociative ones: magmas, quasigroups, racks and quandles in particular.

Historically, one most often considered everywhere defined binary algebraic operations; however partial operations are also sometimes considered. [[Oystein Ore]] termed everywhere defined operations groupoidal, hence a set with one binary operation, everywhere defined has been called groupoid. If the operation is not everywhere defined, then as far as the textbook of Bruck (see refs), they talked about halfgroupoids. In $n$Lab, a [[groupoid]] is another structure (small category where all morphisms are isomorphisms). It is however coming from Brandt's groupoids, which were considered as sets with partially defined operations, equivalent to what we call connected groupoids. As Brandt groupoids took the primacy, the usual groupoids were newly named magma, by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]. In categorical universal algebra, magma usually denotes unital magma. Bourbaki coined some other names of common structures, including [[semigroup]] and [[distributive lattice]]. In choosing word magma, Bourbaki was lead by amorphous structure, as a _weakening_ of the common and strong notion of a group. There is actually a tradition to such terminology of weakenings for groups, to use terms suggesting loose matter: for example [[heap]] (earlier, and similar, flock) for a group with forgotten identity, wrack and nowdays rack for left distributive left quasigroup (coined by [[John Conway]], cf. verb wrack, and noun wreckage; compared to ruin, but also a pun on the similar spelling and sound in the name of his coauthor Wraith).

Books on binary structures are quite dominated with study of nonassociative ones, where quasigroups are the most prominent class (including one sided versions, like left quasigroups and their subclasses, say left [[rack]]s).

## Quasigroups

Some consider the concept of quasigroup to be an example of [[centipede mathematics]] and uninteresting due to their lack of deep applications (the latter opinion on quasigroups and loops is however getting obsolete in view of modern examples and applications).  For example, one mathematician has written:

>The meeting was dominated by algebraic loop theory.  It occured to me that as a way to use your intellectual resources this was very akin in significance to doing a difficult sudoku, a thought that was made very ironic when one speaker started making loops out of what were essentially sudoku squares.

Nonetheless it can be instructive to ponder these concepts, and there are some nontrivial examples.
