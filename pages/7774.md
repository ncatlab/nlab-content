A *diagonalizable group scheme* $G$ over a ring $k$ is a group scheme satisfying the following equivalent conditions:

1. $G$ is the [[Cartier duality|Cartier dual]] of a [[constant sheaf|constant group scheme]].

1. $O(G)=hom(G,O_k)$ is a [[character|character group]] i.e. $O(G)$ is generated by morphisms $G\to \mu_k$ into the [[multiplicative group scheme]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $H$ be a constant group scheme. Let $G=D(H)$ be its Cartier dual. By definition we have $D(H)(R)=hom(H\otimes_R, \mu_R)$
