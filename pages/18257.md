## Definition

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is called _metrisable_ if there exists the stucture of a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ on the underlying set, such that $\tau$ is the corresponding [[metric topology]].

## Properties

Metrizable spaces enjoy a number of separation properties: they are [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], [[regular space|regular]], and even [[normal space|normal]]. They are also [[paracompact space|paracompact]]. 

Metrizable spaces are closed under topological [[coproducts]] and of course [[subspaces]] (and therefore [[equalizers]]); they are closed under [[countable family|countable]] [[products]] but not general products (for instance, a product of uncountably many copies of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is not a normal space). 


## Metrisability theorem

Fundamental early work in point-set topology established a number of [[metrization theorem|metrization theorems]], i.e., theorems which give sufficient conditions for a space to be metrisable. One of the more useful theorems is [[Urysohn]] [[Urysohn metrization theorem |metrization theorem]]: 
A [[separation axiom|regular, Hausdorff]], and [[second-countable space]] is metrisable. 
So, for instance, a compact Hausdorff space that is second-countable is metrisable. Other metrization theorems are: 

* Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem 

* Bing metrization theorem 

* Moore metrization theorem
