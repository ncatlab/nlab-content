In [[set theory]], a (Gödel) __constructible set__ is any set in [[constructible universe]], see there. One can generalize to constructible elements in more general [[Boolean lattice]]s. 

For example, in [[general topology]], given a [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$, a __constructible subset__ of $X$, sometimes (when $(X,\tau)$ is fixed) often simply referred as a constructible set, is an element of the smallest Boolean algebra of sets containing the topology $\tau$; the constructible sets are precisely the finite unions of locally closed sets. 

In the case of [[theory]] ACF of algebraically closed fields, for every model $K$, the constructible sets in affine space $K^n$ are precisely the [[definable set]]s for the language of fields.

Cf. also the concept of a constructible sheaf. 

The constructible sets are one of the central notions in descriptive set theory.
