## Idea

 _Constructible sets_ are one of the central notions in 
[[descriptive set theory]].

## Definition

In [[set theory]], a (Gödel) __constructible set__ is any set in a [[constructible universe]], see there. 

One can generalize to constructible elements in more general [[Boolean lattices]]. 

## Examples

* In [[general topology]], given a [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$, a __constructible subset__ of $X$, sometimes (when $(X,\tau)$ is fixed) often simply referred as a constructible set, is an element of the smallest Boolean algebra of sets containing the topology $\tau$; the constructible sets are precisely the finite unions of locally closed sets. 

* In the case of [[theory]] ACF of [[algebraically closed fields]], for every [[model]] $K$, the constructible sets in the [[affine space]] $K^n$ are precisely the [[definable sets]] for the [[language in model theory|language]] of [[fields]].
