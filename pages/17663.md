## Idea

[[4d supergravity]] is often formulated as a theory of [[gravity]] coupled to scalar-[[vector multiplets]] only, i.e. 1-form [[gauge fields]]. On the other hand, when the theory is thought of as obtained by [[KK-compactification]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]], then it naturally contains also 2-form fields ([[tensor multiplets]]), i.e. [[higher gauge fields]]. If these are massless, then in 4-dimensions they may be dualized (via [[Hodge duality]] of their [[field strengths]]) to scalars, which is why they often do not explicitly appear in the formulation. However, when they are massive, which happens for instance when the higher dimensional theory is reduced via a [[flux compactification]], then such dualization does not apply (at least not so directly) and the 2-form [[higher gauge fields]] need to be made explicit (see the introduction of [Gunyadin-McReynolds-Zagerman 05](#GunyadinMcReynoldsZagerman05)).

In the [[D'Auria-Fr√© formulation of supergravity]] such higher form field contributions are reflected by [[L-infinity algebra]] [[L-infinity extensions|extensions]] of the [[super Minkowski spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebra]] (traditionally displayed in terms of dual [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]], called "FDA"s in the supergravity literature).

For the 2-form fields of $N = 2$ [[4d supergravity]] this yields a [[Lie 2-algebra]] ([Andrianopoli-D'Auria-Sommovigo 07 (4.1)-(4.7)](#AndrianopoliDAuriaSommovigo07)), which hence might be called the "4d supergravity Lie 2-algebra". In fact, including the [[moduli]] fields, this is a [[L-infinity algebroid|Lie 2-algebroid]] ([Andrianopoli-D'Auria-Sommovigo 07 (4.8)-(4.9)](#AndrianopoliDAuriaSommovigo07)). See also ([AAST 11, (4.1)-(4.9)](#AAST11)).

This Lie 2-algebra is a non-abelian variant of the [[L-infinity extension]] classified by the 3-cocycle $\propto \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi \wedge e_a$ ([Andrianopoli-D'Auria-Sommovigo 07 (4.5)](#AndrianopoliDAuriaSommovigo07)), which is the [[WZW term]] for the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] in 4d (see the notation and conventions at _[[super-Minkowski spacetime]]_).

But the [[brane scan]] says that there is also a [[super 2-brane in 4d]] whose [[WZW-term]] is the 4-cocycle $\propto \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a b} \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b$. Accordingly there should also be a 4d supegravity [[Lie 3-algebra]]. This is left to "future investigations" in ([Andrianopoli-D'Auria-Sommovigo 07, p. 19](#AndrianopoliDAuriaSommovigo07)), but the relevant extension formula by the 4-cocycle is shown in ([Andrianopoli-D'Auria-Sommovigo 07 (2.24)](#AndrianopoliDAuriaSommovigo07))
