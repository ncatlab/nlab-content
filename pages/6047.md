## Definition

The _Nambu-Goto action_ is an [[action functional]] for [[sigma-model]]s with [[target space]] a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$: it is simply the induced [[volume]] functional

$$
  S_{NG} : (\Sigma \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} X) \mapsto \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g)
  \,,
$$

where $dvol(\gamma^* g)$ is the [[volume form]] of the pullback $\gamma^* g$ of the metric tensor from $X$ to $\Sigma$.

This is classically equivalent (...) to the [[Polyakov action]].

## Applications

The NG-action serves as the kinetic action functional for the [[relativistic particle]], the [[string]], and the corresponding higher dimensional [[sigma-model]]s.
