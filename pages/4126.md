## Idea

In quantum mechanics, the Kochen-Specker theorem, developed in 1967 by Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker, is a [[no-go theorem]] that places limits on the types of [[hidden variable theories]] that may be used to explain the apparent randomness of quantum mechanics in a causal way.  It is a complement to [[Bell's theorem]], developed by John Bell in 1964, and is related to [[Gleason's theorem]], developed in 1957 by Andrew Gleason (who incidentally is the person who communicated the original Kochen-Specker paper to the _Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics_.
