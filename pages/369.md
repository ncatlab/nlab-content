## Idea

Two [[morphisms]] in a category $C$ are __parallel__ if they have the same [[source]] and [[target]]. Equivalently a pair of __parallel morphisms__ in $C$ consists of an [[object]] $x$, and object $y$, and two morphisms $f, g: x \to y$.

$$
  \array{
    x
      &
      \underoverset
        {\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}}
        {\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}
        {}
      &
    y
  }
$$

This may be extended to a family of any number of morphisms, but the morphisms are always compared pairwise to see if they are parallel. Degenerate cases: a family of one parallel morphism is simply a morphism; a family of zero parallel morphisms is simply a pair of objects.

## Limits and colimits

The [[limit]] of a pair (or family) or morphisms is called their __[[equalizer]]__; the [[colimit]] is their __[[coequalizer]]__. (Of course, these do not always exist.)
