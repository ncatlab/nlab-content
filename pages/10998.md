## Idea

The term _compuational type theory_ is often used generally for [[intuitionistic type theory]], referring to its [[computation|computational]] content in view of the [[propositions-as-types]] and [[proofs-as-programs]] interpretation (e.g. [Scholarpedia](#Scholarpedia)). More specifically it is used for type theory with [[inductive types]] and even more  specifically ([Fairtlough-Mendler 02](#FairtloughMendler02)) for [[modal type theory]], specifically for [[type theory]] equipped with a [[monad (in computer science)]] (that preserves [[finite products]]), which exhibits a kind of computation.

The [[internal logic]] inside type theory equipped with a [[monad (in computer science)]] is also called _propositional lax logic_ ([Fairtlough Mendler 97](#FairtloughMendler97)) or _computational logic_.
