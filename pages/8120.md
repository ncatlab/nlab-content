## Idea

The concept of [[direct sum]] extends easily from [[vector spaces]] to [[topological vector spaces]]; we wish to extend it to [[Banach spaces]].

When taking the direct sum of two (or any [[finite set|finite number]]) of Banach spaces, the only question is which [[norm]] to use; and we have a choice, entirely analogous to the choice of norms to put on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^2$ (and its [[complexification|complexified]] variant $\mathbb{C}^2$): one for each [[extended real number]] $p \in [1, \infty]$.  (In fact, this is a special case, the direct sum of two copies of the [[line]] $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.)

For infinitely many summands (or in [[constructive mathematics]], any number which may not be finite in the strictest sense), the naïve direct sum is not [[complete space|complete]] under any of these norms, so we must complete it, getting different results for each $p$; this is analogous to the different [[sequence space]]s $l^p$.  (Again, this is a special case, a direct sum of infinitely many copies of the line.)

In accordance with the last analogy, we speak of $l^p$-direct sums.  In fact, even more variety is possible, corresponding to other possible norms on standard Banach spaces.

## Properties

If [[short map|short]] [[linear maps]] are taken as the [[morphisms]] in the category of Banach spaces, then the $l^1$-direct sum is the [[coproduct]], and the $l^\infty$-direct sum is the [[product]].

We can also consider the abstract concepts of [[direct sum]] and [[weak direct product]]; here again the $l^1$-direct sum is the direct sum, and the $l^\infty$-direct sum is the weak direct product.  (It is quite common for coproduct and direct sum to be the same, but weak direct product usually diverges from the product for infinitely many object.  That they match up here cruicially depends on [[complete space|completeness]].)
