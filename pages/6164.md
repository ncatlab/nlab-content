## Idea

Every [[spectrum]] $K$ is the coefficient object of a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology theory]] and dually of a _generalized homology_ theory. See at _[[generalized cohomology]]_ for more.

For $K = H R$ an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] this reduces to [[homology|ordinary homology]]
