## Idea

A _triangulated category_ is a [[category]] that behaves like the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]]. Indeed, most examples of triangulated categories that arise in practice appear this way, and in fact often from [[stable model categories]].

Therefore, all the structure and properties of a triangulated category is best understood as a 1-categorical shadow of the corresponding properties of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]], which are more natural and correct.  Triangulated categories are sometimes sufficient, and can be easier to work with since they are only 1-categorical rather than higher-categorical, but often one needs more information than is present in the triangulated category, usually relating to homotopy limits and colimits.  An intermediate notion, which contains a good deal of this information, is a [[stable derivator]] [[derivator]].

## Definition

A __triangulated category__ is 

* an [[additive category]];

* [[category with translation|with (additive) translation]];

* equipped with a collection of [[category with translation|triangles]] called __distinguished triangles__ (dts) 

* such that the following axioms hold

**TR0:** every triangle isomorphic to a distinguished triangle is itself a distinguished triangle;

**TR1:** the triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{Id_X}{\to} X \to 0 \to T X
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle;

**TR2:** for all $f : X \to Y$, there exists a distinguished triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \to Z \to TX
  \,;
$$

**TR3:** a triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle precisely if 

$$
  Y \stackrel{-g}{\to} Z \stackrel{-h}{\to} T X \stackrel{-T(f)}{\to} T Y
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle;

**TR4:** given two distinguished triangles 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

and 

$$X' \stackrel{f'}{\to} Y' \stackrel{g'}{\to} Z' \stackrel{h'}{\to} T X'$$ 

and given morphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in

$$\array{
  X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  \\
  \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
  \\
  X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'  
}$$

there exists a morphism $\gamma : Z \to Z'$ 
extending this to a morphism of distinguished triangles in that
the diagram 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z
    &\stackrel{h}{\to}& T X
    \\
    \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
    && \downarrow^{\exists \gamma}
    && \downarrow^{T(\alpha)}
    \\
    X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'
    &\stackrel{g'}{\to}& Z'
    &\stackrel{h'}{\to}& T X'
}
$$

commutes;

**TR5:** given three distinguished triangles of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
    \stackrel{h}{\to} Y/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\\
& Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{k}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{}{\to} T Y
\\
& X \stackrel{g \circ f}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{l}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\end{aligned}
$$ 

there exists a distinguished triangle

$$
Y/X \stackrel{u}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{v}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{w}{\to} T (Y/X)
$$

such that the following big diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X 
    &&\stackrel{g \circ f}{\to}&& 
    Z
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    Z/Y
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    T (Y/X)
    \\
    & 
    {}_{f}\searrow
    && 
    \nearrow_{g}
    &&
    \searrow^{l}
    &&
    \nearrow_{v} 
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(h)}
    \\
    &&
    Y
    &&&&
    Z/X
    &&&&
    T Y
    \\
    &&&
    \searrow^{h}
    &&
    \nearrow_{u}
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(f)}
    \\
    &&&&
    Y/X
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&&
    T X
  }
$$

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: This classical definition is actually redundant; TR4 and one direction of TR3 follow from the remaining axioms.  See J.P. May, _The additivity of traces in triangulated categories_, [pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/PAPERS/AddJan01.pdf).

## Remarks

* In the context of triangulated categories the translation functor $T : C \to C$ is often called the **suspension functor** and denoted $(-)[1] : X \mapsto X[1]$ (in an algebraic context) or $S$ or $\Sigma$ (in a topological context).  However unlike "translation functor", suspension functor is also the term used when the invertibility is not assumed, cf. [[suspended category]].

* If $(f,g,h)$ is a distinguished triangle, then $(f,g,-h)$ is not generally distinguished, although it is "exact" (induces [[long exact sequences]] in [[homology]] and [[cohomology]]).  However, $(f,-g,-h)$ *is* always distinguished, since it is isomorphic to $(f,g,h)$:
  $$ \array{ X & \xrightarrow{f} & Y & \xrightarrow{g} & Z & \xrightarrow{h} & T X\\
    ^{id}\downarrow && ^{id} \downarrow && ^{-1} \downarrow && \downarrow^{id}\\
    X & \xrightarrow{f} & Y & \xrightarrow{-g} & Z & \xrightarrow{-h} & T X}$$

## Examples

* The [[homotopy category]] of [[chain complexes]] in an [[abelian category]] (the category of chain complexes modulo [[chain homotopy]]) is a triangulated category: the translation functor is the shift functor on [[chain complexes]] and the distinguished triangles are those coming from the [[mapping cone]] construction $X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \to Cone(f) \to T X$.

* The [[stable homotopy category]] (the homotopy category of [[spectrum|spectra]]) is a triangulated category.  This is also true for parametrized, equivariant, etc. spectra.

* The stable category of a [[Quillen exact category]] is [[suspended category]] as exhibited by [[Bernhard Keller]]. If the exact category is Frobenius, i.e. has enough injectives and enough projective and these two classes coincide, then the suspension of the stable category is in fact invertible, hence the stable category is triangulated. A triangulated category equivalent to a triangulated categories is said to be an [[algebraic triangulated category]]. 

* As mentioned before, the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] is a triangulated category.  Slightly more generally, this applies also to a [[stable derivator]], and slightly less generally, it applies to a [[stable model category]].  This includes both the preceeding examples.

* The [[localization]] $C/N$ of any triangulated category $C$ at a [[null system]] $N \hookrightarrow C$, i.e. the localization using the [[calculus of fractions]] given by the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ such that there exists distinguished triangles $X \to Y \to Z \to T X$ with $Z$ an object of a [[null system]], is still naturally a triangulated category, with the distinguished triangles being the triangles isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle under $Q : C \to C/N$.

  * In particular, therefore, the [[derived category]] of any [[abelian category]] is a triangulated category, since it is the localization of the homotopy category at the null system of acyclic complexes.  This example is also the homotopy category of a stable $(\infty,1)$-category, and usually of a stable model category.
