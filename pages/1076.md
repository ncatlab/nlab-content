#Idea#

A _triangulated category_ is a [[category]] that behaves like the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]]. Indeed, most examples of triangulated categories that arise in practice appear this way. 

Therefore, all the structure and properties of a triangulated category is best understood as a 1-categorical shadow of the corresponding properties of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]], which are in fact simpler and more natural.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: as far as I overheard, the concept of _d&eacute;rivateurs_ is an attempt to enhance the axioms of a triangulated category to get closer to the "true answer" (= stable $(\infty,1)$-category). Maybe somebody who knows more can make an educated comment on the relation to _d&eacute;rivateurs_ here.

#Definition#

A **triangulated category** is 

* an [[additive category]];

* [[category with translation|with translation]];

* equipped with a collection of [[category with translation|triangles]] called **distinguished triangles** (dts) 

* such that the following axioms hold

**TR0:** every triangle isomorphic to a dt is itself a dt;

**TR1:** the triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{Id_X}{\to} X \to 0 \to T X
$$ 

is a dt;

**TR2:** for all $f : X \to Y$, there exists a dt 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \to Z \to TX
  \,;
$$

**TR3:** a triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

is a dt precisely if 

$$
  Y \stackrel{-g}{\to} Z \stackrel{-h}{\to} T X \stackrel{-F(f)}{\to} T Y
$$ 

is a dt;

**TR4:** given two dts 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

and 

$$X' \stackrel{f'}{\to} Y' \stackrel{g'}{\to} Z' \stackrel{h'}{\to} T X'$$ 

and given morphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in

$$\array{
  X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  \\
  \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
  \\
  X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'  
}$$

there exists a morphism $\gamma : Z \to Z'$ 
extending this to a morphism of dts in that
the diagram 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z
    &\stackrel{h}{\to}& T X
    \\
    \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
    && \downarrow^{\exists \gamma}
    && \downarrow^{T(\alpha)}
    \\
    X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'
    &\stackrel{g'}{\to}& Z'
    &\stackrel{h'}{\to}& T X'
}
$$

commutes;

**TR5:** given three distinguished triangles of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
    \stackrel{h}{\to} Y/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\\
& Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{k}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{}{\to} T Y
\\
& X \stackrel{g \circ f}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{l}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\end{aligned}
$$ 

there exists a dt

$$
Y/X \stackrel{u}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{v}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{w}{\to} T (Y/X)
$$

such that the following big diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X 
    &&\stackrel{g \circ f}{\to}&& 
    Z
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    Z/Y
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    T (Y/X)
    \\
    & 
    {}_{f}\searrow
    && 
    \nearrow_{g}
    &&
    \searrow^{l}
    &&
    \nearrow_{v} 
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(h)}
    \\
    &&
    Y
    &&&&
    Z/X
    &&&&
    T Y
    \\
    &&&
    \searrow^{h}
    &&
    \nearrow_{u}
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(f)}
    \\
    &&&&
    Y/X
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&&
    T X
  }
$$

#Remarks#

* In the context of triangulated categories the translation functor $T : C \to C$ is often called the **suspension functor** and usually denoted $(-)[1] : X \mapsto X[1]$.

#Examples#

* The [[category of chain complexes]] in an [[additive category]] is a triangulated category: the translation functor is the shift functor on [[chain complex]]es and the distinguished triangles are those coming from the [[mapping cone]] construction $X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \to Cone(f) \to T X$.

* The [[localization]] $C/N$ of any triangulated category $C$ at a [[null system]] $N \hookrightarrow C$, i.e. the localization at the [[multiplicative system]] given by the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ such that there exists dts $X \to Y \to Z \to T X$ with $Z$ an object of a [[null system]], is still naturally a triangulated category, with the dts being the triangles isomorphic to an image of a dt under $Q : C \to C/N$.

  * In particular therefore the [[derived category]] of any [[abelian category]] is a triangulated category.

* As mentioned before, the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] is a triangulated category.

  * Therefore in particular the category of [[spectrum|spectra]] is a triangulated category.
