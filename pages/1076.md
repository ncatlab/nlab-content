## Idea

Triangulated categories were introduced by [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] under the supervision of [[Grothendieck]], motivated by the triangulated structure on [[derived categories]].

A _triangulated category_ is a [[category]] equipped with a notion of [[suspension objects]]/[[loop space objects]] for all of its objects such that in terms of these every [[morphism]] fits into a sequence that behaves like a [[homotopy fiber sequence]].

More precisely, a _triangulated category_ is a [[category]] that behaves like the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]. Indeed, most examples of triangulated categories that arise in practice appear this way, and in fact often from [[stable model categories]]. Notice that the definition of _[[stable (∞,1)-category]]_ is very simple and much simpler than the definition of triangulated category, def. \ref{TriangulatedCategory} below.

Therefore, all the structure and properties of a triangulated category is best understood as a 1-categorical shadow (the _[[decategorification]]_) of the corresponding properties of [[stable (∞,1)-categories]].  

A central class of examples of triangulated categories are the [[derived categories]] $D(\mathcal{A})$ of [[abelian categories]] $\mathcal{A}$. These are the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy categories]] of the [[(∞,1)-categories of chain complexes]] in $\mathcal{A}$.

Triangulated categories are sufficient for some purposes, and can be easier to work with than the [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] that they come from, but -- as with every [[quotient]] construction -- often one needs more information than is present in the triangulated category, especially  concerning the computation of [[homotopy limits]] and [[homotopy colimits]]: the ordinary [[limits]] and [[colimits]] and other [[universal constructions]] in a triangulated category generally have no useful interpretation.

Accordingly, there is a series on notions that refine that of a triangulated category, approximating more and more of the full structure of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]:

* triangulated category

* [[pretriangulated dg-category]]

* [[enhanced triangulated category]]

* [[stable derivator]]

* [[stable (∞,1)-category]]


## Definition

The traditional definition of _triangulated category_ is the following. But see remark \ref{RedundancyInDefinition} below.

+-- {: .num_defn #TriangulatedCategory}
###### Definition

A __triangulated category__ is 

* an [[additive category]];

* [[category with translation|with (additive) translation]];

* equipped with a collection of [[category with translation|triangles]] called __[[distinguished triangles]]__ (dts) 

* such that the following axioms hold

**TR0:** every triangle isomorphic to a distinguished triangle is itself a distinguished triangle;

**TR1:** the triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{Id_X}{\to} X \to 0 \to T X
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle;

**TR2:** for all $f : X \to Y$, there exists a distinguished triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \to Z \to TX
  \,;
$$

**TR3:** a triangle 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle precisely if 

$$
  Y \stackrel{-g}{\to} Z \stackrel{-h}{\to} T X \stackrel{-T(f)}{\to} T Y
$$ 

is a distinguished triangle;

**TR4:** given two distinguished triangles 

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z \stackrel{h}{\to} T X
$$ 

and 

$$X' \stackrel{f'}{\to} Y' \stackrel{g'}{\to} Z' \stackrel{h'}{\to} T X'$$ 

and given morphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in

$$\array{
  X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  \\
  \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
  \\
  X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'  
}$$

there exists a morphism $\gamma : Z \to Z'$ 
extending this to a morphism of distinguished triangles in that
the diagram 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z
    &\stackrel{h}{\to}& T X
    \\
    \downarrow^\alpha && \downarrow^\beta
    && \downarrow^{\exists \gamma}
    && \downarrow^{T(\alpha)}
    \\
    X' &\stackrel{f'}{\to}& Y'
    &\stackrel{g'}{\to}& Z'
    &\stackrel{h'}{\to}& T X'
}
$$

commutes;

**TR5:** given three distinguished triangles of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
    \stackrel{h}{\to} Y/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\\
& Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{k}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{}{\to} T Y
\\
& X \stackrel{g \circ f}{\to} Z
    \stackrel{l}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{}{\to} T X
\end{aligned}
$$ 

there exists a distinguished triangle

$$
Y/X \stackrel{u}{\to} Z/X
    \stackrel{v}{\to} Z/Y
    \stackrel{w}{\to} T (Y/X)
$$

such that the following big diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X 
    &&\stackrel{g \circ f}{\to}&& 
    Z
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    Z/Y
    &&\stackrel{k}{\to}&& 
    T (Y/X)
    \\
    & 
    {}_{f}\searrow
    && 
    \nearrow_{g}
    &&
    \searrow^{l}
    &&
    \nearrow_{v} 
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(h)}
    \\
    &&
    Y
    &&&&
    Z/X
    &&&&
    T Y
    \\
    &&&
    \searrow^{h}
    &&
    \nearrow_{u}
    &&
    \searrow^{}
    &&
    \nearrow_{T(f)}
    \\
    &&&&
    Y/X
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&&
    T X
  }
$$

###### Remark

This classical definition is actually redundant; TR4 and one direction of TR3 follow from the remaining axioms.  See ([May](#May)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the context of triangulated categories the translation functor $T : C \to C$ is often called the **suspension functor** and denoted $(-)[1] : X \mapsto X[1]$ (in an algebraic context) or $S$ or $\Sigma$ (in a topological context).  However unlike "translation functor", suspension functor is also the term used when the invertibility is not assumed, cf. [[suspended category]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $(f,g,h)$ is a [[distinguished triangle]], then $(f,g,-h)$ is not generally distinguished, although it is "exact" (induces [[long exact sequences]] in [[homology]] and [[cohomology]]).  However, $(f,-g,-h)$ *is* always distinguished, since it is isomorphic to $(f,g,h)$:
  $$ \array{ X & \xrightarrow{f} & Y & \xrightarrow{g} & Z & \xrightarrow{h} & T X\\
    ^{id}\downarrow && ^{id} \downarrow && ^{-1} \downarrow && \downarrow^{id}\\
    X & \xrightarrow{f} & Y & \xrightarrow{-g} & Z & \xrightarrow{-h} & T X}$$

## Examples

* The [[homotopy category of chain complexes]] $K(\mathcal{A})$ in an [[abelian category]] (the category of chain complexes modulo [[chain homotopy]]) is a triangulated category: the translation functor is the [[suspension of chain complexes]] and the distinguished triangles are those coming from the [[mapping cone]] construction $X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \to Cone(f) \to T X$ in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$.

* The [[stable homotopy category]] (the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]] of the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]]) is a triangulated category.  This is also true for [[parameterized spectra|parametrized]], [[equivariant spectra|equivariant]], etc. spectra.

* The stable category of a [[Quillen exact category]] is [[suspended category]] as exhibited by [[Bernhard Keller]]. If the exact category is Frobenius, i.e. has enough injectives and enough projective and these two classes coincide, then the suspension of the stable category is in fact invertible, hence the stable category is triangulated. A triangulated category equivalent to a triangulated categories is said to be an [[algebraic triangulated category]]. 

* As mentioned before, the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] is a triangulated category.  Slightly more generally, this applies also to a [[stable derivator]], and slightly less generally, it applies to a [[stable model category]].  This includes both the preceding examples.

* The [[localization]] $C/N$ of any triangulated category $C$ at a [[null system]] $N \hookrightarrow C$, i.e. the localization using the [[calculus of fractions]] given by the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ such that there exists distinguished triangles $X \to Y \to Z \to T X$ with $Z$ an object of a [[null system]], is still naturally a triangulated category, with the distinguished triangles being the triangles isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle under $Q : C \to C/N$.

  * In particular, therefore, the [[derived category]] of any [[abelian category]] is a triangulated category, since it is the localization of the homotopy category at the null system of acyclic complexes.  This example is also the homotopy category of a stable $(\infty,1)$-category, and usually of a stable model category.
