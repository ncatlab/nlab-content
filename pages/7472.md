## Idea

In the context of [[higher category theory]] / [[(n,r)-categories]], a [[poset]] is equivalently regarded as a [[(0,1)-category]]. 

$(0,1)$-categories play a major role in [[logic]], where their objects are interpreted as [[propositions]], their morphisms as [[implications]] and  [[limits]]/[[products]] and [[colimits]]/[[coproducts]] as [[logical conjunctions]] _[[and]]_ and _[[or]]_, respectively.

[[Stone duality|Dually]], $(0,1)$-categories play a major role in [[topology]], where they are interpreted as [[categories of open subsets]] of a [[topological spaces]], or, more generally, of [[locales]].

Clearly, much of [[category theory]] simplifies drastically when restricted to $(0,1)$-categories, but it is often most useful to make the parallel explicit.
