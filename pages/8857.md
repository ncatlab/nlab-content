## Idea

__Cohomological induction__ is a [[derived functor]] version of [[induction functors]] in [[representation theory]]. As the elements in induced representations correspond to [[sections]] of certain equivariant bundles or sheaves, similarly the cohomological induction functors could be interpreted as higher cohomologies of certain [[equivariant sheaves]]. 

In specific contexts, like real Lie groups, there are specifical versions like Zuckerman induction functors; they are defined algebraically.
