#Whitehead problem#


The following question is called the **Whitehead problem**

Every [[free abelian group]] $A$ satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Is, conversely, every abelian group $A$ that satisfies $Ext^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ a free abelian group?

When formalizing [[group theory]] within [[ETCS]] as a [[set theory]], then this is question is undecidable.  (It is still undecidable in [[ZFC]], equivalently in ETCS + Collection.)  In some models it is true, while other models have counterexamples.
