According to definition 1.21 and remark 1.23 in

* [[Clark Barwick]] , _On left and right model categories and left and right Bousfield localization_ ([pdf](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~clarkbar/complete.pdf))

a [[model category]] is called **tractable** if it is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]] and it has sets $I$ and $J$ of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, respectively, whose sources are all [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]].
