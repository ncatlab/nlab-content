## Idea

Traditional [[prequantum geometry]] is the [[differential geometry]] of [[smooth manifolds]] which are equipped with a _[[twisted cohomology|twist]]_   in the form of a [[circle group]]-[[principal bundle]] and a circle-[[principal connection]].
In the context of _[[geometric quantization]]_ of [[symplectic manifolds]] these arise as _[[prequantum bundles]]_. Equivalently, prequantum geometry is the _[[contact geometry]]_ of the  total spaces of these bundles, equipped with their [[Ehresmann connection]] [[differential 1-form]] and  thought of as _[[regular contact manifolds]]_.  Prequantum geometry notably studies the [[automorphisms]] of [[prequantum bundles]] covering [[diffeomorphisms]] of the base
-- the _[[prequantum operators]]_ or _[[contactomorphisms]]_ -- and the [[action]] of these on the space of [[sections]] of the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[line bundle]] -- the _[[prequantum states]]_. This is an intermediate step in the genuine _[[geometric quantization]]_ of the [[curvature]] [[differential 2-form]] of these bundles,
which is obtained by "dividing the above data in half" ([[polarization]]), important for instance in the the _[[orbit method]]_.

But prequantum geometry is of interest in its own right. 
For instance the above automorphism group naturally provides the 
[[Lie integration]] of the [[Poisson bracket]] [[Lie algebra]] of the underlying [[symplectic manifold]], together with the canonical
injection into the [[group of bisections]] of the [[Lie integration]] of the  _[[Atiyah Lie algebroid]]_ which is associated with the given circle bundle, all of which are fundamental objects of interest in the study of [[line bundles]] over [[manifolds]].
