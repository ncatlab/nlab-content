Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$1$-category__ is an $\infty$-category such that every $2$-morphism is an [[equivalence]] and all [[parallel pairs]] of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 2$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $1$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $1$-morphisms are equivalent. If you rephrase equivalence of $1$-morphisms as [[equality]], which gives the same result up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], then all that is left in this definition is a [[category]].  Thus one may also say that a __$1$-category__ is simply a category.

The point of all this is simply to fill in the general concept of $n$-[[n-category|category]]; nobody thinks of $1$-categories as a concept in their own right except simply as categories.  Compare $1$-[[1-groupoid|groupoid]] and $1$-[[1-poset|poset]], which are defined on the same basis.
