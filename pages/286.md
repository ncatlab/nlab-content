## Idea

In [[category theory]], a concept is (half-jokingly) said to be _evil_ if it involves equations between [[object|objects]], or more generally if it distinguishes between [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] objects.  More precisely:

* A property of categories is _non-evil_ if it when it holds for a [[category]] $C$, it also holds for any category $C'$ that is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $C$.

* A property of functors is _non-evil_ if when holds for a [[functor]] $F$, it also holds for any functor $F'$ that is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to $F$.

By rigorously avoiding equations between objects, we can ensure that the properties we define are non-evil.  (This should be made more precise, to become a theorem.)

The ideas here generalize in many directions.  For example not only properties, but also constructions involving categories and functors, can be evil or non-evil.  The idea also generalizes to $n$-categories and to objects, morphisms etc. [[internalization|internal]] to $n$-categories.


## General definition

If $X$ is an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]], then a property $P$ of objects of $X$ is __non-evil__ if, whenever $P(a)$ holds for an object $a$ of $X$ and $b$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] (as an object of $X$) to $a$, then $P(b)$ holds. Alternatively, an operation $f$ from objects of $X$ to objects of (another $\infty$-groupoid) $Y$ is __non-evil__ if, whenever $a$ and $b$ are equivalent objects of $X$, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are equivalent (as objects of $Y$).

(Note that everything is an object of some $\infty$-groupoid. For example, a $2$-morphism in some random $5$-category is an object of a hom-$3$-category, which has an [[core|underlying]] $3$-groupoid, which is a special kind of $\infty$-groupoid. For some purposes, this $2$-morphism may instead need to be seen as an object in a $2$-arrow $5$-category, which has an underlying $\infty$-groupoid as well; exactly which $\infty$-groupoid is relevant depends on the [[context]]. Also note that we really do need $\infty$-groupoids here, rather than $\infty$-categories, since dualities are not evil.)

The operation-version of evil gives the property-version if you think of a property as an operation taking values in the $\infty$-groupoid (in fact a $0$-groupoid, or [[set]]) of [[truth value|truth values]]. (The property-version also gives the operation-version, although that is a little more involved.) An operation will be non-evil if it is given (as the object-operation) by a [[functor]] (‘$\infty$-functor’, if you prefer). A property is non-evil precisely iff it\'s a functor to the $\infty$-groupoid of truth values.

This definition should be the conclusion of a theorem that using certain language (including avoiding equations between objects of a category) makes it impossible to say anything evil. [[Michael Makkai]] works on such a language, [[FOLDS]] ('first-order logic with dependent sorts'), which does not include an axiomatic notion of [[equality]] at all. This pertains to the [[foundations|mathematical foundations of category theory]]. To learn more, see his paper _[First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts, with Applications to Category Theory](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/)_.


## Examples

The most common source of evil is a statement that two [[objects]] of a given category are [[equality|equal]].  One should instead say that they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] and then (usually) impose some [[coherence relation]] on the relevant family of isomorphisms.  But of course, this is more complicated!

It is not evil to state that two [[morphisms]] are equal, given a common [[source]] and [[target]]; this is because a [[hom-set]] is a [[set]], where equality is meaningful.  However, it is evil to state that two morphisms are equal if the source and target are *not* given, because this includes the claim that their sources (which are objects) are equal, and similarly for the targets.

It is evil to state that two morphisms in a $2$-[[2-category|category]] are equal, because these morphisms are objects in a [[hom-category]], but it\'s not evil to state that that two $2$-moprhisms are equal, given a common source and target.  And so on.  In an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], *every* claim of equality is evil.

Defining higher categorial structures using such evil equalities tends to lead to *strict* concepts; avoiding them and imposing coherence relations leads to *weak* concepts.  Sometimes there is a [[coherence theorem]] showing that every weak concept can be strictified, which justifies using equality as a figure of speech.  See [[Gray-category]] and [[model category]] for examples of this in action.


## Discussion

There's been a lot of discussion of this on the $n$-Category Caf&eacute; --- someone find it and cite it!

Comment: It seems that at some level you can't avoid equality, at least if you want to completely formalise things (say, in a proof assistant). For example, in the definition of "category" itself (on which the definitions of isomorphism and $\infty$-groupoid seem to depend), we say that $g \circ f$ is defined iff $\dom g = \cod f$.

Now if you start your theorem with "let $a,b,c$ be objects of $C$ and let $g : b \to c$,$f: a \to b$ be morphisms", then there's no problem. But what if you need to compose morphisms whose dom/cod aren't definitionally/syntactically equal? I suppose that at this point it depends on which foundations you use.

Reply:  Yes, it can depend on the foundations.  [[FOLDS]] is a foundation specifically designed to avoid evil, and higher category theory has been formulated in it (by [[Michael Makkai]], who invented both FOLDS and a multitopic definition of higher categories to go with it).  More generally, the style of terminology that you gave comes naturally to a development of (higher) category theory in a foundation based on dependent [[type theory]].

Even in your first example, the quesion of whether we can compose $g \circ f$, we can avoid evil if we try.  Naïvely, we can compose them if and only if $\dom g = \cod f$; composability is a property of the pair ---but an evil property.  Less evilly, we make composability a *structure* on the pair; we can compose them along any isomorphism between $\dom g$ and $\cod f$.  So as usual in category theory, we don\'t ask whether these objects are equal but instead how they might be isomorphic.

Of course, if $f$ and $g$ are given as $g: b \to c$ and $f: a \to b$, then we can compose them along the identity morphism of $b$; this is the usual notion of compoisition in that case.  It is only when $f$ and $g$ are not given to us in such a way that we have to talk about composing along an arbitrary (possibly nonexistent, certainly not likely to exist uniquely) isomorphism.

Can you say everything that you want to say about (higher) categories while avoiding evil throughout?  That will always be an open question, as people think of new things to say about them.  But I think that it is a fruiful attitude to take that one should try.  ---[[Toby Bartels]]
