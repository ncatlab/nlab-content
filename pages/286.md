## Idea

In [[category theory]], a concept is (half-jokingly) said to be _evil_ if it involves equations between [[object|objects]], or more generally if it distinguishes between [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] objects.  More precisely:

* A property of categories is _non-evil_ if it when it holds for a [[category]] $C$, it also holds for any category $C'$ that is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $C$.

* A property of functors is _non-evil_ if when holds for a [[functor]] $F$, it also holds for any functor $F'$ that is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to $F$.

By rigorously avoiding equations between objects, we can ensure that the properties we define are non-evil.  (This should be made more precise, to become a theorem.)

The ideas here generalize in many directions.  For example not only properties, but also constructions involving categories and functors, can be evil or non-evil.  The idea also generalizes to $n$-categories and to objects, morphisms etc. [[internalization|internal]] to $n$-categories.


## General definition

If $X$ is an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]], then a property $P$ of objects of $X$ is __non-evil__ if, whenever $P(a)$ holds for an object $a$ of $X$ and $b$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] (as an object of $X$) to $a$, then $P(b)$ holds. Alternatively, an operation $f$ from objects of $X$ to objects of (another $\infty$-groupoid) $Y$ is __non-evil__ if, whenever $a$ and $b$ are equivalent objects of $X$, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are equivalent (as objects of $Y$).

(Note that everything is an object of some $\infty$-groupoid. For example, a $2$-morphism in some random $5$-category is an object of a hom-$3$-category, which has an [[core|underlying]] $3$-groupoid, which is a special kind of $\infty$-groupoid. For some purposes, this $2$-morphism may instead need to be seen as an object in a $2$-arrow $5$-category, which has an underlying $\infty$-groupoid as well; exactly which $\infty$-groupoid is relevant depends on the [[context]]. Also note that we really do need $\infty$-groupoids here, rather than $\infty$-categories, since dualities are not evil.)

The operation-version of evil gives the property-version if you think of a property as an operation taking values in the $\infty$-groupoid (in fact a $0$-groupoid, or [[set]]) of [[truth value|truth values]]. (The property-version also gives the operation-version, although that is a little more involved.) An operation will be non-evil if it is given (as the object-operation) by a [[functor]] (‘$\infty$-functor’, if you prefer). A property is non-evil precisely iff it\'s a functor to the $\infty$-groupoid of truth values.

This definition should be the conclusion of a theorem that using certain language (including avoiding equations between objects of a category) makes it impossible to say anything evil. [[Michael Makkai]] works on such a language, [[FOLDS]] ('first-order logic with dependent sorts'), which does not include an axiomatic notion of [[equality]] at all. This pertains to the [[foundations|mathematical foundations of category theory]]. To learn more, see his paper _[First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts, with Applications to Category Theory](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/)_.


## Examples

The most common source of evil is a statement that two [[objects]] of a given category are [[equality|equal]].  One should instead say that they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] and then (usually) impose some [[coherence relation]] on the relevant family of isomorphisms.  But of course, this is more complicated!

It is not evil to state that two [[morphisms]] are equal, given a common [[source]] and [[target]]; this is because a [[hom-set]] is a [[set]], where equality is meaningful.  However, it is evil to state that two morphisms are equal if the source and target are *not* given, because this includes the claim that their sources (which are objects) are equal, and similarly for the targets.

It is evil to state that two morphisms in a $2$-[[2-category|category]] are equal, because these morphisms are objects in a [[hom-category]], but it\'s not evil to state that that two $2$-moprhisms are equal, given a common source and target.  And so on.  In an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], *every* claim of equality is evil.

Defining higher categorial structures using such evil equalities tends to lead to *strict* concepts; avoiding them and imposing coherence relations leads to *weak* concepts.  Sometimes there is a [[coherence theorem]] showing that every weak concept can be strictified, which justifies using equality as a figure of speech.  See [[Gray-category]] and [[model category]] for examples of this in action.


## Discussion

There's been a lot of discussion of this on the $n$-Category Caf&eacute; --- someone find it and cite it!

Comment: It seems that at some level you can't avoid equality, at least if you want to completely formalise things (say, in a proof assistant). For example, in the definition of "category" itself (on which the definitions of isomorphism and $\infty$-groupoid seem to depend), we say that $g \circ f$ is defined iff $\dom g = \cod f$.

Now if you start your theorem with "let $a,b,c$ be objects of $C$ and let $g : b \to c$,$f: a \to b$ be morphisms", then there's no problem. But what if you need to compose morphisms whose dom/cod aren't definitionally/syntactically equal? I suppose that at this point it depends on which foundations you use.

Reply:  Yes, it can depend on the foundations.  [[FOLDS]] is a foundation specifically designed to avoid evil, and higher category theory has been formulated in it (by [[Michael Makkai]], who invented both FOLDS and a multitopic definition of higher categories to go with it).  More generally, the style of terminology that you gave comes naturally to a development of (higher) category theory in a foundation based on dependent [[type theory]].

Even in your first example, the quesion of whether we can compose $g \circ f$, we can avoid evil if we try.  Naïvely, we can compose them if and only if $\dom g = \cod f$; composability is a property of the pair ---but an evil property.  Less evilly, we make composability a *structure* on the pair; we can compose them along any isomorphism between $\dom g$ and $\cod f$.  So as usual in category theory, we don\'t ask whether these objects are equal but instead how they might be isomorphic.

Of course, if $f$ and $g$ are given as $g: b \to c$ and $f: a \to b$, then we can compose them along the identity morphism of $b$; this is the usual notion of compoisition in that case.  It is only when $f$ and $g$ are not given to us in such a way that we have to talk about composing along an arbitrary (possibly nonexistent, certainly not likely to exist uniquely) isomorphism.

Can you say everything that you want to say about (higher) categories while avoiding evil throughout?  That will always be an open question, as people think of new things to say about them.  But I think that it is a fruiful attitude to take that one should try.  ---[[Toby Bartels]]

[[Mike Shulman]]: I'm not convinced by "composing along isomorphisms," because what does it mean for an isomorphism $h$ to be "between" $\dom g$ and $\cod f$?  It means that $\dom h = \cod f$ and $\cod h = \dom g$.

_Toby_:  But <del>you</del><ins>the Anonymous Coward</ins> already told us how to phrase things above: "let $a,b,c$ be objects of $C$ and let $g : b \to c$,$f: a \to b$ be morphisms".  So now we take a case where $dom g$ and $cod f$ are not definitionally/syntactically equal, as so:
> Let $a,b,c,d$ be objects and let $g: c \to d,\; f: a \to b$ be morphisms.
Then we can form the composite $g \circ f$ relative to any isomophism $h: b \to c$.  (Of course, the notation $g \circ f$ suppresses $h$, so it\'s more proper to write $g \circ_h f$, or just $g \circ h \circ f$ as a normal person would.)

Note that the definability of $g \circ f$ is now the set $Iso(b,c)$ rather than the truth value $b = c$.  In an $\infty$-category, it would be an $\infty$-groupoid $Iso(b,c)$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: That wasn't me above, I don't think.  I would consider "let $g : b \to c$ and $f: a \to b$ be morphisms" as implicitly using dependent types if you're considering it to avoid evil.  It seems to me that in a non-dependently typed theory, the only thing "let $g : b \to c$ and $f: a \to b$ be morphisms" can mean is "let $g$ and $f$ be morphisms such that $\dom f = a$, $\cod f = b$, $\dom g = b$, and $\cod g=c$," which does involve talking about equality of objects.

_Toby_:  Right on both counts: that was an [[Anonymous Coward]] in the first comment, and the phrasing that the Coward suggested does implicitly use dependent types (as I alluded to in my original reply).  Makkai says 'dependent sorts' (the 'DS' in 'FOLDS') instead for some reason.  Can we avoid evil in an independently typed (possibly even untyped) language?  I think that this should be possible; we would need rules about when you can and can\'t state equalities; maybe, you can state $\forall f, dom f = x \Rightarrow ...$ and the obvious variations, but no others?

[[Mike Shulman]]: In other words, you can secretly make your independent types act like dependent ones?  (-:

_Toby_:  Yeah, a dependent type theory can always be rephrased as an independent type theory, although you have to use equality to do this; this is equivalent to the original dependent type theory if (as is the common practice) that theory also had equality predicates, but otherwise it\'s stonger.  Similarly, a typed theory can be rephrased as an untyped theory, although you have to use typing predicates to do this, and again this is stronger.  Conversely, we know (well, some people know) how to limit the use of the typing predicates in the untyped theory to make it equivalent to the typed theory.  Now I think that there also ought to be rules to limit the use of equality in a simple type theory to make it equivalent to a dependent type theory *without* equality.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Amazingly enough, as you said at latest changes, this conversation does seem to be leading in the direction of actual mathematics.  It does seem like that should be possible, but I don't have the time to think about it any more deeply now.  Aside from pointing out the obvious fact that until we get to $\omega$-categories, we do want to allow equality relations on *some* of the types in the dependent type theory.

_Toby_:  I also don\'t have the time to think about it carefully; I feel pretty secure about my intuition, but that is all.  But I would see the equality relation between parallel $n$-morphisms in an $n$-category as something extralogical, just as much as the type of $n$-morphisms between parallel $(n-1)$-morphisms.

_Harry_: Couldn't we just say: Let $f$ and $g$ be (left? right?)-composable iff $h[dom g]$ is isomorphic to $h[cod f]$ where $h$ is the homotopy category functor (assuming quasicategories, but there should be a good enough way to define this in more generality, no?).  This way, $g \circ f$ is only specified up to homotopy (that is, we know that it's in the homotopy class of $h[g] \circ h[f]$.  I think there might be a few technicalities to work out with 1-Categories, but applying the homotopy functor immediately collapses it to that case.  

_Toby_:  That seems to bring us back to the idea of composing along an isomorphism between $dom g$ and $cod f$, now generalised to quasicategories.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Yes, if you only know that $h[dom g]$ is isomorphic to $h[cod f]$, you still need to *choose* an isomorphism along which to compose $f$ and $g$.  Different choices will give you different "composites".

_Harry_: Can two wrongs (or evils in this case) make a right?  Maybe we can solve the composition problem by passing to the skeleton of the homotopy category?
