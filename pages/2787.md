## Definition

An object $A$ of a [[concrete category]] $C$ is __finitely generated__ if it is a [[quotient object]] (in the sense of a [[regular epimorphism]]) of some [[free object]] $F$ in $C$, where $F$ is free on a [[finite set]].

The object $A$ is __finitely presented__ if it is the [[coequalizer]] of a [[parallel pair]] $R \rightrightarrows F$ such that $R$ is also free on a finite set.

See discussion at [[finitely presentable object]] more a more abstract version of these.  See also [[generators and relations]].


## Examples

*  For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-[[module]] $N$ is finitely generated if it is a [[free module]] with a finite [[basis of a free module|basis]].
