## Definition

An object $A$ of a [[concrete category]] $C$ is __finitely generated__ if it is a [[quotient object]] of some [[free object]] $F$ in $C$, where $F$ is free on a [[finite set]].  (We probably want 'quotient object' here to be interpreted in the sense of a [[regular epimorphism]] from $F$ to $C$, although perhaps we explicitly want it to be the quotient of a [[congruence]] on $F$.)

The object $A$ is __finitely presented__ if it is the quotient of a [[congruence]] $R \rightrightarrows F$ such that $R$ is also free on a finite set.  (Or maybe we don\'t demand that this is a congruence but accept any [[coequaliser]] of this form?)

See discussion at [[finitely presentable object]] more a more abstract version of these.


## Examples

*  For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-[[module]] $N$ is finitely generated if it is a [[free module]] with a finite [[basis]].
