## Idea

Analytic spaces are [[spaces]] that are locally modeled on [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of subalgebras [[associative algebra|algebras]] of [[power series]] algebras on elements with certain convergence properties.

There are _rigid analytic spaces_, defined with respect to maximal spectra of these algebras, and _analytic spaces_ defined with respect to a kind of [[Gelfand spectrum]], due to [[Vladimir Berkovich]]. For the former definition see _[[rigid analytic geometry]]_. This entry is concerned with the more general notion due to Berkovich, which makes sense also over trivially [[valuation|valued]] and [[non-archimedean fields]].

For more background see _[[analytic geometry]]_.

## Definition

Let $k$ be a [[non-archimedean field]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$  and positive elements $\{r_1, \cdots, r_n \in k\}$, consider the sub-[[power series]] [[associative algebra|algebra]] over $k$ defined by

$$
  \{\frac{1}{r_1} T_1 , \cdots, \frac{1}{r_n}T_n\}
  :=
  \left\{
    \sum_\nu a_\nu T^\nu | \lim_{{\vert \nu\vert} \to 0} {\vert a_\nu \vert} r^\nu = 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This is a commutative [[Banach algebra]] over $k$ with [[norm]] ${\Vert f \Vert} = max {\vert a_\nu\vert} r^\nu$.

A **$k$-[[affinoid algebra]]** is a commutative Banach $k$-algebra $A$ for which there exists $n$ and $\{r_i\}$ as above and an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  \{\frac{1}{r_1} T_1 , \cdots, \frac{1}{r_n}T_n\}
  \to 
  A
$$

such that the norm on $A$ is the quotient norm.

If one can choose here $r_i = 1$ for all $i$ then $A$ is called **strictly $k$-affinoid**.

The [[category]] of **$k$-affinoid spaces** is the [[opposite category]] of the category of $k$-affinoid algebras and bounded [[homomorphisms]] between them.

=--

Via the [[analytic spectrum]] there is a [[topological space]] associated with any $k$-affinoid space.
 
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **$k$-analytic space** is a space obtained by gluing of $k$-affinoid spaces. 

More precisely (...)

## Properties

### Local contractibility
 {#LocalContractibility}

A [[complex numbers|complex]] analytic space is locally isomorphic to a [[polydisk]] and hence is trivially a [[locally contractible space]]. But over a [[non-archimedean field]] analytic spaces no longer need to be locally isomorphic to polydisks (but $p$-adic polydisks are still contractible ([Berkovich 90](#Berkovich90))). The following result establishes under mild conditions, that general analytic spaces are nevertheless locally contractible.



Assume that the [[valuation]] on the ground field $k$ is nontrivial.

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyEmbeddableInASmoothSpace}
###### Definition

A $k$-analytic space $X$ is called _locally embeddable in a smooth space_ if each point of $X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a strictly $k$-analytic domain in smooth $k$-analytic space.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Every $k$-analytic space which is locally embeddable in a smooth space, def. \ref{LocallyEmbeddableInASmoothSpace}, is a [[locally contractible space]].

This is [Berkovich (1999), theorem 9.1](#BerkovichContractible).
