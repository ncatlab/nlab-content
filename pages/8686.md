Given a Lie algebra $g$ flat as a $k$-module over a commmutative ground ring $k\supset\mathbb{Q}$ containing rationals, consider the enveloping algebra $U(g)=\cup_{i= 0}^\infty U^i(g)$ as a filtered algebra and a Hopf algebra where $g$ is the subspace of [[primitive element]]s. The __Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem__ (often abbreviated to PBW theorem) says that the associated graded algebra is canonically isomorphic to the symmetric algebra $Sym(g)$ as an algebra, and the projection $U(g)\to Gr U(g)\cong Sym(g)$ is an  isomorphism of $k$-coalgebras.  

The fact that associated graded algebra is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra is a weak form of the theorem and it is usually proved either by very explicit and long calculation constructing certain representation or by application of the [[zoranskoda:diamond lemma]]. The induced Poisson structure on $Sym(g)$ is the linear Poisson structure for the corresponding $g$.
