## Definition

In the [[2-topos]] [[Cat]], the pair of classes of morphisms ([[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] functors, [[fully faithful functors]]) form a [[factorization system in a 2-category]].  This factorization system can also be restricted to the [[(2,1)-topos]] [[Grpd]].

In fact, an analogous factorization system exists in any regular 2-category and any (2,1)-exact (2,1)-category, including any Grothendieck 2-topos or (2,1)-topos; see [[michaelshulman:regular morphism|here]].

## Properties

* The factorization of a functor in this factorization system is the construction of its [[full image]].

* More on this for the case of functors between [[groipoids]] is at _[infinity-image --  Of Functors between groupoids](infinity-image#NImagesOf1FunctorsBetweenGroupoids)_.
