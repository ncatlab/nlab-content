Yuri Ivanovich Manin (Russian: Юрий Иванович Манин) a Russian-born mathematician of polymath broadness, with main works in [[number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]], [[noncommutative geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]]. His diverse work includes a classification theorem in the theory of commutative [[formal group]], early study of monoidal transformations and exposition on [[motive]]s in 1960-s, a fundamental starting work in [[quantum information theory]], proposals on [[quantum logic]]s, an approach to [[quantum group]]s, ADHM construction in [[soliton]] theory, work with [[Maxim Kontsevich]] on [[Gromov-Witten invariants]], work on [[Frobenius manifold]]s (and introduced more general "F-manifolds" with Claus Hertling). He published a number of influential monographs including on [[noncommutative geometry]], [[quantum group]]s, [[complex geometry]] and [[gauge theory|gauge theories]], introduction to [[scheme]]s, [[Frobenius manifold]]s, mathematical [[logic]]s... His students include [[A. Beilinson]], [[V. Drinfel'd]], Vera Serganova, Ivan Penkov, [[M. Kapranov]], Yu. Tschinkel...
