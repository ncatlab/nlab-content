
Given a [[concrete category]], that is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[functor]] $U$ from $C$ to the [[category of sets]] (satisfying certain conditions), we call $U$ a [[forgetful functor]] and call $U(x)$, for $x$ an [[object]] on $C$, the __underyling set__ of $x$.

In the case where $C$ is explicitly a category of [[structured sets]], then every object $x$ of $C$ is a [[set]] ${|x|}$ equipped with some [[structure]].  In that case, the underlying set of $x$ is precisely this set ${|x|}$.
