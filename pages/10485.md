## Idea

**Symmetry Protected Trivial order (SPT order)** (also known as **Symmetry Protected Topological order**) is a new kind of order in zero-temperature [[solid state physics|states of matter]] that have a [[symmetry]] and a finite energy gap. The SPT order has the following defining properties:

1. distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a [[phase transition]], if the deformation preserves the symmetry.
1. however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation.

Using the notion of quantum entanglement, we can say that SPT states are short-range [[entanglement|entangled states]] with a symmetry.  
Using the notion of [[topological order]], we can say that SPT states are symmetric states with trivial [[topological order]].


## Examples of SPT order

The first example of SPT order is the Haldane phase of spin-1 chain. It is a SPT phase protected by the $SO(3)$ spin [[rotation group]] symmetry. Another example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by U(1) and time reversal symmetry.

## Group cohomology theory for SPT phases

Recently, it was shown that the bosonic SPT orders are described by [[group cohomology]] theory: **d+1D SPT states with on-site symmetry G are labeled by the elements in group cohomology class $H^{d+1} [G, U(1)]$.** It was also shown that the fermionic SPT orders are described by group super-cohomology theory. 

So the group (super-)cohomology theory may allow us to classify all SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

## SPT phases in free fermion systems

Free fermion system can also have non-trivial SPT phases, such as [[topological insulator]]s and topological superconductors. Those free fermion SPT phases are classified by K-theory.
