## Idea

**Symmetry Protected Trivial order (SPT order)** (also known as **Symmetry Protected Topological order**) is a new kind of order in zero-temperature [[solid state physics|states of matter]] that have a [[symmetry]] and a finite energy gap. The SPT order has the following defining properties:

1. distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a [[phase transition]], if the deformation preserves the symmetry.
1. however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation.

Using the notion of [[topological order]], we can say that SPT states are states with trivial [[topological order]] and a symmetry.
Using the notion of quantum entanglement, we can say that SPT states are short-range [[entanglement|entangled states]] with a symmetry.  

## Examples of SPT order

The first example of SPT order is the Haldane phase of spin-1 chain. It is a SPT phase protected by the $SO(3)$ spin [[rotation group]] symmetry. Another example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by U(1) and time reversal symmetry.

## Group cohomology theory for SPT phases

Recently, it was shown that the bosonic SPT orders are described by [[group cohomology]] theory: d+1D SPT states with symmetry G are labeled by the elements in group cohomology class $H^{d+1} [G, U(1)]$. It was also shown that the fermionic SPT orders are described by group super-cohomology theory. 

So the group (super-)cohomology theory may allow us to classify all SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

## Relation between SPT order and topological order

SPT states are short-range entangled while [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states are long-range entangled. Topologically ordered states have emergent fractional charge, emergent fractional statistics, and emergent gauge theory. In contrast, SPT states have no emergent fractional charge/fractional statistics for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent gauge theory (due to their short-ranged entanglement).

SPT orders are described by group cohomology theory while [[topological order]]s are
described by n-category theory.
