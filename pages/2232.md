## Idea

In general, the _center_ (or _centre_) of an [[algebra|algebraic]] [[object]] $A$ is the collection of [[elements]] of $A$ which "commute with all elements of $A$."  This has a number of specific incarnations.

## Definitions

### Of groups and monoids

The original example is the __center__ $Z(G)$ of a [[group]] $G$, which is defined to be the [[subgroup]] consisting of all elements $g\in G$ such that for all elements $h\in H$ the equality $g h=h g$ holds.  The center is an [[abelian group|abelian]] subgroup, but not every abelian subgroup is in the center.  See also [[centralizer]].

This notion of center of a group can be generalized to the center of a [[monoid]] in an obvious way.

###### Definition

Let $C$ be an object in a [[2-category]]. The center of $C$, $Z(C)$ is the [[monoid]] of [[endomorphisms]] of the identity morphism, $id_C : C \rightarrow C$.

One can invoke the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] to prove that vertical and horizontal composition agree on $Z(C)$ and are commutative. 

### Of Lie algebras

The __center of a [[Lie algebra]]__ $L$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra $Z(L)$, consisting of all elements $ z\in L$ such that $[l,z]=0$ for all $l\in L$. There are generalizations for some other kinds of algebras.


### Of categories and higher categories {#OfCategories}

The center of a monoid can be [[horizontal categorification|horizontally categorified]] to the center of a [[category]].  Specifically, the _center of a category_ $C$ is defined to be the commutative monoid $[C,C](Id_C,Id_C)$ of [[natural transformation|endo-natural-transformations]] of the [[identity functor]] of $C$.  It is straightforward to check that this reduces to the usual definition if $C = \mathbf{B}(A,\times)$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[monoid]]. 

* For a [[generator]] $G$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ there is an embedding of $Z(\mathcal{C})$ into the monoid $Hom(G,G)$ given by $\eta\mapsto\eta _G$. In particular, if $Hom(G,G)$ or $Z(Hom(G,G))$ is trivial, as happens e.g. for $Set$ with $G=\ast$, then so is $Z(\mathcal{C})$ (Hofmann 1975).

* For [[Cauchy completion|Cauchy complete]] $\mathcal{C}$ the idempotent elements of $Z(\mathcal{C})$ correspond precisely to the _quintessential localizations_ of $\mathcal{C}$ (Johnstone 1996).

The notion of center can also be [[vertical categorification|vertically categorified]].  It is easy to categorify the notion of center of a category as defined above: if $C$ is an [[n-category]], then its _center_ is the monoidal $(n-1)$-category $[C,C](Id_C,Id_C)$ of endo-transformations of its identity functor.  One expects that in general, this center will actually admit a natural structure of *braided* monoidal $(n-1)$-category, just as the center of a category is actually a commutative monoid, not merely a monoid.

For instance if $C = \mathbf{B}_\otimes \mathcal{C}$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[monoidal category]], then this center is called the _[[Drinfeld center]]_ of $(C, \otimes)$.


Generally, we can now obtain a notion of the center of a monoidal $n$-category by regarding it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, according to the [[delooping hypothesis]].  It follows that the center of a monoidal $n$-category should naturally be a braided monoidal $n$-category.  This is known to be true when $n=0$ (the center of a monoid is a commutative monoid) and also for $n=1$ and $n=2$.

Note that a monoidal $n$-category has two different centers: if we regard it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, then its center is a braided monoidal $n$-category, but if we regard it merely as an $n$-category, then its center is a braided monoidal $(n-1)$-category. The latter construction makes no reference to the monoidal structure. Likewise, a braided monoidal $n$-category has three different centers, depending on whether we regard it as an $n$-category, a connected $(n+1)$-category, or a 2-connected $(n+2)$-category, and so on (a $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category has $k+1$ different centers).

It seems that in applications, however, one is usually most interested in the sort of center of a monoidal $n$-category $C$ obtained by regarding it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, thereby obtaining a braided monoidal $n$-category.  It is in this case, and seemingly this case only, that the center comes with a natural forgetful functor to $C$, corresponding to the classical inclusion of the center of a monoid.  (For $n\gt 0$, however, this functor will not be an inclusion; the objects of the center of $C$ are objects of $C$ equipped with additional [[stuff, structure, property|structure]].)

Moreover, one expects that if we perform this "canonical" operation on a [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] (for $k\ge 1$), the resulting braided monoidal $n$-category will actually be $(k+1)$-tuply monoidal.  This is known to be true in the cases $n\le 4$: the center of a braided monoidal category is symmetric monoidal, the center of a braided monoidal 2-category is sylleptic, and the center of a sylleptic monoidal 2-category is symmetric.

Finally, if we decategorify further, we find that the center of a [[set]] (i.e. a [[0-category]]) is a monoidal [[(-1)-category]], i.e. the [[truth value]] "true."  This is what we ought to expect, since when $C$ is a set, there is precisely one endo-transformation of its identity endofunction (namely, the identity).

An old query about the categorical notion of center is archived at $n$Forum [here](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2715&Focus=22852#Comment_22852).


#### Of abelian categories

A special case is the [[center of an abelian category]] which has a special entry because of a number of special applications and properties.
