__Cédric Villani__ is a French mathematician working in [[partial differential equations]], especially those appearing in [[classical physics|classical]] [[mathematical physics]] and differential geometry. Villani extensively worked on the topic of optimal transport and its applications to differential geometry. Villani was awarded the Fields medal at Hyderabad in 2010 for the study of Boltzmann equation (especially its hydrodynamic limit) and nonlinear Landau damping,
