## Idea

In [[higher algebra]]/[[higher category theory]] one can define (generalized) [[algebra|algebraic structures]] [[internalization|internal]] to [[categories]] which themselves are equipped with certain algebraic structure, in fact with the _same kind_ of algebraic structure. In ([Baez-Dolan 97](#BaezDolan)) this has been called the _microcosm principle_.

>**Microcosm principle**: _Certain [[algebra|algebraic structures]] can be defined [[internalization|in]] any category equipped with a [[categorification|categorified version]] of the same structure._ 

A standard example is the notion of _[[monoid object]]_ which make sense in a _[[monoidal category]]_, and the notion of _[[commutative monoid object]]_ which makes sense in a _[[symmetric monoidal category]]_.

The term "microcosm principle" arises from the idea that the monoid object (the 'microcosm') can only thrive in a category (a 'macrocosm') that resembles itself. 

## Formalization for algebras over (∞,1)-operads

The microcosm principle is a general heuristic, but in some contexts, a general version of it can be proven formally.  One such formalization was given (independently) in ([Lurie](##Lurie)) in the context of [[higher algebra]] in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

given an [[(∞,1)-operad]] $\mathcal{O}$ we have:

1. an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with algebraic structure as encoded by $\mathcal{O}$ -- an $\mathcal{O}$-[[monoidal (∞,1)-category]] -- is equivalently encoded by a [[coCartesian fibration of (∞,1)-operads]] $\mathcal{C}^\otimes \to \mathcal{O}^\otimes$;

1. an [[(∞,1)-algebra over an (∞,1)-operad]] over $\mathcal{O}$ can be defined internal to such a $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category  $\mathcal{C}$ and is equivalently given by a [[section]] of this map. 

See at _[[(∞,1)-algebra over an (∞,1)-operad]]_ for examples and further details.
