## Idea

In [[higher algebra]]/[[higher category theory]] one can define (generalized) [[algebra|algebraic structures]] [[internalization|internal]] to [[categories]] which themselves are equipped with certain algebraic structure, in fact with the _same kind_ of algebraic structure. In ([Baez-Dolan 97](#BaezDolan)) this has been called the _microcosm principle_.

>**Microcosm principle**: _Certain [[algebra|algebraic structures]] can be defined [[internalization|in]] any category equipped with a [[categorification|categorified version]] of the same structure._ 

A standard example is the notion of _[[monoid object]]_ which make sense in a _[[monoidal category]]_, and the notion of _[[commutative monoid object]]_ which makes sense in a _[[symmetric monoidal category]]_.

Moreover, in many cases the "internal" version of the structure can be identified with [[lax morphisms]] of categorified strurctures with [[terminal object|terminal]] domain.  For instance, a monoid in a monoidal category is equivalently a [[lax monoidal functor]] with terminal domain.  More generally, the categorified structure can often be generalized to a "virtual" ([[generalized multicategory]]-like) structure.

The term "microcosm principle" arises from the idea that the monoid object (the 'microcosm') can only thrive in a category (a 'macrocosm') that resembles itself. 

## Examples

* [[monoid objects]] can be defined in [[monoidal categories]] (categorified monoids), or more generally [[multicategories]] (virtual monoidal categories).
* [[commutative monoid objects]] can be defined in [[symmetric monoidal categories]], or more generally in [[braided monoidal categories]].
* Categorifying these examples, [[monoidal categories]] are instances of [[pseudomonoids]], which can be defined in any [[monoidal bicategory]].  There are also versions for braided, symmetric, closed, compact closed, and so on.
* [[trace in a bicategory|traces]] can be defined in bicategories equipped with a [[shadow]] (a categorified trace).
* [[categories]] are instances of [[monads]], which can be defined in any [[bicategory]] or more generally any [[double category]] (both a kind of categorified category) or [[virtual double category]].  This generalization includes [[internal categories]] and [[enriched categories]].
* [[enriched categories]] are also objects of the free cocompletion of an [[enriched bicategory]] under a kind of [[Kleisli object]].
* [[generalized multicategories]] are naturally defined internal to a [[virtual double category]], which is itself a kind of generalized multicategory.
* [[double categories]] are instances of [[intermonads]], which can be defined in any [[intercategory]] (a categorified double category).
* [[duoids]] (objects with two monoidal structures) can be defined in any [[duoidal category]] (a category with two monoidal structures).
* [[Frobenius algebras]] can be defined in any [[star-autonomous category]], and cocomplete $\ast$-autonomous posets are Frobenius algebras in the $\ast$-autonomous category [[Sup]], while [[promonoidal category|pro]]-$\ast$-autonomous categories are [[Frobenius pseudomonoids]] in the $\ast$-autonomous (indeed, compact closed) bicategory [[Prof]].
* The prototypical example of a [[2-fibration]] consists of internal [[fibrations in a 2-category]].
* [[type theories]] can be defined relative to any "2-type theory"; see [[adjoint type theory]].

## Formalizations

The microcosm principle is a general heuristic, but in some contexts, general versions of it can be defined and proven formally.  These do not generally include all examples, but often include many of them.

### For $n$-categorical operad algebras

[Baez and Dolan](#BaezDolan) gave the following precise definition: for any [[operad]] $\mathcal{O}$, an $n$-categorical $\mathcal{O}$-algebra internal to an $(n+1))$-categorical $\mathcal{O}$-algebra $A$ is a [[lax morphism]] from the [[terminal object|terminal]] $(n+1))$-categorical $\mathcal{O}$-algebra to $A$.

### For categorical algebras over cartesian monads

[Batanin](#Batanin) gave the following definition: for a [[cartesian monad]] $T$, an internal $T$-algebra in an algebra $A$ for the extension of $T$ to [[internal categories]] is a lax $T$-morphism from the [[terminal object|terminal]] such algebra to $A$.  More generally, $A$ can be an algebra for some other monad, for instance which builds in some commutativity.

### For categorical algebras over Lawvere theories

[Hasuo, Jacobs, and Sokolova](#HJS) gave the following very similar definition: for a [[Lawvere theory]] $L$, an internal $L$-algebra in a categorical $L$-algebra (an $L$-algebra in [[Cat]]) is a lax $L$-morphism from the [[terminal object|terminal]] such algebra to $A$.  They used this to prove a general result about the liftings of $L$-algebra structures to coalgebras.

### For algebras over (∞,1)-operads

Another such formalization was given (independently) in ([Lurie](##Lurie)) in the context of [[higher algebra]] in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

given an [[(∞,1)-operad]] $\mathcal{O}$ we have:

1. an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with algebraic structure as encoded by $\mathcal{O}$ -- an $\mathcal{O}$-[[monoidal (∞,1)-category]] -- is equivalently encoded by a [[coCartesian fibration of (∞,1)-operads]] $\mathcal{C}^\otimes \to \mathcal{O}^\otimes$;

1. an [[(∞,1)-algebra over an (∞,1)-operad]] over $\mathcal{O}$ can be defined internal to such a $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category  $\mathcal{C}$ and is equivalently given by a [[section]] of this map. 

See at _[[(∞,1)-algebra over an (∞,1)-operad]]_ for examples and further details.
