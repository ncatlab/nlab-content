## Idea

The operation of [[stabilization]] that sends an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ to the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $Stab(C)$ does not in general extend to a functor.

We may think of this operation as the analog of _linearizing_ a space. Turning an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ into a functor $Stab(C) \to Stab(D)$ is not unlike performing a first order Taylor expansion of a function.

This is what Goodwillie calculus studies.

Let $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ (where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are each either $Top_*$, the category of pointed topological spaces, or $Spec$, the category of spectra) be a pointed homotopy functor. Associate with $F$ a sequence of spectra, called the derivatives of $F$, denoted by $\partial_1 F, \partial_2 F,\cdots, \partial_n F, \cdots$, or, collectively, by $\partial_* F$. For each $n$ the spectrum $\partial_n F$ has a natural action of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. Thus, $\partial_* F$ is a symmetric sequence of spectra.

The derivatives of $F$ contain substantial information about the homotopy type of $F$. We can form a sequence of 'approximations' to $F$ together with natural transformations forming a so-called *Taylor tower*. This tower takes the form

$$
F \to \cdots \to P_n F \to P_{n-1} F \to \cdots\to P_0 F
$$

with $P_n F$ being the universal *n-excisive* approximation to $F$. (A functor is $n$-excisive if it takes any $n + 1$-dimensional cube with homotopy pushout squares for faces to a homotopy cartesian cube.) For 'analytic' $F$, this tower converges for sufficiently highly connected $X$, that is

$$
F(X) \simeq \underset{n}{holim} P_n F(X).
$$

The fibre $D_n F$ of the map $P_n F \to P_{n-1} F$ is an *n-homogeneous* functor in an appropriate sense, and is determined by $\partial_n F$, via the following formula. If $F$ takes values in $Spec$ then

$$
D_n F(X) \simeq (\partial_n F \wedge X^{\wedge n})_{h \Sigma_n}.
$$

If $F$ takes values in $Top_*$ then one needs to prefix the right hand side with $\Omega^{\infty}$. (Arone & Ching)


### Analogy between homotopy theory and calculus {#Analogy}

Here is an overview of the relation between [[homotopy theory]]/[[∞-groupoid]] theory and [[algebraic approaches to differential calculus|differential calculus]] that is the starting point for Goodwillie calculus.

Write $k[ [x] ]$ for the [[ring]] of [[formal power series]] in one
variable over a [[field]] $k$. The ring $k[ [x] ]$ bears some resemblances
with the category of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[homotopy type]]s (= pointed spaces up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s). The category of pointed
homotopy types is a ring (the product is the [[smash product]]
and the sum is the [[wedge]]).


The following dictionary indicates what the correspondence between the two subjects is.

* $k$ $\stackrel{corresponds to}{\mapsto}$ the category of [[pointed set]]s;

* $k[ [x] ]$ 
  $\mapsto$ 
  the category of pointed [[homotopy type]]s;

* $x$ $\mapsto$ the pointed circle;

* the augmentation $(k[ [x] ] \to k)$ 
  $\mapsto$ 
  the [[homotopy group|connected components functor]] 
  $\pi_0$ :  pointed homotopy types $\to$ pointed sets

* the augmentation ideal $J$
  $\mapsto$
  the [[subcategory]] of pointed [[connected]] spaces;

* the $n+1$ power of the augmentation ideal 
  $J^{n+1}$
  $\mapsto$
  the subcategory of pointed $n$-[[connected]] spaces;

* the product of an element in $J^{n+1}$ 
  with an element of $J^{m+1}$ is an element of 
  $J^{n+m+2}$
  $\mapsto$
  the [[smash product]] of an $n$-[[connected]] space 
  with a $m$-connected space is $(n+m+1)$-connected;

* multiplication by $x$ $\mapsto$ the [[suspension]] functor.

* division by $x$ $\mapsto$ the [[loop space]] functor;

  Notice here the difference: the loop functor is 
  [[right adjoint]] to the suspension functor, not its [[inverse]]. 
  Moreover, the loop space of a space has a special structure 
  (it is a [[group object in an (infinity,1)-category|group]]).

* the ideal $J=x k[ [x] ]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] 
  to $k[ [x] ]$ via division by $x$
  $\mapsto$
  similarly, the category of pointed connected spaces is equivalent 
  to the category of topological groups via the loop space 
  functor (it is actually an [[Quillen equivalence]] 
  of [[model categories]]).

* More generally, the ideal $J^{n+1}$ is isomorphic to 
  $k[ [x] ]$ via division by $x^{n+1}$.
  $\mapsto$
  similarly, the category of $n$-connected spaces is 
  equivalent to the category of $(n+1)$-fold 
  [[topological group]]s 
  (it is actually an [[Quillen equivalence]] of 
  [[model categories]]) via the $(n+1)$-fold loop space functor.

* the quotient ring $k[ [x] ]/J^{n+1}$ $\mapsto$
  the category of $n$-truncated homotopy types 
  (=[[homotopy n-type]]s)

* The sequence of approximations of a 
  formal power series $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+ \cdots $

  $a_0$

  $a_0+a_1 x$

  $a_0+a_1 x + a_2 x^2$

  $\cdots$

  $\mapsto$

  the [[Postnikov tower]] of a pointed homotopy type $X$:

  $[\pi_0(X)]$

  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X)]$

  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X); \pi_2(X)]$

  $\cdots$

  Here, $\pi_0(X)$ is the set of connected components of 
  $X$, $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X)]$ is the [[fundamental groupoid]] 
  of $X$,
  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X); \pi_2(X)]$
  is the fundamental 2-groupoid of $X$, etc.


* The differences between $f(x)$ and its successives approximations

  $$
   \begin{aligned}
     R_0 = f(x)-a_0  &= a_1 x+a_2 x^2+a_3 x^3+ \cdots
     \\
     R_1 = f(x)-(a_0+a_1 x) &= a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4+ \cdots
     \\
     R_2 = f(x)-(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2) &= a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 +\cdots
   \end{aligned}
  $$

  $\mapsto$
  
  the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$,

  $C_0=[0;\pi_1(X), \pi_2(X), \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  $C_1=[0;0, \pi_2(X), \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  $C_2=[0;0, 0, \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  Here, $C_0$ is the connected component of $X$ at the base point,
  $C_1$ is the [[universal cover]] of $X$ constructed by from 
  paths starting at the base point,
  $C_2$ is the universal 2-cover of $X$ 
  constructed from paths starting the base point, etc.

* Division by $x$ is shifting down the coefficients of a 
  power series.

  If $f(x)=a_1 x+a_2 x^2 + \cdots$, 
  then $f(x)/x= a_1+a_1 x^2+ \cdots $

  Similarly, the loop space functor is shifting down 
  the homotopy groups
  of a pointed space: 

  if $X=[a_0,a_1,a_2,...]$ then $\Omega(X)=[a_1,a_2,....]$.

  Unfortunately, the [[suspension]] functor does not shift 
  up the [[homotopy group]]s of a space. It is however shifting 
  the first $2n$ homotopy groups of an $n$-connected space $X$ 
  $(n \geq 1)$ by the
  [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

  For example, if $X=[0;0,a_2, a_3,...]$ then 
  $\Sigma X=[0;0,0,a_2,a_3...]$,
  and if $X=[0;0,0, a_3, a_4, a_5,...]$ then 
  $\Sigma X=[0;0,0, 0, a_3, a_4, a_5,...]$.

  In other words, the canonical map $X \to \Omega X$
  is a $2n$-equivalence if $X$ is $n$-[[connected]] 
  $(n \geq 1)$.
  If $X[2n]$ denotes the $2n$-type of $X$ 
  (the $2n$-[[truncated|truncation]] of $X$),
  then we have a [[homotopy equivalence]]

  $X[2n]  \to \Omega \Sigma X[2n] \simeq \Omega \Sigma X[2n+1]$.

From a blog [discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/smooth_structures_in_ottawa.html#c020698)

Arone and Kankaanrinta in [The Goodwillie tower of the identity is a logarithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.53.8306) write

>The Goodwillie tower of the identity...is a tower of functors and natural transformations, which starts with stable homotopy and converges to unstable homotopy. (p. 1)

>...the Goodwillie tower is an inverse to stable homotopy in the same way as logarithm is an inverse to exponential. (p. 1)

>It is the point of this paper that the Goodwillie tower is the homotopy theoretic analog of logarithmic expansion, rather than of Taylor series. (p. 6)

What's going on, they say, is like finding a function of the form $a^{x - 1}$ which best approximates $x$. This is when $a = e$.

The functor from spaces to spaces which sends $X$ to 

$$
\Omega^{\infty}\Sigma^{\infty} X = colim \Omega^n \Sigma^n X
$$

sends coproducts to products and is supposed to be like $e^{x - 1}$.
(The "$-1$" comes about from issues to do with basepoints.)

A homogeneous linear functor is defined to be one sending coproducts
to products, so it is like an exponential.  Compared to an exponential, the identity functor is like a logarithm, so it has a non-trivial Taylor series.

>...our point of view is that stable homotopy is analogous to the function $e^{x - 1}$ rather than to a linear function, and the Goodwillie tower is an infinite product, rather than an infinite sum, namely it is analogous to the product

$$
e^{x - 1} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x - 1)^2}{2}} \cdot e^{\frac{(x - 1)^3}{3}} \ldots = e^{ln(1 + (x - 1))} = x. 
$$

>Covariant functors from the category of pointed sets to the category of pointed topological spaces are sometimes called $\Gamma$-spaces, and they have been important in algebraic topology. One reason is that $\Gamma$-[[Gamma-space|spaces]] model infinite loop spaces (and therefore connective spectra) and are very helpful for understanding stable homotopy theory.

>$\Gamma$-spaces also serve as a model for particularly well-behaved covariant functors from the category of pointed topological spaces to itself. Of course, these functors play an important role in topology as well. I like to think of Goodwillie's Calculus of Homotopy Functors (and also of Michael Weiss's Orthogonal Calculus) as a kind of "sheaf theory for covariant functors". In these theories, covariant functors are analogous to presheaves and linear functors are analogous to sheaves (The definition of a linear functor is essentially a homotopy-invariant version of the definition of a sheaf). The process of approximating a general functor by a linear one is analogous to sheafification, and so forth. These theories provide methods for studying certain types of functors, but of course they also tell you something about the category of spaces itself.

Eric Finster's [research statement](http://people.virginia.edu/~elf9e/research.pdf)

>One tantalizing aspect of the Goodwillie calculus is that it suggests the possibility of thinking geometrically about the global structure of homotopy theory. In this interpretation, the category of spectra plays the role of the tangent space to the category of spaces at the one-point space. Moreover, the identity functor from spaces to spaces is not linear...and one can interpret this as saying that spaces have some kind of non-trivial curvature.
