## Idea

The operation of [[stabilization]] that sends an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ to the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $Stab(C)$ does not in general extend to a functor.

We may think of this operation as the analog of _linearizing_ a space. Turning an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ into a functor $Stab(C) \to Stab(D)$ is not unlike performing a first order Taylor expansion of a function.

This is what Goodwillie calculus studies.


### Analogy between homotopy theory and calculus {#Analogy}

Here is an overview of the relation between [[homotopy theory]]/[[∞-groupoid]] theory and [[algebraic approaches to differential calculus|differential calculus]] that is the starting point for Goodwillie calculus.

Write $k[ [x] ]$ for the [[ring]] of [[formal power series]] in one
variable over a [[field]] $k$. The ring $k[ [x] ]$ bears some ressemblances
with the category of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[homotopy type]]s (= pointed spaces up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s). The category of pointed
homotopy types is a ring (the product is the [[smash product]]
and the sum is the [[wedge]]).


The following disctionary indicates what the correspondence between the two subjects is.

* $k$ $\stackrel{corresponds to}{\mapsto}$ the category of [[pointed set]]s;

* $k[ [x] ]$ 
  $\mapsto$ 
  the category of pointed [[homotopy type]]s;

* $x$ $\mapsto$ the pointed circle;

* the augmentation $(k[ [x] ] \to k)$ 
  $\mapsto$ 
  the [[homotopy group|connected components functor]] 
  $\pi_0$ :  pointed homotopy types $\to$ pointed sets

* the augmentation ideal $J$
  $\mapsto$
  the [[subcategory]] of pointed [[connected]] spaces;

* the $n+1$ power of the augmentation ideal 
  $J^{n+1}$
  $\mapsto$
  the subcategory of pointed $n$-[[connected]] spaces;

* the product of an element in $J^{n+1}$ 
  with an element of $J^{m+1}$ is an element of 
  $J^{n+m+2}$
  $\mapsto$
  the [[smash product]] of an $n$-[[connected]] space 
  with a $m$-connected space is $(n+m+1)$-connected;

* multiplication by $x$ $\mapsto$ the [[suspension]] functor.

* division by $x$ $\mapsto$ the [[loop space]] functor;

  Notice here the difference: the loop functor is 
  [[right adjoint]] to the suspension functor, not its [[inverse]]. 
  Moreover, the loop space of a space has a special structure 
  (it is a [[group object in an (infinity,1)-category|group]]).

* the ideal $J=x k[ [x] ]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] 
  to $k[ [x] ]$ via division by $x$
  $\mapsto$
  similarly, the category of pointed connected spaces is equivalent 
  to the category of topological groups via the loop space 
  functor (it is actually an [[Quillen equivalence]] 
  of [[model categories]]).

* More generally, the ideal $J^{n+1}$ is isomorphic to 
  $k[ [x] ]$ via division by $x^{n+1}$.
  $\mapsto$
  similarly, the category of $n$-connected spaces is 
  equivalent to the category of $(n+1)$-fold 
  [[topological group]]s 
  (it is actually an [[Quillen equivalence]] of 
  [[model categories]]) via the $(n+1)$-fold loop space functor.

* the quotient ring $k[ [x] ]/J^{n+1}$ $\mapsto$
  the category of $n$-truncated homotopy types 
  (=[[homotopy n-type]]s)

* The sequence of approximations of a 
  formal power series $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+ \cdots $

  $a_0$

  $a_0+a_1 x$

  $a_0+a_1 x + a_2 x^2$

  $\cdots$

  $\mapsto$

  the [[Postnikov tower]] of a pointed homotopy type $X$:

  $[\pi_0(X)]$

  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X)]$

  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X); \pi_2(X)]$

  $\cdots$

  Here, $\pi_0(X)$ is the set of connected components of 
  $X$, $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X)]$ is the [[fundamental groupoid]] 
  of $X$,
  $[\pi_0(X); \pi_1(X); \pi_2(X)]$
  is the fundamental 2-groupoid of $X$, etc.


* The differences between $f(x)$ and its successives approximations

  $$
   \begin{aligned}
     R_0 = f(x)-a_0  &= a_1 x+a_2 x^2+a_3 x^3+ \cdots
     \\
     R_1 = f(x)-(a_0+a_1 x) &= a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4+ \cdots
     \\
     R_2 = f(x)-(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2) &= a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 +\cdots
   \end{aligned}
  $$

  $\mapsto$
  
  the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$,

  $C_0=[0;\pi_1(X), \pi_2(X), \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  $C_1=[0;0, \pi_2(X), \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  $C_2=[0;0, 0, \pi_3(X), \cdots]$

  Here, $C_0$ is the connected component of $X$ at the base point,
  $C_1$ is the [[universal cover]] of $X$ constructed by from 
  paths starting at the base point,
  $C_2$ is the universal 2-cover of $X$ 
  constructed from paths starting the base point, etc.

* Division by $x$ is shifting down the coefficients of a 
  power series.

  If $f(x)=a_1 x+a_2 x^2 + \cdots$, 
  then $f(x)/x= a_1+a_1 x^2+ \cdots $

  Similarly, the loop space functor is shifting down 
  the homotopy groups
  of a pointed space: 

  if $X=[a_0,a_1,a_2,...]$ then $\Omega(X)=[a_1,a_2,....]$.

  Unfortunately, the [[suspension]] functor does not shift 
  up the [[homotopy group]]s of a space. It is however shifting 
  the first $2n$ homotopy groups of an $n$-connected space $X$ 
  $(n \geq 1)$ by the
  [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

  For example, if $X=[0;0,a_2, a_3,...]$ then 
  $\Sigma X=[0;0,0,a_2,b_3...]$,
  and if $X=[0;0,0, a_3, a_4, a_5,...]$ then 
  $\Sigma X=[0;0,0, 0, a_3, a_4, b_5,...]$.

  In other words, the canonical map $X \to \Omega X$
  is a $2n$-equivalence if $X$ is $n$-[[connected]] 
  $(n \geq 1)$.
  If $X[2n]$ denotes the $2n$-type of $X$ 
  (the $2n$-[[truncated|truncation]] of $X$),
  then we have a [[homotopy equivalence]]

  $X[2n]  \to \Omega \Sigma X[2n] \simeq \Omega \Sigma X[2n+1]$.
