## Statement

On a projective non-singular [[algebraic variety]] over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, any Hodge class is a rational linear combination of classes $cl(Z)$ of [[algebraic cycles]].

Van Geemen: An introduction to the Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties

[arXiv:0907.2503](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0907.2503) The Hodge conjecture for self-products of certain K3 surfaces
from arXiv Front: math.AG by Ulrich Schlickewei
We use a result of van Geemen to determine the endomorphism algebra of the
Kuga--Satake variety of a K3 surface with real multiplication. This is applied
to prove the Hodge conjecture for self-products of double covers of $\PP^2$
which are ramified along six lines.
