## Statement

On a smooth projective [[complex manifold]], every rational [[Hodge cycle]] is a linear combination of classes $cl(Z)$ of [[algebraic cycles]].

A [[pure motives|motivic]] reformulation is as follows.
Let $SmProj^{cor}_\mathbf{C}$ denote the category of [[algebraic correspondences]] of smooth projective [[algebraic varieties]] over the [[complex numbers]].
The canonical functor
  $$ SmProj^{cor} \to HS^{pure} $$
to the category of rational [[pure Hodge structures]], given by taking rational [[Betti cohomology]], is [[fully faithful]].

(The [[Tate conjecture]] is the analogue where $\mathbf{C}$ is replaced by a [[finite field]] or [[number field]], and the target category of [[pure Hodge structures]] is replaced by the [[l-adic representations]] of the [[absolute Galois group]].)

Van Geemen: An introduction to the Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties

[arXiv:0907.2503](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0907.2503) The Hodge conjecture for self-products of certain K3 surfaces
from arXiv Front: math.AG by Ulrich Schlickewei
We use a result of van Geemen to determine the endomorphism algebra of the
Kuga--Satake variety of a K3 surface with real multiplication. This is applied
to prove the Hodge conjecture for self-products of double covers of $\PP^2$
which are ramified along six lines.
