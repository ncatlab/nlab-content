### For cotangent bundles 

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $T^* X \to X$ its [[cotangent bundle]], there is a unique [[differential 1-form]] on $T^* X$ itself, 

$$
  \theta
   \in
  \Omga^1(T^* X)
$$

with the property that under the [[isomorphism]]

$$
  j \;\colon\; \Gamma(T^* X) \{\simeq}{\to} \Omega^1(X)
$$

between [[differential 1-forms]] and smooth [[sections]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] we have for every smooth section $\sigma \in \Gamma(T^* X)$ the identification

$$
  \sigma^* \theta = j(\sigma)
$$

between the [[pullback of a differential form|pullback]] of $\theta$ along $\sigma$ and the 1-form corresponing to $\sigma$ under $j$.

This unique differential 1-form $\theta \in \Omega^1(T^* X)$ is called the **Liouville form** or **Poincar√© 1-form** or **canonical form** or **tautological form** on the cotangent bundle.
