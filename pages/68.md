## Definition

A _differentiable stack_ is a [[stack]] on the [[site]] [[Diff]] of manifolds which is [[presented stack|presented]] by a [[Lie groupoid]].

##Remarks##

This means that a differentiable stack is in a way _nothing else_ but a Lie groupoid: but the point is that equivalence of stacks captures the notion of [[Morita equivalence]] of their presenting (Lie) groupoids.

This means that looking at a Lie groupoid in terms of the stack it presents provides a direct way to recognizing the right notion of equivalence of these objects. The notion of Morita equivalence, on the other hand, proceeds via the reasoning of [[homotopy theory]].

Notice that the stack [[presented stack|presented]] by a (Lie) groupoid $G$ is really the stack which sends every test manifold to the category of $G$-principal bundles over that manifold. Such a $G$-principal bundle, also known as a [[torsor]], is analogous to a [[module]] for an algebra. This explains the terminology of "Morita morphisms", which originates in algebra: 

Just as two algebras are Morita equivalent if their categories of modules are equivalent, two groupoids are Morita equivalent if their stacks of torsors are equivalent.
