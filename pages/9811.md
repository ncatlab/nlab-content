## Idea

Let $S$ be a [[noetherian scheme]].  The **h-topology** is a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the category of schemes, used by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] to construct a [[triangulated category]] $DM$ of [[mixed motive|mixed]] [[motives]].

## Definition

A morphism $p : X \to Y$ of [[schemes]] is called a [[topological epimorphism]] if the underlying topological space of $Y$ is a quotient space of the underlying topological space of $X$, i.e. $p$ is surjective and a subset $A \subset Y$ is open iff its preimage $p^{-1}(A) \subset X$ is open.  Such a morphism is further called a [[universal]] topological epimorphism if this property is preserved under any [[base change]].

Consider the [[pretopology]] on the category of [[schemes]] whose covering families are finite families $(p_i : U_i \to X)_i$ such that $p_i$ are of finite type and $\sqcup p_i : \sqcup U_i \to X$ is a [[topological epimorphism|universal topological epimorphism]].  The [[Grothendieck topology]] generated by this pretopology is called the **h-topology** on the category of schemes.

The h-topology is stronger than the [[etale topology|etale]] and [[proper topology|proper]] topologies.
