## Idea

A _formal neighbourhood_ is a [[neighbourhood]] in [[formal geometry]], hence an "[[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] neighbourhood". Also called a _[[formal completion]]_ or _[[formal disk]]_, see there for more.

## Examples 

* The [[formal spectrum]] of the [[completion of a commutative ring]] in the $I$-[[adic topology]] for a [[maximal ideal]] $I$ is the formal neighbourhood of the point corresponding to that ideal in the [[spectrum of a commutative ring]].
