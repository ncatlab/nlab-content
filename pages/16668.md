## Idea

In the context of [[supergravity]] and [[string theory]], the term _exceptional field theory_ has come to be used for formulations of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] which make the ([[exceptional Lie group|exceptional]], whence the name) [[U-duality]] [[symmetry group]] structure manifest. This is in generalization of the "[[double field theory]]" formulation of 10d [[type II supergravity]] which makes (only) the [[T-duality]] symmetry manifest. 

Accordingly, exceptional field theory is related to [[exceptional generalized geometry]] as [[double field theory]] is related to [[generalized complex geometry]].

A [[spacetime]] in exceptional field theory is locally modeled on the [[Cartesian product]] of a $d$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with a [[linear representation]] space of a form of the [[exceptional Lie group]] $E_{11-d}$. Fields on this spacetime are subject to satisfy a certain [[differential equation]] derived from an [[invariant]] form of the representation and one considers a generalized [[isometry]] algebra on this space which fails the [[Jacobi identity]] by a term proportional to this contraint (e.g. [Baguet-Hohm-Samtleben 15, section 2](#BaguetHohmSamtleben15)).
