## Idea

The _analytic assembly map_ is a natural [[morphism]] from $G$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[topological K-theory]] to the [[operator K-theory]] of a corresponding [[crossed product C*-algebra]].

More generally in equivariant [[KK-theory]] this is called the _Kasparov descent map_  and is of the form

$$
  KK^G(A,B) \to KK(G \ltimes A, G \ltimes B)
$$

where on the left we have $G$-equivariant KK-theory and on the right ordinary [[KK-theory]] of [[crossed product C*-algebras]] (which by the discussion there are models for the [[groupoid convolution algebras]] of $G$-[[action groupoids]]).

e.g. ([Land 13, section 2](#Land13))


## Properties

The [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] states that under some conditions the analytic assembly map is in fact an [[isomorphism]]. The [[Novikov conjecture]] makes statements about it being an [[injection]].
