## Idea 

In [[logic]], an incompleteness theorem expresses limitations on provability within a (consistent) formal [[theory]]. Most famously it refers to a pair of theorems due to [[Kurt Gödel]]; the first incompleteness theorem says roughly that for any [[consistent theory]] $T$ containing [[Peano arithmetic|arithmetic]] and whose [[axioms]] form a [[recursive set]], there is an arithmetic sentence which is true for the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ that cannot be proven in $T$. The second incompleteness theorem shows that for such theories $T$, the sentence can be taken to be a suitable arithmetization of the statement of consistency of $T$ itself, i.e., that no such theory "can demonstrate its own consistency" -- can prove an arithmetic statement that encodes the assertion of its consistency. 

An incompleteness theorem can be read as an [[undecidable proposition|undecidability result]]: there are formal propositions $p$ in the theory such that neither $p$ nor its [[negation]] $\neg{p}$ have [[proofs]] in the theory. As such, it is part of a long history; for example, axiom systems for [[Euclidean geometry]] not including the [[parallel postulate]] might not decide the parallel postulate, as shown by models for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. What was novel about Gödel's results is that they worked directly at the level of syntax and applied to any (effectively generated) extension of arithmetic, producing sentences which in effect imply their unprovability. 

## Gödel\'s incompleteness theorems 

To some extent, Gödel's incompleteness theorems have always had an air of mystery about them, or at least a reputation of being exceedingly difficult or subtle. The major insight of Gödel, that items in formal logic can be encoded within the recursive structures afforded by arithmetic ([[Gödel numbering]]), is of course a signal achievement not to be underestimated, and the detailed working out of the result that the provability predicate can be encoded as a [[recursive set]] can be said to form the technical core of this work. But the punchline, in the form of his [[diagonalization argument]] that produces a true[^fine1] but unprovable sentence, should be seen for what it is: one of many [[diagonalization arguments]] (including for example [[Cantor's theorem]]) that are essentially alike in structure, and familiar to all mathematicians. 

[[Yuri Manin]] writes in [Manin02, p. 7](#Manin02):

> Baffling discoveries such as Gödel’s incompleteness of arithmetic lose some of their mystery once one comes to understand their content as a statement that a certain algebraic structure simply is not finitely generated with respect to the allowed composition laws.

This diagonalization result, so often obscured, should be laid bare as the simple piece of algebra that it is. We give one approach here, based on the algebra of [[hyperdoctrines]].


### Categorical preliminaries 

We define the [[equational theory]] $\mathbf{PRA}$ ([[primitive recursive arithmetic]]) to be [[initial object|initial]] among [[Lawvere theories]] whose generator $1$ is a parametrized [[natural numbers object]]. The [[hom-set]] of morphisms $0 \to 1$ in $\mathbf{PRA}$ is the set of equivalence classes of closed [[terms]], and is identified with the set $\mathbb{N}$ of [[numerals]]. (This $\mathbb{N}$ will serve double duty in a moment, as being also the set of objects of the Lawvere theory.) 

The [[first-order theory]] of [[Peano arithmetic]], PA for short, can be presented as a [[Boolean hyperdoctrine]]

$$T: \mathbf{PRA}^{op} \to BooleanAlgebra$$ 

taking $j \in Ob(\mathbf{PRA}) = \mathbb{N}$ to the set $T(j)$ consisting of $j$-ary [[predicates]] in the language of PA, modulo provable equivalence in PA. If $f: j \to k$ is a morphism of $\mathbf{PRA}$ and $R \in T(k)$, we let $f^\ast (R)$ denote $T(f)(R) \in T(j)$; it can be described as the result of substituting or pulling back $R$ along $f$. There is a corresponding "action" of $\mathbf{PRA}$ on $T$, 

$$\mathbf{PRA}(j, k) \times T(k) \stackrel{action}{\to} T(j)$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$(f, R) \mapsto f^\ast(R),$$ 

which allows us to regard $T$ as a $\mathbf{PRA}$-module. 


### Syntactic terminology and notation 

Let $Form(PA)$ be the set of all formulas of PA, with $\Phi(j)$ the set of formulas with $j$ [[free variables]]. There is an equivalence relation on $\Phi(j)$, where two formulas $F, F'$ belong to the same equivalence class $[F]$ if they are provably equivalent in PA. Thus $[-]: \Phi(j) \to T(j)$ is the corresponding quotient map. Let $Term(0)$ denote the set of closed terms in the logical theory $PRA$; morphisms $0 \to 1$ in the Lawvere theory $\mathbf{PRA}$ are equivalence classes of terms, and we let $ev: Term(0) \to \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1)$ be the corresponding quotient map. The map $ev$ has a section $num: \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1) \to Term(0)$ which sends each morphism $0 \stackrel{'n'}{\to} 1$ to the corresponding numeral term (the $n$-fold successor of the zero term). Finally, we have a substitution map 

$$sub: Term(0) \times \Phi(1) \to \Phi(0)$$ 

that substitutes a closed term $\tau$ in for the free variable of $F \in \Phi(1)$, giving a closed formula $sub(\tau, F) \in \Phi(0)$.  

There is a standard Gödel coding taking formulas to numerals,  

$$code: Form(PA) \to \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1),$$ 

and we define an application pairing $\cdot$ to be the composite along the top of the following commutative diagram: 

$$\array{
Form(PA) \times \Phi(1) & \stackrel{code \times 1}{\to} & \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1) \times \Phi(1) & \stackrel{num \times 1}{\to} & Term(0) \times \Phi(1) &  \stackrel{sub}{\to} & \Phi(0) \\ 
 & & & _\mathllap{1 \times [-]} \searrow & \downarrow _\mathrlap{ev \times [-]} & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{[-]} \\ 
 & & & & \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1) \times T(1) & \underset{action}{\to} & T(0).
}$$ 

In other words, for all formulas $F \in Form(PA)$ and $R \in \Phi(1)$, we define the pairing $F \cdot R \coloneqq sub(num (code(F)), R)$, and according to the commutative diagram, we have the equation 

$$\label{eqn1} [F \cdot R] = code(F)^\ast ([R])$$ 

which will be used in our diagonalization result. 


### Diagonalization 

The following result is routine from general recursive-arithmetic properties of Gödel coding; it applies to any extension of PA (or just [[Robinson arithmetic]]) whose formulas can be recursively (computably) enumerated.  

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
There is a primitive recursive function (i.e., a morphism $d: 1 \to 1$ in $\mathbf{PRA}$) such that for all $t \in \Phi(1)$, we have $d \circ code(t) = code (t \cdot t)$.[^fine2] 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem #fix} 
###### Theorem 
For every $R \in \Phi(1)$ there is a fixed point in $\Phi(0)$, i.e., a closed formula $s \in \Phi(0)$ such that $s \Leftrightarrow s \cdot R$ ($s$ is provably equivalent to $s \cdot R$). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Pick a formula $t \in \Phi(1)$ such that $[t] = d^\ast [R]$, and then put $s = t \cdot t$. We want to show $[s] = [s \cdot R]$. We have 

$$\array{
[t \cdot t] & = & code(t)^\ast ([t]) & equation\; (1) \\ 
 & \coloneqq & code(t)^\ast (d^\ast [R]) & \\ 
 & = & (d \circ code(t))^\ast ([R]) & (functoriality) \\ 
 & = & (code (t \cdot t))^\ast ([R]) & (by\; the\; lemma)\\ 
 & = & [(t \cdot t) \cdot R] & equation\; (1) 
}$$ 

as required.

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
The proof of theorem \ref{fix} was written to lay bare its provenance as a special case of [[Lawvere's fixed point theorem]], and its essential kinship with the structure of the standard fixpoint combinator in [[combinatory algebra]]. See [Yanofsky 03](#Yanofsky03).

### Incompleteness 

Recall there is also a Gödel coding of PA proofs (certain sequences of PA formulas), $code: Proof(PA) \to \mathbf{PRA}(0, 1)$. The following result applies in fact to any theory like PA that extends basic Robinson arithmetic and whose axioms form a recursive set. 

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
There is a binary primitive recursive predicate $Pf$ such that $Pf(p, x)$ is true in $\mathbb{N}$ if $p$ is the code of a proof of a sentence (a closed formula) with code $x$. Thus there is an unary recursive predicate $Prov \coloneqq \exists_p Pf(p, x) \in T(1)$. Similarly, there is an unary recursive predicate $R = \neg Prov \in T(1)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
**(Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem)** 
There exists a sentence $s$ in the language of PA such that $s$ is logically equivalent to the PA-sentence $code(s)^\ast (\neg Prov)$ (whose interpretation in the model $\mathbb{N}$ is that $s$ has no PA proof). 
=-- 

Thus, if $s$ is false in $\mathbb{N}$, then $s$ has a PA proof (so that PA proves a false statement in a model: is inconsistent). In classical logic, the only other alternative is that $s$ is true in $\mathbb{N}$, but then this true sentence (in the language of PA) has no PA proof. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Indeed, let $R$ be a formula that represents the unary predicate $\neg Prov$, and let $s$ be a fixed point in the sense $[s] = [s \cdot R]$, which is guaranteed to exist by theorem \ref{fix}. The equality here is logical equivalence, and $[s \cdot R] = code(s)^\ast (\neg Prov)$ by equation (eq:eqn1).
