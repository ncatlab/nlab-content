[[About|This]] is a [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)-lab for collaborative work on _[[Mathematics]]_, _[[Physics]]_ and _[[Philosophy]]_ --- especially from the [[n-point of view]]: insofar as these subjects are usefully treated with tools and notions of [[category theory]] or [[higher category theory]].

##Purpose
{#purpose}

We think of this wiki as our **lab book** that we happen to keep open for all to see.

+-- {: .standout}

The **purpose of the $n$Lab** is to provide a public place where people can make notes about stuff. The purpose is not to make polished expositions of material; that is a happy by-product. 

We all make notes as we read papers, read books and doodle on pads of paper. The $n$Lab is somewhere to put all those notes, and, incidentally, to make them available to others. Others might read them and add or polish them. But even if they don't, it is still easier to link from them to other notes that you've made.

For more see [[About]].

We originally designed this place as as an adjunct to the [$n$-Category Caf&eacute;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/), but it\'s more independent now. 

## Discussion 

While we work on the $n$Lab, we talk to each other on the [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/). We inform ourselves about latest edits to the $n$Lab in the part [nForum -- latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/?CategoryID=5). Have a look around there. 

## Contributing 

If after looking around for a while you feel like contributing yourself, you are welcome to do so. But read [[About]] to be sure you understand what we are doing here (to the extent that we understand this ourselves, at least). Then see the [[HowTo]]-page for more details.

## Software requirements


The $n$Lab displays mathematical symbols using [MathML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML).  

Notice that **you don't need to know any MathML**. Only your browser does. You write formulas into the $n$Lab between dollar signs in [iTeX](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html), which is designed to be very similar to ordinary LaTeX.

Some web-browsers, notably [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), know how to display MathML automatically, although you may need to install some fonts.  For InternetExplorer one needs the [MathPlayer](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/) plugin; download is quick and easy and free. For more see [[HowTo]].




## Steering Committee 

The $n$Lab is a community undertaking. But for all matters that do require that the $n$Lab is represented to the outside by an official decision-taking body, we have the [[nlabmeta:steering committee|steering committee]]. _Nobody "is in charge of the $n$Lab"._ But the steering committee is the closest approximation to a body being in charge that we have.
