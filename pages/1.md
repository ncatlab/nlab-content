Welcome!

This is a [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)-lab for collaborative work on _[[Mathematics]]_, _[[Physics]]_ and _[[Philosophy]]_ â€” especially insofar as these subjects touch on [[higher category theory|higher algebraic structures]].  

We think of this wiki as our **lab book** that we happen to keep lying around openly.

We also think of this place as the library, or alchemist's laboratory, in the back room of the [$n$-Category Caf&eacute;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/). You go there to discuss things, and here to write them up.

We are hoping to create here a space for presentation and archival storage of collaborative work of encyclopedic, didactic, expositional,  but also original nature.  This will include, but not be limited to, the subjects being discussed every day in the $n$-Caf&eacute;.

But this site started operation only a few months ago. Some structure is beginning to appear, but we are still in a very early stage. Your help is appreciated! 

* See [[About]] for some ideas what the $n$Lab is trying to be, and what not.

* See the [[HowTo]]-page to get started if you want to contribute.

* See [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5) to get an idea of recent activity and to log your own changes to the $n$Lab.

* There is a [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum) (imaginatively called the $n$-Forum) for $n$Lab-related dicussion.

  * at [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5) we log our latest acivity on the $n$Lab

  * We also keep having constituive dscussion there. See for instance

    [What is the scope of the nLab? Particularly original research?](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=59)

    where we are trying to figure out what the $n$Lab is precisely.

* Distilled wisdom from the various discussions is starting to appear on the [[FAQ]].

**Software requirements**

The $n$Lab displays mathematical symbols using [MathML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML).  Some web-browsers, notably [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), know how to display this automatically, although you may need to install some fonts.  For InternetExplorer one needs the [MathPlayer](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/) plugin; download is quick and easy and free. For more see [[HowTo]].

Notice that **you don't need to know any MathML**. Only your browser does. You write formulas into the $n$Lab in plain LaTeX.
