## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] which is [[compact Lie group|compact]] and [[connected topological space|connected]]. Write $T \hookrightarrow G$ for the [[maximal torus]] [[subgroup]].

###### Definition

A **weight** on $G$ is an [[irreducible representation]] of the [[maximal torus]] [[subgroup]] $T \hookrightarrow G$.

###### Definition

For $\rho : G \to Aut(V)$ a [[representation]] of $G$, and for $\alpha : T \to Aut(\mathbb{C})$ a weight, the **weight space** of $\rho$ with respect to $\alpha$ is the [[subspace]] of $V$ which as a representation of $T$ is a [[direct sum]] of $\alpha$-s.

###### Remark

In other words, the weight space of a $G$-representation for a weight $\alpha$ is the corresponding [[eigenspace]] under the action of $T$.
