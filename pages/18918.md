## Idea

In [[algebraic geometry]] and [[arithmetic geometry]], a _rational point_ of an [[arithmetic scheme]] $S$ is a [[morphism]] $Spec(Q) \to S$ from the [[ring spectrum]] of the [[rational numbers]].

If $S$ is the [[algebraic variety]] of solutions to some [[polynomial]] [[equations]], then a rational point corresponds to a [[solution]] of these equations in the field of [[rational numbers]]
