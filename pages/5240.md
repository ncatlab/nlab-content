## Idea

The _monoid axiom_ is an extra condition on a [[monoidal model category]] that helps to make its [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category]] exist and be well behaved.

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

We say a [[monoidal model category]] satisfies the **monoid axiom** if every morphism that is obtained as a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushout]]s of [[tensor product]]s of acyclic fibrations with any object is a weak equivalence.

=--

This appears as [SchwedeShipley, def. 3.3.](#SchwedeShipley).

## Properties 

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

Let $C$ be a 

* [[cofibrantly generated model category]];

* [[symmetric monoidal category]];

* [[monoidal model category]].

Then if the monoid axiom hold for the set of generating acyclic cofibrations it holds for all acyclic cofibrations.

=--

This is ([SchwedeShipley, lemma 3.5](#SchwedeShipley)).

+-- {: .un_theorem #ExistenceOfModelstructureOnMonoids}
###### Theorem

If a [[monoidal model category]] satisfies the monoid axiom and 

* it is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]];

* all objects are [[small object]]s,

then the [[transferred model structure]] along the [[free functor]]/[[forgetful functor]] [[adjunction]] $(F \dashv U) : Mon(C) \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}} C$ exists on its [[category of monoids]] and hence provides a [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category|model structure on monoids]].

=--

This is part of ([SchwedeShipley, theorem 4.1](#SchwedeShipley)).

## Examples

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Monoidal model categories thatt satisfy the monoid axiom (as well as the other conditions sufficient for the [above theorem](ExistenceOfModelstructureOnMonoids) on the existence of transferred model structures on categories of monoids) include

* the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* the projective [[model structure on chain complexes]] for connective chanin complexes with fibrations the surjections in positibe degree

* the [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

* the [[model structure on Gamma-spaces]]

=--

This is in ([SchwedeShipley, section 5](#SchwedeShipley)).
