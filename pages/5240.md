## Idea

The _monoid axiom_ is an extra condition on a [[monoidal model category]] that helps to make its [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category]] exist and be well behaved.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

We say a [[monoidal model category]] satisfies the **monoid axiom** if every morphism that is obtained as a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of [[tensor products]] of acyclic cofibrations with any object is a weak equivalence.

([Schwede-Shipley 00, def. 3.3.](#SchwedeShipley)).

## Properties 

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

Let $C$ be a 

* [[cofibrantly generated model category]];

* [[symmetric monoidal category]];

* [[monoidal model category]].

Then if the monoid axiom holds for the set of generating acyclic cofibrations it holds for all acyclic cofibrations.

###### Theorem

If a [[monoidal model category]] satisfies the monoid axiom and 

* it is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]];

* all objects are [[small objects]],

then the [[transferred model structure]] along the [[free-forgetful adjunction]] $(F \dashv U) : Mon(C) \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}} C$ exists on its [[category of monoids]] and hence provides a [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category|model structure on monoids]].

## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Monoidal model categories that satisfy the monoid axiom (as well as the other conditions sufficient for the [above theorem](#ExistenceOfModelstructureOnMonoids) on the existence of transferred model structures on categories of monoids) include

* the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* the projective [[model structure on chain complexes]] for connective chanin complexes with fibrations the surjections in positibe degree

* the [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

* the [[model structure on Gamma-spaces]]
