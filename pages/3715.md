## Idea

_Deformation quantization_ is one formalization of the general idea of [[quantization]] of a [[classical mechanical system]]/[[classical field theory]] to a [[quantum mechanical system]]/[[quantum field theory]].

Deformation quantization focuses on the [[algebras of observables]] of a physical system (hence on the [[Heisenberg picture]]): it provides rules for how to [[deformation theory|deform]] the commutative algebra of classical observables to a non-commutative algebra of quantum observables. (This is in contrast to [[geometric quantization]], which focuses on the [[spaces of states]] and hence on the [[Schrödinger picture]].)

Usually and traditionally, _deformation quantization_ refers to (just) _formal_ deformations, in the sense that it produces [[formal power series]] expansions in a formal parameter $\hbar$ (physically: [[Planck's constant]]) of the product in the deformed algebra of observables. But there are refinements of this to [[C-star algebraic deformation quantization]] which studies the proper deformation to a genuine [[C-star algebra]] of observables.


As any other quantization, the deformation quantization has as an input a description of a [[classical mechanical system]], which is in this case most often a smooth [[Poisson manifold]]. The deformation quantization replaces the algebra of [[smooth functions]] on the Poisson manifold with the same [[vector space]], but equipped with new noncommutative [[associative algebra|associative unital product]] whose [[commutator]] agrees, up to order $\hbar$, with the underlying [[Poisson bracket]]. Of course the proper study of quantization of Poisson manifolds studied the appropriate notion at the level of [[sheaves]] of algebras. Gluing local solutions to the quantization problem furthermore involves [[stacks]] and specifically [[gerbes]].  

## Properties

### Existence results

[[Vladimir Drinfel'd]] has sketched a proof (and gave main ingredients) to show that every [[Poisson Lie group]] can be deformation quantized to a [[Hopf algebra]]; this proof has been completed by Etingof and Kazhdan. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] proved a certain *[[Kontsevich formality|formality theorem]]* (formality is here in the sense of [[rational homotopy theory]]) whose main corollary (and motivation) was the statement that every Poisson manifold has a deformation quantization ([Kontsevich 03](#Kontsevich)). 

For symplectic manifolds, the theory of deformation quantization is much simpler; [[Boris Fedosov]] gave a construction of star products on symplectic manifolds using symplectic connections on smooth manifolds.  An analogous argument was given by [[Roman Bezrukavnikov]] and [[Dmitry Kaledin]] in the context of an algebraic symplectic form.
