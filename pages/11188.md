Given a (possibly noncommutative) unital ring $R$ (left or right) nonzero $R$-module $M$ is __uniform__ if the intersection of any two nonzero submodules of $M$ is nonzero, or, equivalently, such
that every nonzero submodule of $M$ is [[essential submodule|essential]] in $M$.

A nonzero module $M$ is uniform iff its [[injective envelope]] $E(M)$ is indecomposable. 

An arbitrary $R$-module $M$ has finite rank if and only if it has an essential submodule which is a finite direct sum of uniform submodules.
