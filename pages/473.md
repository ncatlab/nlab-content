#History#

The original _tangle hypothesis_ was formulated in

* [[John Baez]] and [[James Dolan]], _Higher-dimensional Algebra and Topological Quantum Field Theory_ 1995 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503002)) 

as follows:

* **Tangle Hypothesis.** The $n$-category of framed $n$-tangles in $n+k$ dimensions is $(n+k)$-equivalent
to the free weak $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category with duals on one object.

In the limit $k \to \infty$, this gives:

* **Cobordism Hypothesis.** The $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms is the free stable $n$-category with duals on one object (the point).

In [[FQFT|extended toplogical quantum field theory]], which is really the representation theory of these cobordism $n$-categories, we expect:

* **Extended TQFT Hypothesis.** An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is a weak $n$-functor, preserving all levels of duality, from the $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms to $n Hilb$, the $n$-category of $n$-Hilbert spaces.

Putting the extended TQFT hypothesis and the cobordism hypothesis, we obtain:

* **The primacy of the point.** An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is completely described by the $n$-Hilbert space it assigns to a point.

Further discussion can be found here: 

* [[Bruce Bartlett]], _On unitary 2-representations of finite groups and topological quantum field theory_. PhD thesis, Sheffield (2008) ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3975))

More recently Mike Hopkins and Jacob Lurie have claimed 
(see [Hopkins-Lurie on Baez-Dolan](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html))
to have formalized and proven this hypothesis in the context of [[(n,r)-category|(infinity,n)-categories]] modeled on [[complete Segal space]]s. See:

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _On the classification of topological field theories_ ([pdf](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/cobordism.pdf))

where an [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] is defined and shown to lead to a formalization and proof of the _cobordism hypothesis_.  Lurie explains his work here:

Lecture notes for Lurie's talks should eventually appear at the [Geometry Research Group website](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/plowrey/dev/rtg/perspectives.html).

#Statement of the generalized tangle hypothesis#

The $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category of $G$-structured $n$-tangles in the $(n + k)$-cube is the [[fundamental category|fundamental]] $(n + k)$-category with duals of $(M G,Z)$.

* $M G$ is the Thom space of group $G$.
* $G$ can be any group equipped with a homomorphism to $O(k)$. ([comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006471))
