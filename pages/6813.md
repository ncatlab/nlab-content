## Idea

The theory of [[gravity]] in $3+1$ dimensions famously has [[black hole]] solutions, being the limiting configuration of a _point_ mass gravitational source. In higher dimensional gravity, and in particular in higher dimensional [[supergravity]], there are analogous solutions, which however are limiting configurations of a gravitational source that is supported on a line, or a surface, or a higher dimensional space. For a surface one might speak of _black [[membrane]]_ solutions hence generally of _black brane_ solutions.

Particularly the [[BPS states]] among the black branes in [[supergravity]], i.e. those solutions that carry [[Killing spinors]], include configurations that look like the strong-coupling version of the [[Green-Schwarz super p-branes]]. (Though, being extremal with [[naked singularity]], these are not strictly speaking "black" solutions.)

[[!include black branes in supergravity -- table]]

The [[near-horizon geometry]] of these black branes is generically that of [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] times a [[sphere]]. To the extent that the [[worldvolume]] theory of the branes is a [[superconformal QFT]], this is the origin of the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]].

## Properties

### Weak coupling correspondence

The types of black branes that can occur in theories of [[supergravity]] that are obtained from the maximal [[11-dimensional supergravity]] match precisely the types of [[D-brane]]s and [[NS-brane]]s that appear in the corresponding perturbative [[superstring theories]].

The idea is that both these brane-phenomena are aspects of one single entity: 

* At low string coupling the [[D-brane]]/[[NS-brane]] description is accurate. Low string coupling implies that the coupling of [[gravity]] is weak, hence that the back-reaction of the branes on the background geometry is negligible.

* At large string coupling but low energy, the [[effective field theory|effective]] [[supergravity]] description becomes accurate. Here the branes do back-react on the gravitational background and hence create the _black brane_ spacetime geometry.

This duality of the brane picture is at the heart of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. See there for more details.
