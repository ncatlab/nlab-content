_Nonabelian algebraic topology_ is a program developed by [Ronnie Brown](http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/index.html) and his collaborators. The idea is to redo and enhance algebraic topology by making use of the tool of [[strict omega-groupoid]]s and in particular the [[crossed complex]]es equivalent to them, which generalize the complexes of _abelian_ groups traditionally used in algebraic topology.


#Remarks#

* Nonabelian algebraic topology in particular provides a context for and makes use of [[nonabelian cohomology]].

* One of the main motivations for the development of Nonabelian algebraic topology was the observation that the [Seifert-van Kampen theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem) is most naturally understood as being not about homotopy groups, but about the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental infinitity-groupoid]] of a space. Since the assignment of fundamental $\infty$-groupoids to spaces is an $\infty$-category valued co-presheaf, one can understand this in the context of [[nonabelian cosheaf homotopy]]. Remarks on this are in the blog entry [Codescent and the van Kampen theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+cosheaf+homotopy).
