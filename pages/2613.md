In the last quarter of 2009, there is a seminar at UC Riverside on Cobordism and Topological Field Theories run by [[Julie Bergner]]. The seminar webpage is [here](http://www.math.ucr.edu/~jbergner/cobordism.htm). The goal is to work through recent notes of [[Jacob Lurie|Lurie]] giving an outline of his proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis|Cobordism Hypothesis]], relating [[cobordism]] classes of [[manifolds]] and [[TQFT|topological field theories]].  This work brings together several areas of recent mathematical interest: topological field theories, cobordisms of manifolds, and [[homotopy theory|homotopical approaches]] to [[higher category theory|higher categories]].  The basic definitions and examples of all of the above will be covered and then we'll work towards understanding Lurie's proof. 

The main reference is

[[Jacob Lurie|J. Lurie]], _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_

##### Friday, September 25 --- John Baez, Introduction to the cobordism hypothesis

[[John Baez]] kicked off the seminar with an introduction to the [[cobordism hypothesis]], how it began its life, and what it means in dimension $n=1$. Already here an issue of "framing" comes into play concerning the first [[Reidemeister move]].
