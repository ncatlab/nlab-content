## Definition

In a [[model category]] every [[morphism]] may be factored as a [[weak equivalence]] followed by a [[fibration]]. Specifically if the morphism is that to the [[terminal object]], this process finds a weakly equivalent [[fibrant object]].
This is a _fibrant replacement_ or [[resolution]] of the original object.

The dual concept is called _cofibrant replacement_.
