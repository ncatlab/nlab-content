## Idea

An **associated $\infty$-bundle** $E \to X$ is a [[fiber bundle]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with typical fiber $F \in \mathbf{H}$ that is classified by a [[cocycle]] $X \to \mathbf{B}\underline{Aut}(F)$ with coefficients in the [[delooping]] of the [[internalization|internal]] [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $F$.  We say this is _associated to_ the corresponding  $\underline{Aut}(F)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]. 

More generally there should be notions of accociated $\infty$-bundles whose fibers are objects in an [[(∞,n)-topos]] over $\mathbf{H}$ for some $n \gt 1$.

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]].

###### Definition

For $V,X \in \mathbf{H}$ two objects, say a _$V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] over $X$_ is a [[morphism]] $E \to X$ (an object in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$) such that there exists an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]] $U \to X$ and an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square

$$
  \array{
    U \times V &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    U &\to& X
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Let $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ be an [[∞-group]] equipped with an 
[[∞-action]] $\rho$ on $V$. Then for $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] over $X$, the _$\rho$-associated $\infty$-bundle_ is

$$
  P \times_G V \to X
  \,,
$$

where $P \times_G V := (P \times V)//G$ is the homotopy quotient of the diagonal $G$-action.

###### Remark

Below in _[Properties](#Properties)_ we see that every $\rho$-associated $\infty$-bundle is a $V$-fiber $\infty$-bundle and that every $V$-fiber $\infty$-bundle arises as associated to an  $\mathbf{Aut}(V)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]

###### Proposition

For $V \in \mathbf{H}$, write $\mathbf{Aut}(V) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ for the internal [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $V$. This comes with a canonical action on $V$. Then the operation of sending an $\mathbf{Aut}$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P \to X$ to the associated $P \times_G V \to X$ establishes an equivalence

$$
  H^1(X, \mathbf{Aut}(V)) \simeq \{V-fiber\;\infty-bundles\}
  \,.
$$


=--

More specifically, if $\rho$ is an [[∞-action]] of $G$ on some $V \in \mathbf{H}$, then under the [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  G Act \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
$$

it corresponds to a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    V &\to& V//G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\overline{\rho}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. This is the **universal $\rho$-associated $V$-bundle** in that for $P \to X$ any $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] modulated by $g \colon X \to \mathbf{B}G$ we have a natural equivalence

$$
  P \times_G V \simeq g^* \overline{\rho}
  \,.
$$

This is discussed in ([NSS, section I 4.1](#NSS)). 


### Presentation in simplicial presheaves



In ([Wendt](#Wendt)), section 5.5, a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the general situation for [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|1-localic]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] is given in terms of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (as discussed at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]]) .

Under this presentation we have:

###### Proposition

The universal $F$-$\infty$-bundle $\mathbf{E} F \to \mathbf{B}Aut(F)$ is presented by the [[bar construction]]

$$
  F \to B(*, Aut(F), F) \to B(*, Aut(F), *)

## Examples

### Fibrations of topological spaces / simplicial sets

For the special case that $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] and using the [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] by the [[model structure on topological spaces]]/[[model structure on simplicial sets]] the classification theorem \ref{Classification} reduces to the classical statement of ([Stasheff](#Stasheff), [May](#May)).

### $\infty$-Gerbes

In the case that the fiber $F$ is the [[delooping]] $F = \mathbf{B}G$ of an [[∞-group]] object $G$, the $\underline{Aut}(\mathbf{B}G)$-associated $\infty$-bundles are called **$G$-[[∞-gerbes]]**. See there for more details.

With the advent of [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] all these statements and their generalizations follow from the existence of [[object classifiers]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. For the classical case in [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]]${}^\circ$ [[sSet]]${}^\circ$ this is discussed in
