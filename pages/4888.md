## Idea

An **associated $\infty$-bundle** $E \to X$ is a [[fiber bundle]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with typical fiber $F \in \mathbf{H}$ that is classified by a [[cocycle]] $X \to \mathbf{B}Aut(F)$ with coefficients in the [[delooping]] of the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $F$.  We say this is _associated to_ the corresponding  $Aut(F)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]].
