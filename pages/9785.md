## Idea

A [[super Lie algebra]] which is a [polyvector](super+Poincare+Lie+algebra#PolyvectorExtensions) [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] ([[supersymmetry]]) in $D = 10+1$ for  $N=1$ [[supersymmetry]] by [[charges]] corresponding to the [[M2-brane]] and the [[M5-brane]] ("[[extended supersymmetry]]"). 


## Properties

### As the algebra of conserved currents of the M-branes

In ([AGIT 89](#AGIT89)) it is shows that the M-algebra-like polyvector extensions arise as the algebras of [[conserved currents]] of the [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma-models]].

By the discussion at [conserved current -- In higher prequantum geometry](conserved+current#InHigherPrequantumGeometry) this means that this is the degree-0 piece in the [[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]] which is induced by regarding the WZW-curvature terms as super [[n-plectic forms]] on $\mathbb{R}^{10,1|32}$.

### As the Lie algebra of derivation of the SuGra Lie 3-algebra

In ([Castellani 05](#Castellani05)) it is 
implicitly shown, ([FSS 13](#FSS13)), that the M-extension arises  as the [[derivations]]/automorphisms of the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]/[[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]] (see there for the details).

### As an 11-dimensional boundary condition for the M2-brane
 {#AsAn11DimensionalBoundaryCondition}

The original construction in ([D'Auria-Fre 82](#DAuriaFre82)) asks for a [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] $\mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert 32} \rtimes \mathfrak{g}$ of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert 32}$ such that the 4-[[cocycle]] $\mu_4 = \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a b} \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b$ for the M2-brane trivializes when pulled back to this:

$$
  \array{
    & & \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert 32} \rtimes \mathfrak{g}
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow_{\simeq} && \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert 32}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mu_4}}
    \\
    && B^{3}\mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

(In the language of [[local prequantum field theory]] this identifies a [[boundary condition]] for the WZW term of the M2-brane.)

They find, see also ([Bandos-Azcarraga-Izquierdo-PiconVarela 04](#BandosAzcarragaIzquierdoPiconVarela04)) that a solution for $\mathfrak{g}$ includes a fermionic extension of the M-theory super Lie algebra.

## References

The Polyvector extensions of $\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{10,1|32})$ were first considered in

where (a further fermionic extension of it) is derived as a [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of 11d [[super Minkowski spacetime]] on which the [[M2-brane]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|4-cocycle]] trivializes.

That a limiting case of this is given by the [[orthosymplectic super Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 32)$ is due to

* {#FernandezIzquierdoOlmo15} J.J. Fernandez, J.M. Izquierdo, M.A. del Olmo, _Contractions from $osp(1|32) \oplus osp(1|32)$ to the M-theory superalgebra extended by additional fermionic generators_,Nuclear Physics B Volume 897, August 2015, Pages 87–97 ([arXiv:1504.05946](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05946))


That the underlying bosonic [[body]] of this super Lie algebra happens to be the [[typical fiber]] of what would be the 11-d [[exceptional generalized tangent bundle]], namely the [level-2 truncation of the l1-representation](E11#FundamentalRepresentationAndBraneCharges) of [[E11]] according to ([West 04](E11#West04)) was highlighted in the review

In their global form, where differential forms are replaced by their de Rham cohomology classes on curved superspacetimes, these algebras were identified (for the case including the 2-form piece but not the 5-form piece) as the algebras of [[conserved currents]] of the [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma-models]] in
