__Yuri Vladimirovič Matiyasevich__ (also spelled Jurij/Yurij/Yurii Matijasevič/Matijasevich/Matiasevich, Rus. Ю́рий Влади́мирович Матиясе́вич) is a Russian
mathematician who obtained the negative solution to the Hilbert's tenth problem
By a seminal theorem of Matiyasevich, for every statement in mathematics (say ZF set theory) there is a Diophantine equation whose solvability is equivalent to the validity of the statement. This is not of much practical, but of large principal importance.
