Given a [[continuous map]] $f:X\to Y$ of [[topological space]]s, one can define its **mapping cylinder** as a [[pushout]] 

$$\array{
X&\stackrel{f}\to& Y \\
\sigma_0\downarrow && \downarrow f_*(\sigma_0)\\
X\times I &\stackrel{(\sigma_0)_* (f)}\to & Cyl(f)
}$$

where $I = [0,1]$ (the [[unit interval]]) and $\sigma_0:X\to X\times I$ is given by $x\mapsto (x,0)$. By tradition, homotopy theorists sometimes use the inverted (upside-down) mapping cone where $\sigma_0$ is replaced by $\sigma_1:x\mapsto (x,1)$. Of course the two mapping cones are homeomorphic so it is matter of convention which one to use, of course, compatibly with other constructions depending on the orientation of $I$. 

Set-theoretically, the mapping cone is $(X\times I \coprod Y)/{\sim}$ where $\sim$ is the smallest [[equivalence relation]] identifying $(x,0)\sim f(x)$ for all $x\in X$.

###### Theorem
A continuous map $i:A\to X$ is a [[Hurewicz cofibration]] iff there is a [[retraction]] $r:X\times I\to Cyl(f)$ for the canonical map $X\times I \to Cyl(f)$.

###### Theorem
A continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]] iff $X = X\times\{0\}$ is a [[deformation retract]] of the cylinder $Cyl(f)$.

###### Theorem
For any $f:X\to Y$, the composition 

$$X\stackrel{\sigma_1}\to X\times I\stackrel{(\sigma_0)_* (f)}\to Cyl(f)$$ 

is a [[cofibration]]. Furthermore, the map $r:Cyl(f)\to Y$ determined by $r([x,t])= f(x)$ (for all $x\in X$ and $t\in I$) and $r([y])=y$ (for $y\in Y$) is well defined and a homotopy equivalence. 

The composition $r\circ (\sigma_0)_* (f)\circ \sigma_1 = f$, hence this is a decomposition of a continuous map into a cofibration followed by a homotopy equivalence.
