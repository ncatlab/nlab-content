Israel Gelfand (1913 - 2009) played a preeminent role in Russian mathematics for many years.  His  legendary seminar in Moscow ran for 50 years, and set the pattern for many others, including Sullivan’s seminar at CUNY and Drinfeld’s at Chicago.    His name is attached to many mathematical achievements, including

* the [[Gelfand representation]] of a [[Banach algebra]],

* an important special case, the [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] describing commutative [[C*-algebra]]s,

* the [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] describing general C*-algebras,

* the [[Gelfand–Fuks cohomology]] of a [[foliation]],

* the [[Gelfand–Kirillov dimension]] of an [[associative algebra]],

* the [[Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand resolution]] for [[representation]]s of simple [[Lie group]]s.

He helped write a 5-volume work on [[distribution]] theory.
