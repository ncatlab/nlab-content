Colloquially, an **algebraic integer** is a solution to an equation 

$$x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_n = 0 \qquad (1)$$ 

where each $a_i$ is an [[integer]]. More precisely, an element $x$ belonging to an [[algebraic extension]] of $\mathbb{Q}$ is an (algebraic) integer, or more briefly is _integral_, if it satisfies an equation of the form (1). Alternatively, if $k$ is an algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., if $k$ is a number field), an element $\alpha \in k$ is integral if the subring $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \subseteq k$ is finitely generated as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module. 

This notion may be relativized as follows: given an [[integral domain]] in its [[field of fractions]] $A \subseteq E$ and a finite field extension $E \subseteq F$, an element $\alpha \in F$ is **integral** over $A$ if $A[\alpha] \subseteq F$ is finitely generated as an $A$-module. 

If $\alpha, \beta$ are integral over $\mathbb{Z}$ (say), then $\alpha + \beta$ and $\alpha \cdot \beta$ are integral over $\mathbb{Z}$. For, if $\beta$ is integral over $\mathbb{Z}$, it is _a fortiori_ integral over $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$, hence 

$$(\mathbb{Z}[\alpha])[\beta] = \mathbb{Z}[\alpha, \beta]$$ 

is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ and therefore, since $\alpha$ is integral, also finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$. It follows that the submodules $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha + \beta]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha \cdot \beta]$ are therefore also finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[Noetherian ring]]). Thus the integral elements form a ring. In particular, the integral elements in a number field $k$ form a ring often denoted by $\mathcal{O}_k$, usually called the **ring of integers** in $k$. This ring is a [[Dedekind domain]].
