The [[formal schemes]] are typically studied over noetherian local rings, or in Grothendieck school in somewhat larger generality of pseudocompact rings. However some very useful rings do not have any pseudocompact topology. Morris and Pereigis invented an extension of the theory of formal schemes over an arbitrary ground ring which involves some neat categorical ideas.
