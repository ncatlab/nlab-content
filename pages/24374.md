## Idea

**Synthetic guarded domain theory**, is a field of [[synthetic mathematics]] that provides an alternative to [[synthetic domain theory]], where all [[guarded recursion|guarded recursive]] definitions have [[fixed points]]. It provides a simple setting in which to carry out constructions using the technique of *step-indexing* in programming language semantics.

## Axiomatics

...

## Models

The most basic model of SGDT is given by the [[topos of trees]], the topos given by the category of [[presheaves]] on $\omega$, the first infinite [[ordinal]].
