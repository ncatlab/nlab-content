## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-valued **genus** is a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \mu : \Omega_{SO}  \to R
$$

from the [[bordism ring]]

$$
  \Omega_{SO} := \frac{closed\;oriented\;manifolds}{cobordisms}
  \,.
$$

The cobordism ring here^may be replaced by rings of cobordisms with extra structure.  And it may, at least in some cases, be refined to a [[cobordism ring spectrum]].

## Examples

* The [[Euler characteristic]] $X \mapsto \chi(X)$ is close to being 
  a genus, but is _not_ [[cobordism]] invariant
  
  (this is the [[index]] of the [[Dirac operator]] $D = d + d^\dagger$)

* The [[signature genus]];

* The [[A-hat genus]] is the [[index of a Dirac operator]] coming from 
  a [[spin bundle]];

* The [[elliptic genus]] or [[Witten genus]] may be interpreted as the
  index of a Dirac operator on loop space.
