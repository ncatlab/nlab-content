## Idea

For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-valued **genus** is a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma : \Omega_n  \to R
$$

from the [[bordism ring]].


The cobordism ring here may be replaced by rings of cobordisms with extra structure.  

### In homotopy theory / higher category theory

More generally, the notion of genus finds its natural interpretation in [[higher category theory]], where it is refined to a morphism of [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  \sigma : Bord_{(\infty,\infty)} \to R
$$

from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] for $n \to \infty$ to a [[ring spectrum]] $R$. This is equivalently the [[Thom spectrum]] (see at [[cobordism ring]] for more) and so a genus may be thought of as a morphism of [[spectra]]

$$
  \sigma : M O \to R
  \,.
$$



### In terms of quantum field theory

At least in some important cases, genera seem to be naturally understood as encoding [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theories]]. For $G$ some structure, the [[Thom spectrum]] $M G$ is the classifying space of [[manifolds]] with [[G-structure]], and hence may be thought of as classifying [[target spaces]] for [[sigma-models]]. The codomain spectrum $R$ itself may then be thought of as a classifying space for a certain class of QFTs, and hence the genus $\sigma : M G \to R$ can be thought of as assigning to any target space the corresponding [[sigma-model]]. 

This is for instance the case at least over the point for the [[A-hat genus]] $M Spin \to K O$, which may be thought of as sending manifolds with [[spin structure]] to the corresponding [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory|(1,1)-supersymmetric EFT]] ("[[spinning particle]]"); and for the [[Witten genus]] $M String \to tmf$, which can be thought of as sending a manifold with [[string structure]] to the corresponding [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and tmf|(2,1)-supersymmetric EFT]] ("[[heterotic string]]").

## Properties

### Rationalization

When the [[coefficient]] [[ring]] $R$ does not have additive [[torsion]], then any ring homomorphism

$$
  \phi \colon \Omega^{U/SO}_\bullet \longrightarrow R
$$

is detrmined already by its rationalization

$$
  \phi \colon \Omega^{U,SO}_\bullet\otimes \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow R \otimes \mathbb{Q}
$$

which is traditionally denoted by the same symbol. The rational [[cobordism rings]] in turn are known to be [[polynomial rings]]

$$
  \Omega^U_\bullet\otimes \mathbb{Q} \simeq \mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{C}P^1,\mathbb{C}P^2, \cdots ]
$$

$$
  \Omega^{SO}_\bullet\otimes \mathbb{Q} \simeq \mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{C}P^2,\mathbb{C}P^4, \cdots ]
$$

whose generators are identified with the cobordism classes of the manifolds which are the complex [[projective spaces]], as indicated.

### Characteristic series and Hirzebruch formula

Given a (rational) genus $\phi \colon \Omega^{U,SU}_\bullet\otimes \mathbb{Q} \to R \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ one defines (we follow ([Hopkins 94](#Hopkins94)))

1. its _logarithm_ to be the [[formal power series]] over $R \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ given by

   $$
     log_\phi(z) \coloneqq \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \phi(\mathbb{C}P^n) \frac{z^{n+1}}{n+1};
   $$

1. its _characteristic series_ to be the formal power series over $R \otimes \mathbb{Q}$

   $$
     K_\phi(z) \coloneqq \frac{z}{\exp_\phi(z)}
     \,,
   $$

   where $\exp_\phi$ is the inverse of the logarithm;

1. its _characteristic class_ as the [[universal characteristic class]] which via the [[splitting principle]] is fixed by its value on the universal line bundle as

   $$
     K_\phi(c_1) \in H^\bullet(B U(1),R \otimes \mathbb{Q})
   $$

   where $c_1 \in H^2(B U(1), \mathbb{Z})$ denotes the universal [[first Chern class]].

Then the central theorem of ([Hirzebruch 66](#Hirzebruch66)) expresses the genus of an arbitrary manifold $X$ via the formula

$$
  \phi(X)
  =
  \langle K_\phi(T X), [X] \rangle
  \,.
$$

## Examples

### Todd genus

The Todd genus  us the genus with logarithm

$$
  -log_{Todd}(1-x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{x^n}{n}
$$

### Euler characteristic

The [[Euler characteristic]] $X \mapsto \chi(X)$ is close to being  a genus, but is _not_ [[cobordism]] invariant
  
  (this is the [[index]] of the [[Dirac operator]] $D = d + d^\dagger$)

### Signature genus

The [[signature genus]];

### $\hat A$-genus

The [[A-hat genus]] is the [[index of a Dirac operator]] coming from a [[spin bundle]] in KO-theory. It is given by the characteristic series

$$
  K_{\hat A}(z) 
    = 
  \frac{z/2}{sinh(z/2)}
  =
  \frac{z}{e^{z/2} - e^{-z/2}}
  \,.
$$

The $\hat A$-genus is an [[integer]] on manifolds with [[spin structure]].


### Ochanine elliptic genus 

The Ochanin [[elliptic genus]] is that with logarith given by

$$
  log_{ell}(z) = \int_0^z (1-2 \delta t^2 + \epsilon t^4)^{-1/2} d t
$$

### Witten genus

The  [[Witten genus]] is the genus with characteristic series given by

$$
  \frac{z/2}{sinh(z/2)}
  \prod_{n \geq 1}
  \frac{(1-q^n)^2}{(1-q^n e^z)(1-q^n e^{-z})}
$$

The Witten genus takes values in $\mathbb{Z}[ [ q ] ]$ on manifolds with [[spin structure]]. On manifolds with [[string structure]] then its takes values in (the $q$-expansion of) [[modular forms]] for $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, meaning that setting $q = e^{2 \pi i \tau}$ then as a function $f$ of the parameter $\tau$ taking vakues in the [[upper half plane]] the Witten genus satisfies


$$
  f(-1/\tau) = (-\tau)^n f(\tau)
  \,.
$$
