## Idea

For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-valued **genus** is a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma : \Omega_n  \to R
$$

from the [[bordism ring]].


The cobordism ring here may be replaced by rings of cobordisms with extra structure.  

### In homotopy theory / higher category theory

More generally, the notion of genus finds its natural interpretation in [[higher category theory]], where it is refined to a morphism of [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  \sigma : Bord_{(\infty,\infty)} \to R
$$

from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] for $n \to \infty$ to a [[ring spectrum]] $S$. This is equivalently the [[Thom spectrum]] (see at [[cobordism ring]] for more) and so a genus may be thought of as a morphism of [[spectra]]

$$
  \sigma : M O \to R
  \,.
$$



### In terms of quantum field theory

At least in some important cases, genera seem to be naturally understood as encoding [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theories]]. For $G$ some structure, the [[Thom spectrum]] $M G$ is the classifying space of [[manifolds]] with [[G-structure]], and hence may be thought of as classifying [[target spaces]] for [[sigma-models]]. The codomain spectrum $R$ itself may then be thought of as a classifying space for a certain class of QFTs, and hence the genus $\sigma : M G \to R$ can be thought of as assigning to any target space the corresponding [[sigma-model]]. 

This is for instance the case at least over the point for the [[A-hat genus]] $M Spin \to K O$, which may be thought of as sending manifolds with [[spin structure]] to the corresponding [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory|(1,1)-supersymmetric EFT]] ("[[spinning particle]]"); and for the [[Witten genus]] $M String \to tmf$, which can be thought of as sending a manifold with [[string structure]] to the corresponding [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and tmf|(2,1)-supersymmetric EFT]] ("[[heterotic string]]").

## Examples

* The [[Euler characteristic]] $X \mapsto \chi(X)$ is close to being 
  a genus, but is _not_ [[cobordism]] invariant
  
  (this is the [[index]] of the [[Dirac operator]] $D = d + d^\dagger$)

* The [[signature genus]];

* The [[A-hat genus]] is the [[index of a Dirac operator]] coming from 
  a [[spin bundle]];

* The [[elliptic genus]] or [[Witten genus]] may be interpreted as the
  index of a [[Dirac operator]] on [[loop space]].
